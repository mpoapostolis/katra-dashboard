"15592858","Detecting components of hearing aid fitting using a self-assessment-inventory.","The evaluation of hearing-aid fitting includes numerous assessments such as electro- and psychoacoustic tests. The subjective estimation of the hearing aid user can be elicited with self-assessment inventories encompassing various parameters, e.g., benefit, satisfaction and usage. A questionnaire comprising 11 domains (disability, handicap, frequency and significance of the listening situation, importance of the hearing aid, expectation, demand, aided performance, benefit, satisfaction and usage) within three different conditions (speech in quiet and in noise and listening to sounds) was used to detect components underlying hearing aid fitting. The data show a three-factor structure (situation-, restriction- and aid-related variables) independent from the conditions. Usage depends on all of the three factors. Disability and handicap reveal the highest values for speech in noise, whereas the aid-related factor shows the lowest values for this condition. Global satisfaction with the hearing aid is significantly correlated with the aid-related factor, but independent from the restriction of hearing. The aid-related factor is positively influenced by the amount of social activity because more active persons report higher benefit and satisfaction for all listening conditions. Age does not exhibit a significant relationship to one of the components. Basically, all correlation coefficients are only intermediate, revealing that inter-individual differences of the patients are rather high. The data indicate that extra-audiological factors might also play an important role in the success of hearing aid fitting."
"15004647","Modeling and predicting hearing aid outcome.","Following a brief tutorial on the application of factor analysis to hearing aid outcome measures, three studies of hearing aid outcome measures in elderly adults are presented and analyzed. Two of the studies were completed at Indiana University (IU-1 and IU-2), and one was a collaborative multisite study by the Veterans Administration and the National Institute of Deafness and other Communication Disorders (NIDCD/VA). IU-1 measured hearing aid outcome in 173 elderly wearers of single-channel, linear, in-the-ear hearing aids with output-limiting compression, whereas IU-2 obtained the same extensive set of outcome measures from 53 elderly wearers of two-channel, wide-dynamic-range compression, in-the-canal hearing aids. In the NIDCD/VA study, 333 to 338 participants wore three single-channel circuits in succession, with each circuit housed within an in-the-ear shell. The three circuits included in that study and in this analysis were: (1) linear with peak clipping, (2) linear with output-limiting compression, and (3) single-channel, wide-dynamic-range compression. Evaluation of the many outcome measures completed in each study using principal components factor analysis revealed that from three (both IU studies) to five (NIDCD/VA study) principal components captured the individual differences in hearing aid outcome. This was independent of hearing aid type (in-the-ear or in-the-canal) and circuitry. Subsequent multiple regression analyses of individual differences in performance along each dimension of hearing aid outcome revealed that these individual differences could be accounted for reasonably well by various prefit variables for some dimensions of outcome, but not others. In general, measures of speech recognition performance were well accounted for by prefit measures, with the best predictors being hearing loss, cognitive performance, and age. Measures of hearing aid usage were less well accounted for by prefit measures, with the most accurate predictor of current hearing aid use being prior hearing aid use. The outcome dimension accounted for most poorly was that associated with hearing aid satisfaction, with subjective measures of aided sound quality being the best predictor of performance along this dimension of hearing aid outcome. Additional multicenter, large-scale studies are needed to develop more complete models of hearing aid outcome and to identify the variables that influence various aspects of hearing aid outcome. It is only through this additional research that it will be possible to optimize outcome for hearing aid wearers."
"16343355","A health policy for hearing impairment in older Australians: what should it include?","BACKGROUND: As in all western countries, Australia's older population experiences high levels of hearing impairment coupled with relatively low levels of hearing device usage. Poor hearing diminishes the quality of life of affected individuals and their families. This paper discusses how to improve Australian hearing health policies in order to better combat this impairment amongst older Australians.METHOD: We searched the databases Medline, Meditext and Web of Science to find articles that discussed strategies and innovations to assist the hearing health of older people, and related this material to observations made during the Blue Mountains Hearing Study in NSW between 1997 and 2003.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The literature search identified five areas for inclusion in a comprehensive hearing health policy in Australia. These are: early intervention; addressing of hearing aid expense; the use of assisted listening devices; hearing rehabilitation, and; screening and education. Further research in Australia is critical if we are to develop a strong approach to the increasing prevalence of age-related hearing loss.CONCLUSION: Australia needs to act now to address hearing impairment as it is a major cause of disability in those aged 55 and over. Federal and State governments should collaborate to construct a comprehensive hearing health policy that tackles poor levels of hearing health through early intervention, addressing hearing aid expense, encouraging the use of assisted listening devices, rehabilitation, screening and education. A good start would be to declare age related hearing impairment as a National Health Priority Area."
"15912340","[The first hearing aid increases mental capacity. Open controlled clinical trial as a pilot study].","BACKGROUND: According to the scientific literature, a hearing impairment which is acquired late reduces mental efficiency.OBJECTIVE: To determine by empirical examination whether hearing aids increase mental efficiency. PERSONS AND METHODS: An open controlled application study was carried out on the capacity of working memory in 15 first users of hearing aids.RESULTS: The working memory's capacity in the 15 users (age: 72+/-12 years; six females; crystallized IQ: 100+/-13; test-retest period: 74+/-35 days) increased 13+/-19% (IQ-increment 3.4+/-6.3 points), while the capacity of the 15 controls (age: 71+/-11 years; seven females; crystallized IQ: 103+/-12; test-retest period: 58+/-21 days) remained unchanged: 0+/-12% (IQ-change: -0.3+/-5.1 points). The difference between the samples is significant (p=0.012 one-tailed). The visually and auditively administered subtests yielded equal changes. According to self-reports, the daily wearing time was 6.7+/-3.5 h. Daily wearing times of the hearing aids (self-reports) of between 4-8 h showed the multiple IQ-gain compared to lesser or longer times. The audiometric gain in hearing without noise on the right (rho=0.58; significant), left (0.48; not significant), and on both sides (0.68; significant) correlated with IQ-gain.CONCLUSIONS: Under a more favourable usage a still more striking benefit is to be expected in mental efficiency."
"18503844","Measurement of hearing aid outcome in the elderly: comparison between young and old elderly.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate speech performance and subjective outcomes for older individuals who have hearing impairment and use digital hearing aids. The outcomes between young and old elderly users were compared.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with hearing loss fitted with digital hearing aids were included. They were divided into two groups. Group A consisted of 32 subjects aged 65 to 80 years, whereas group B had 27 subjects older than 80 years. Speech performance and subjective outcomes were measured 4 months after fitting of hearing aids. Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly-Screening Version (HHIE-S), Client Oriented Scale of Improvement (COSI), satisfaction, and usage questionnaires were used as subjective assessments.RESULTS: Improvements in speech performance were not significantly different between these two groups. There were no statistical differences in terms of HHIE-S score reduction, satisfaction rate, daily usage time, and COSI scores between both groups.CONCLUSION: Age by itself is not a limiting factor for older patients with hearing impairment to benefit from digital hearing aids."
"21090162","Tinnitus sound therapy with open ear canal hearing aids.","OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of open ear canal hearing aids in tinnitus treatment and to investigate the influence of gender, age, medication usage, tinnitus cause, tinnitus perception side, tinnitus pitch, pure tone audiometry, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, and minimal masking level on outcome.METHODOLOGY: One hundred tinnitus patients were evaluated by the tinnitus handicap inventory (THI) at the beginning of the study and after nine months of treatment. All subjects were submitted to counselling and sound enrichment from the simple sound amplification provided by the open ear canal hearing aids.RESULTS: Initial mean THI score was 54.22 (+/- 20.37) and final mean score was 28.32 (+/- 16.50), p &lt; 0.0001. No statistically significant correlations were found between THI value reduction and the studied parameters.CONCLUSION: Open ear canal hearing aids were useful in all tinnitus patients with mild hearing loss."
"20848364","Prevalence and degree of hearing loss among males in Beaver Dam cohort: comparison of veterans and nonveterans.","The Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study (EHLS) conducted in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, was a population-based study that focused on the prevalence of hearing loss among 3,753 participants between 1993 and 1995. This article reports the results of several auditory measures from 999 veteran and 590 nonveteran males 48 to 92 years of age included in the EHLS. The auditory measures included pure tone thresholds, tympanometry and acoustic reflexes, word recognition in quiet and in competing message, and the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly-Screening (HHIE-S) version. Hearing loss in the auditory domains of pure tone thresholds, word recognition in quiet, and word recognition in competing message increased with age but were not significantly different for the veterans and nonveterans. No significant differences were found between participant groups on the HHIE-S; however, regarding hearing aid usage, mixed differences were found."
"20046416","Hearing threshold of Korean adolescents associated with the use of personal music players.","PURPOSE: Hearing loss can lead to a number of disabilities and can reduce quality of life. Noise-induced hearing losses have become more common among adolescents due to increased exposure to personal music players. We, therefore, investigated the use of personal music player among Korean adolescents and the relationship between hearing threshold and usage pattern of portable music players.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 490 adolescents were interviewed personally regarding their use of portable music players, including the time and type of player and the type of headphone used. Pure tone audiometry was performed in each subject.RESULTS: Of the 490 subjects, 462 (94.3%) used personal music players and most of them have used the personal music player for 1-3 hours per day during 1-3 years. The most common type of portable music player was the MP3 player, and the most common type of headphone was the earphone (insert type). Significant elevations of hearing threshold were observed in males, in adolescents who had used portable music players for over 5 years, for those over 15 years in cumulative period and in those who had used earphones.CONCLUSION: Portable music players can have a deleterious effect on hearing threshold in adolescents. To preserve hearing, adolescents should avoid using portable music players for long periods of time and should avoid using earphones."
"21795978","Gender and hearing aids: patterns of use and determinants of nonregular use.","OBJECTIVE: Research addressing gender and hearing has focused mainly on differences in the auditory systems of men and women, communication, and psychological issues. Differences between men and women in the use of hearing aids are less clear. To date, no study has examined the effects of gender on hearing aid use as a primary aim. However, use patterns and underlying reasons for not using hearing aids may differ between men and women, or there might be a gender difference in the impact of some determinants on hearing aid use. A consideration of such factors could increase hearing aid use. Therefore, the aim of the present investigation was to provide information about gender-related influences on hearing aid use by examining differences in usage patterns and determinants of nonregular use.DESIGN: This study used cross-sectional survey data from 4979 adult male and 3410 adult female hearing aid owners in Switzerland in 2005. The survey data, including self-reported hearing aid use, were matched to the hearing loss data and the hearing aid technical information. Descriptive analyses were performed for the use patterns, age at first fitting, and audiogram slope. The determinants of nonregular use were examined using logistic regression models that were stratified by gender.RESULTS: Compared with men, women reported a higher prevalence of daily and regular use and a longer daily duration of use of hearing aids. Men more commonly indicated a limited benefit as a reason for nonregular use. The multivariate analyses showed that nonregular use was significantly less likely in women. The audiogram slope strongly contributed to this difference. Stratified analyses showed that for both men and women, poor handling and low satisfaction were associated with a higher likelihood for nonregular hearing aid use. Associations were discrepant for asymmetric hearing loss, which was a risk factor in women but a protective factor in men. Higher risks of nonregular use were found in men with steeper audiogram slopes and longer durations of ownership of their current aids, in women fitted with their first aid in the previous 2 to 5 yr, and in women older than 65 yr.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the present study provides evidence of gender-specific factors that influence hearing aid use patterns in men and women and of groups at higher risk for nonregular hearing aid use. Men with steeper audiogram slopes and the other subgroups of men and women with an increased risk for nonregular use should given particular attention when fitting their aids. As common risk factors for nonregular use, poor handling and low satisfaction should be addressed during the fitting process for all users. Further research is needed to clarify the differential influence of asymmetric hearing loss on hearing aid use in men and women. This information could improve hearing aid use and should be incorporated into daily clinical practice."
"21595614","[Hearing aid use and patient satisfaction].","OBJECTIVES: In this study, we assessed the hearing aid usage ratios and durations, patient satisfaction and the probable causes of disuse if they are not used.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A questionnaire with 16 questions was applied to the patients who were prescribed hearing aids in our clinic between January 2007 and December 2009. A total of 517 patients were called by phone. Hundred and seventy-nine of the patients (75 females, 104 males; mean age 60±23 years; range 17 to 94 years) participated in the trial. Hearing aid usage ratios and patients' satisfaction were determined and the factors influencing usage were statistically investigated.RESULTS: Hundred and forty-two of the patients used their hearing aids regularly and 37 of the patients either used their aids rarely or never used them. The most common cause reported for disuse was the frequent noise coming from the hearing aid.CONCLUSION: Failure to explain the usage of the hearing aids to the patients and age over 70 years have a statistically significant negative effect on the duration of hearing aid use and patient satisfaction."
"21514179","Incidence and predictors of hearing aid use and ownership among older adults with hearing loss.","PURPOSE: The reasons are not clear as to why people who need hearing aids and possess them do not use them. We aimed to describe the incidence and predictors of hearing aid ownership and use among older adults.METHODS: We included 2,015 Blue Mountains Hearing Study participants aged =55 years who were examined between 1997 and 1999 and 2002 and 2004. Hearing levels were measured with pure-tone audiometry.RESULTS: The 5-year incidence of hearing aid use and ownership was 8.1% and 8.5%, respectively. Age was associated with incident hearing aid ownership and use, multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR) per decade increase in age of 1.79 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-2.64) and of 1.66 (95% CI, 1.15-2.40), respectively. Any level of hearing loss (HL) at baseline predicted a 2.8-fold increased likelihood of using a hearing aid at follow-up. Hearing handicap was associated with 7% increased likelihood of incident aid use. Key reasons provided for not obtaining/using a hearing aid were: not recommended one (8.0%), its high cost (1.7%), and believing that they did not need one (9.0%).CONCLUSIONS: Incident hearing aid ownership and usage was relatively low among hearing impaired adults. Age, question-defined hearing handicap, and measured HL were significant predictors of incident hearing aid use/ownership."
"21376005","Use of hearing AIDS and assistive listening devices in an older Australian population.","BACKGROUND: Hearing loss is a common sensory impairment experienced by older persons. Evidence shows that the use of hearing aids and/or assistive listening devices (ALDs) can benefit those with a hearing loss but that historically the uptake and use of these technologies has remained relatively low compared with the number of people who report a hearing loss.PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, usage, and factors associated with the use of hearing aids and ALDs in an older representative Australian population.RESEARCH DESIGN: A population-based survey.STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 2956 persons out of 3914 eligible people between the ages of 49 and 99 yr (mean age 67.4 yr), living in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, completed a hearing study conducted from 1997 to 2003.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Hearing levels were assessed using pure tone audiometry, and subjects were administered a comprehensive hearing survey by audiologists, which included questions about hearing aid and ALD usage. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with hearing aid and ALD usage.RESULTS: Of the surveyed population, 33% had a hearing loss as measured in the better ear. 4.4% had used an ALD in the past 12 mo, and 11% owned a hearing aid. Of current hearing aid owners, 24% never used their aids. ALD and hearing aid usage were found to be associated with increasing age, hearing loss, and self-perceived hearing disability.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that hearing aid ownership and ALD usage remains low in the older population. Given the significant proportion of older people who self-report and have a measured hearing loss, it is possible that more could be helped through the increased use of hearing aid and/or ALD technology. Greater efforts are needed to promote the benefits of these technologies and to support their use among older people with hearing loss."
"22568994","Hearing disability measured by the speech, spatial, and qualities of hearing scale in clinically normal-hearing and hearing-impaired middle-aged persons, and disability screening by means of a reduced SSQ (the SSQ5).","OBJECTIVES: : The goals of the present study were twofold: in the first part, the prevalence and profile of hearing disability in healthy, middle-aged persons were determined by the speech, spatial, and qualities of hearing scale (SSQ). In the second part of this study, the number of SSQ items was reduced to five to make this questionnaire available for routine usage in clinical settings and for screening purposes.METHODS: : SSQ responses derived from 103 normal-hearing 18- to 25-year-old persons were compared with the SSQ responses of 24 clinically normal-hearing (all thresholds between 125 and 8000 Hz =25 dB HL) and 109 healthy, 55- to 65-year-old persons with age-related hearing impairment to determine the prevalence and profile of hearing disability. The 45 items of the SSQ were reduced to five by cluster analyses and binary logistic regression analyses. The robustness of this five-item version (SSQ5) was determined in three control populations: an adult 25- to 55-year-old population (n = 159), an ENT-patient population (n = 60), and a population of hearing aid candidates (n = 50). The feasibility of the SSQ5 for screening was compared with the feasibility of the simple question &quot;Do you have hearing loss?&quot; by determining, respectively, the sensitivity, specificity, and maximum achievable discriminatory power for predicting hearing status according to speech-in-noise performance.RESULTS: : Prevalence numbers showed data of healthy, middle-aged persons with significant disability, despite minimal impairment (25%) versus data of middle-aged persons with significant impairment and nevertheless, minimal disability (61%). The profile of hearing disability seemed similar in all normal-hearing and hearing-impaired subgroups (i.e., most problems with understanding speech especially in noise conditions, and least problems with sound quality). Compared with the single question: &quot;Do you have hearing loss?&quot; the use of the SSQ5 had 37% more maximum discriminatory power for determining hearing status category based on speech-in-noise performance in 55- to 65-year-old persons. In addition, the SSQ5 seemed robust in adult populations of different ages (89.6% correlation between the answers of the SSQ5 and SSQ45), as well as in ENT-patient populations (93.7% correlation) and hearing aid candidate populations (79.2% correlation).CONCLUSIONS: : The results of this study suggest that disability measures and measures for hearing impairment cannot replace each other, but are complementary. Therefore, it is advised to implement both disability measures and impairment measures in screening and referral policies for hearing loss. To get a first impression of hearing disability, our results suggest that it is useful to ask five disability questions (SSQ5) instead of one general question like &quot;Do you have hearing loss?&quot;"
"22479312","A systematic review of studies measuring and reporting hearing aid usage in older adults since 1999: a descriptive summary of measurement tools.","OBJECTIVE: A systematic review was conducted to identify and quality assess how studies published since 1999 have measured and reported the usage of hearing aids in older adults. The relationship between usage and other dimensions of hearing aid outcome, age and hearing loss are summarised.DATA SOURCES: Articles were identified through systematic searches in PubMed/MEDLINE, The University of Nottingham Online Catalogue, Web of Science and through reference checking.STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: (1) participants aged fifty years or over with sensori-neural hearing loss, (2) provision of an air conduction hearing aid, (3) inclusion of hearing aid usage measure(s) and (4) published between 1999 and 2011.RESULTS: Of the initial 1933 papers obtained from the searches, a total of 64 were found eligible for review and were quality assessed on six dimensions: study design, choice of outcome instruments, level of reporting (usage, age, and audiometry) and cross validation of usage measures. Five papers were rated as being of high quality (scoring 10-12), 35 papers were rated as being of moderate quality (scoring 7-9), 22 as low quality (scoring 4-6) and two as very low quality (scoring 0-2). Fifteen different methods were identified for assessing the usage of hearing aids.CONCLUSIONS: Generally, the usage data reviewed was not well specified. There was a lack of consistency and robustness in the way that usage of hearing aids was assessed and categorised. There is a need for more standardised level of reporting of hearing aid usage data to further understand the relationship between usage and hearing aid outcomes."
"24145259","The quality of life in hearing impaired adolescents after hearing aid application.","Hearing impairment in adolescents is a major public health problem. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) deafness and hearing impairment are common health problems throughout the world. Hearing impairment generally impairs emotional, social, communication and educational function. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between duration of hearing aid use and improvements in the quality of life. The cross sectional study was conducted at Jalan Peel Primary Special School and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Center (UKMMC) from July 2010 until June 2011. A total of 21 students with hearing impairment involved in this study with mean age of 12.57 (10 to 19 years old). The subjects were divided into 2 groups: first-time hearing aid users and long standing hearing aid users. The hearing assessment was conducted in the first group and hearing aids were fitted. After 1 month hearing aid fitting, the questionnaires were distributed to both groups. Statistical analysis had showed no relation (p&gt;0.05) between duration of hearing aid use and the improvement in the quality of life. However, regardless of the duration of hearing aid usage, there was improvement in the quality of life as shown by the scores of the questionnaires. In conclusion there was no significant relation between duration of hearing aid use and the improvement in the quality of life. Hearing aids were beneficial for hearing loss students regardless of the duration of the hearing aid usage. "
"23659867","Internet access and use in adults with hearing loss.","BACKGROUND: The future rehabilitation of adults with hearing loss is likely to involve online tools used by individuals at home. Online tools could also be useful for people who are not seeking professional help for their hearing problems. Hearing impairment is a disability that increases with age, and increased age is still associated with reduced use of the Internet. Therefore, to continue the research on online audiological rehabilitative tools for people with hearing loss, it is important to determine if and to what extent adults with hearing loss use the Internet.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of the Internet and email in a group of adults with hearing loss and to investigate if their use of Internet and email differed between genders, among different age groups, and how it compared with the general population in Sweden.METHODS: Questionnaires containing multiple-choice questions about Internet access, email use, and educational level were mailed to individuals with hearing loss, who were registered as patients at a hearing aid clinic. Out of the 269 invited participants, 158 returned a completed questionnaire, which was a response rate of 58.7%.RESULTS: The results showed that 60% (94/158) of the participants with hearing loss used computers and the Internet. The degree of hearing loss in the group of participants did not explain the level of Internet usage, while factors of age, gender, and education did (P&lt;.001). More men than women used the Internet (OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.32-4.91, P&lt;.001). Use of the Internet was higher in the youngest age group (25-64 years) compared to the oldest age group (75-96 years, P=.001). A higher usage of the Internet was observed in the participants with hearing loss, especially the elderly, when compared with the general population of Sweden (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.23-3.17, P=.04).CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the use of computers and the Internet overall is at least at the same level for people with hearing loss as for the general age-matched population in Sweden, but that this use is even higher in specific age groups. These results are important for the future work in developing and evaluating rehabilitative educational online tools for adults with hearing loss."
"23473329","Why do people fitted with hearing aids not wear them?","OBJECTIVE: Age-related hearing loss is an increasingly important public health problem affecting approximately 40% of 55-74 year olds. The primary clinical management intervention for people with hearing loss is hearing aids, however, the majority (80%) of adults aged 55-74 years who would benefit from a hearing aid, do not use them. Furthermore, many people given a hearing aid do not wear it. The aim was to collate the available evidence as to the potential reasons for non-use of hearing aids among people who have been fitted with at least one.DESIGN: Data were gathered via the use of a scoping study.STUDY SAMPLE: A comprehensive search strategy identified 10 articles reporting reasons for non-use of hearing aids.RESULTS: A number of reasons were given, including hearing aid value, fit and comfort and maintenance of the hearing aid, attitude, device factors, financial reasons, psycho-social/situational factors, healthcare professionals attitudes, ear problems, and appearance.CONCLUSIONS: The most important issues were around hearing aid value, i.e. the hearing aid not providing enough benefit, and comfort related to wearing the hearing aid. Identifying factors that affect hearing aid usage are necessary for devising appropriate rehabilitation strategies to ensure greater use of hearing aids."
"25538617","The effect of functional hearing loss and age on long- and short-term visuospatial memory: evidence from the UK biobank resource.","The UK Biobank offers cross-sectional epidemiological data collected on &gt;500,000 individuals in the UK between 40 and 70 years of age. Using the UK Biobank data, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of functional hearing loss and hearing aid usage on visuospatial memory function. This selection of variables resulted in a sub-sample of 138,098 participants after discarding extreme values. A digit triplets functional hearing test was used to divide the participants into three groups: poor, insufficient and normal hearers. We found negative relationships between functional hearing loss and both visuospatial working memory (i.e., a card pair matching task) and visuospatial, episodic long-term memory (i.e., a prospective memory task), with the strongest association for episodic long-term memory. The use of hearing aids showed a small positive effect for working memory performance for the poor hearers, but did not have any influence on episodic long-term memory. Age also showed strong main effects for both memory tasks and interacted with gender and education for the long-term memory task. Broader theoretical implications based on a memory systems approach will be discussed and compared to theoretical alternatives. "
"25262621","Structural alterations of brain grey and white matter in early deaf adults.","Functional and structural brain alterations in the absence of the auditory input have been described, but the observed structural brain changes in the deaf are not uniform. Some of the previous researchers focused only on the auditory areas, while others investigated the whole brain or other selected regions of interest. Majority of studies revealed decreased white matter (WM) volume or altered WM microstructure and preserved grey matter (GM) structure of the auditory areas in the deaf. However, preserved WM and increased or decreased GM volume of the auditory areas in the deaf have also been reported. Several structural alterations in the deaf were found also outside the auditory areas, but these regions differ between the studies. The observed differences between the studies could be due to the use of different single-analysis techniques, or the diverse population sample and its size, or possibly due to the usage of hearing aids by some participating deaf subjects. To overcome the aforementioned limitations four different image-processing techniques were used to investigate changes in the brain morphology of prelingually deaf adults who have never used hearing aids. GM and WM volume of the Heschl's gyrus (HG) were measured using manual volumetry, while whole brain GM volume, thickness and surface area were assessed by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and surface-based analysis. The microstructural properties of the WM were evaluated by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The data were compared between 14 congenitally deaf adults and 14 sex- and age-matched normal hearing controls. Manual volumetry revealed preserved GM volume of the bilateral HG and significantly decreased WM volume of the left HG in the deaf. VBM showed increased cerebellar GM volume in the deaf, while no statistically significant differences were observed in the GM thickness or surface area between the groups. The results of the DTI analysis showed WM microstructural alterations between the groups in the bilateral auditory areas, including the superior temporal gyrus, the HG, the planum temporale and the planum polare, which were more extensive in the right hemisphere. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was significantly reduced in the right and axial diffusivity (AD) in the left auditory areas in the deaf. FA and AD were significantly reduced also in several other brain areas outside the auditory cortex in the deaf. The use of four different methods used in our study, although showing changes that are not directly related, provides additional information and supports the conclusion that in prelingually deaf subjects structural alterations are present both in the auditory areas and elsewhere. Our results support the findings of those studies showing that early deafness results in decreased WM volume and microstructural WM alterations in the auditory areas. As we observed WM microstructural alteration also in several other areas and increased GM volume in the cerebellum in the deaf, we can conclude that early deafness results in widespread structural brain changes. These probably reflect atrophy or degradation as well as compensatory cross-modal reorganisation in the absence of the auditory input and the use of the sign language. "
"24917904","Advantages of binaural amplification to acceptable noise level of directional hearing aid users.","OBJECTIVES: The goal of the present study was to examine whether Acceptable Noise Levels (ANLs) would be lower (greater acceptance of noise) in binaural listening than in monaural listening condition and also whether meaningfulness of background speech noise would affect ANLs for directional microphone hearing aid users. In addition, any relationships between the individual binaural benefits on ANLs and the individuals' demographic information were investigated.METHODS: Fourteen hearing aid users (mean age, 64 years) participated for experimental testing. For the ANL calculation, listeners' most comfortable listening levels and background noise level were measured. Using Korean ANL material, ANLs of all participants were evaluated under monaural and binaural amplification with a counterbalanced order. The ANLs were also compared across five types of competing speech noises, consisting of 1- through 8-talker background speech maskers. Seven young normal-hearing listeners (mean age, 27 years) participated for the same measurements as a pilot testing.RESULTS: The results demonstrated that directional hearing aid users accepted more noise (lower ANLs) with binaural amplification than with monaural amplification, regardless of the type of competing speech. When the background speech noise became more meaningful, hearing-impaired listeners accepted less amount of noise (higher ANLs), revealing that ANL is dependent on the intelligibility of the competing speech. The individuals' binaural advantages in ANLs were significantly greater for the listeners with longer experience of hearing aids, yet not related to their age or hearing thresholds.CONCLUSION: Binaural directional microphone processing allowed hearing aid users to accept a greater amount of background noise, which may in turn improve listeners' hearing aid success. Informational masking substantially influenced background noise acceptance. Given a significant association between ANLs and duration of hearing aid usage, ANL measurement can be useful for clinical counseling of binaural hearing aid candidates or unsuccessful users."
"24828219","Patterns of hearing aid usage predict hearing aid use amount (data logged and self-reported) and overreport.","BACKGROUND: Previous studies found that, on average, users overreport their daily amount of hearing aid use compared to objective measures such as data logging. However, the reasons for this are unclear.PURPOSE: This study assessed data-logged and self-reported amount of hearing aid use in a clinical sample of hearing aid users. It identified predictors of data-logged hearing aid use, self-reported hearing aid use, and hearing aid use overreport.RESEARCH DESIGN: This observational study recruited adult hearing aid users from 22 private dispensers in the Netherlands and in Denmark.STUDY SAMPLE: The sample consisted of 228 hearing aid users. Typical participants were over the age of 65 and retired, were fitted binaurally, and had financially contributed to the cost of their hearing aids. Participants had on average a mild-to-severe sloping bilateral hearing impairment.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Participants completed a purposefully designed questionnaire regarding hearing aid usage and the International Outcome Inventory-Hearing Aids. Dispensers collected audiometric results and data logging. Multiple linear regression identified predictors of data-logged hearing aid use, self-reported hearing aid use, and hearing aid use overreport when controlling for covariates.RESULTS: Data logging showed on average 10.5 hr of hearing aid use (n = 184), while participants reported on average 11.8 hr of daily hearing aid use (n = 206). In participants for which both data-logged and self-reported hearing aid use data were available (n = 166), the average absolute overreport of daily hearing aid use was 1.2 (1 hr and 11 min). Relative overreport was expressed as a rate of absolute overreport divided by data-logged hearing aid use. A positive rate denotes hearing aid use overreport: the average overreport rate was .38. Cluster analysis identified two data-logged patterns: &quot;Regular,&quot; where hearing aids are typically switched on for between 12 and 20 hr before their user powers them off (57% of the sample), and &quot;On-off,&quot; where hearing aids are typically switched on for shorter periods of time before being powered off (43% of the sample). In terms of self-report, 77% of the sample described their hearing aid use to be the same every day, while 23% of the sample described their hearing aid use to be different from day to day. Participants for whom data logging showed an On-off pattern or who reported their hearing aid use to be different from day to day had significantly fewer data-logged and self-reported hours of hearing aid use. Having an On-off data-logging pattern or describing hearing aid use as the same every day was associated with a significantly greater hearing aid use overreport.CONCLUSIONS: Data-logged and self-reported usage patterns significantly predicted data-logged hearing aid use, self-reported hearing aid use, and overreport when controlling for covariates. The results point to patterns of hearing aid usage as being at least as important a concept as amount of hearing aid use. Dispensers should discuss not only the &quot;how much&quot;, but also the &quot;how&quot; of hearing aid usage with their clients."
"24714854","Hearing aid handling skills: relationship with satisfaction and benefit.","PURPOSE: To evaluate hearing aid handling skills for new and experienced users and to assess if such skills influence user's benefit and satisfaction.METHODS: Seventy four participants (mean age of 70.43), experienced (n=37) or new hearing aid users (n=37) performed the tasks of &quot;Practical Hearing Aid Skills Test&quot; (PHAST), which were scored on a five-point Likert scale - higher scores indicate better hearing aid handling skills. Experienced users answered the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA) and the hearing aid benefit for handicap reduction was calculated by the hearing handicap inventory (HHIA/HHIE).RESULTS: Medians for PHAST total scores of 79 and 71% were obtained for experienced and new users, respectively - there were no significant difference between groups. Lower PHAST scores were observed for the tasks of volume control manipulation and telephone usage. Moderate correlations were obtained between IOI benefit and quality of life items and the PHAST scores. There was no correlation between the results of PHAST and demographic data of the participants.CONCLUSION: There was no difference in handling skills between new and experienced hearing aid users. Handling skills affected hearing aid benefit."
"26244401","The Effect of Functional Hearing and Hearing Aid Usage on Verbal Reasoning in a Large Community-Dwelling Population.","OBJECTIVES: Verbal reasoning performance is an indicator of the ability to think constructively in everyday life and relies on both crystallized and fluid intelligence. This study aimed to determine the effect of functional hearing on verbal reasoning when controlling for age, gender, and education. In addition, the study investigated whether hearing aid usage mitigated the effect and examined different routes from hearing to verbal reasoning.DESIGN: Cross-sectional data on 40- to 70-year-old community-dwelling participants from the UK Biobank resource were accessed. Data consisted of behavioral and subjective measures of functional hearing, assessments of numerical and linguistic verbal reasoning, measures of executive function, and demographic and lifestyle information. Data on 119,093 participants who had completed hearing and verbal reasoning tests were submitted to multiple regression analyses, and data on 61,688 of these participants, who had completed additional cognitive tests and provided relevant lifestyle information, were submitted to structural equation modeling.RESULTS: Poorer performance on the behavioral measure of functional hearing was significantly associated with poorer verbal reasoning in both the numerical and linguistic domains (p &lt; 0.001). There was no association between the subjective measure of functional hearing and verbal reasoning. Functional hearing significantly interacted with education (p &lt; 0.002), showing a trend for functional hearing to have a greater impact on verbal reasoning among those with a higher level of formal education. Among those with poor hearing, hearing aid usage had a significant positive, but not necessarily causal, effect on both numerical and linguistic verbal reasoning (p &lt; 0.005). The estimated effect of hearing aid usage was less than the effect of poor functional hearing. Structural equation modeling analyses confirmed that controlling for education reduced the effect of functional hearing on verbal reasoning and showed that controlling for executive function eliminated the effect. However, when computer usage was controlled for, the eliminating effect of executive function was weakened.CONCLUSIONS: Poor functional hearing was associated with poor verbal reasoning in a 40- to 70-year-old community-dwelling population after controlling for age, gender, and education. The effect of functional hearing on verbal reasoning was significantly reduced among hearing aid users and completely overcome by good executive function skills, which may be enhanced by playing computer games."
"26070470","On the relationship between functional hearing and depression.","OBJECTIVE: To establish the effect of self-rated and measured functional hearing on depression, taking age and gender into account. Additionally, the study investigates if hearing-aid usage mitigates the effect, and if other physical health problems and social engagement confound it.DESIGN: Cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank resource, including subjective and behavioural measures of functional hearing and multifactorial measures of depressive episodes and symptoms, were accessed and analysed using multi-regression analyses.STUDY SAMPLE: Over 100 000 community-dwelling, 39-70 year-old volunteers.RESULTS: Irrespective of measurement method, poor functional hearing was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) associated with higher levels of depressive episodes (= 0.16 factor scores) and depressive symptoms (= 0.30 factor scores) when controlling for age and gender. Associations were stronger for subjective reports, for depressive symptoms, and the younger participants. Females generally reported higher levels of depression. Hearing-aid usage did not show a mitigating effect on the associations. Other physical health problems particularly partially confounded the effects.CONCLUSION: Data support an association between functional hearing and depression that is stronger in the younger participants (40-49 years old) and for milder depression. The association was not alleviated by hearing-aid usage, but was partially confounded by other physical health problems."
"26050856","Study of hearing aid effectiveness and patient satisfaction.","OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate hearing aid using rate, patient satisfaction rate and achievements in social communication of patients by assessing the hearing thresholds before and after device use in patients who were determined as suitable for hearing aid use.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Hundred eighty patients who were admitted to Otolaryngology Clinic of Sakarya University Medical Faculty and approved of hearing aid usage between January 2013 and May 2013 were included in the study. Patients (21 males, 26 females; mean age 61.91±12.82; range 24 to 85 years) were performed free field audiometry with and without the device by the same audiometrist and Turkish version of the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids by the same otolaryngologist.RESULTS: Of patients, 14.28% did not obtain the hearing aid even though they received a hearing aid approval report. Assessment of the answers of inventory questions revealed that 87% of patients used hearing aid more than four hours a day, 72% benefited significantly from hearing aid, and 64% had no complaint or had few complaints compared to the before-hearing aid period.CONCLUSION: Using hearing aid affects daily activities of patients slightly or moderately and increases their communication skills."
"25751692","Case factors affecting hearing aid recommendations by hearing care professionals.","BACKGROUND: Professional recommendations to patients concerning hearing instrument (HI) technology levels are not currently evidence-based. Pre-fitting parameters have not been proven to be the primary indicators for optimal patient outcome with different HI technology levels. This results in subjective decision-making as regards the technology level recommendation made by professionals.PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to gain insight into the decision-making criteria utilized by professionals when recommending HI technology levels to hearing-impaired patients.RESEARCH DESIGN: A set of patient variables (and their respective levels) was identified by professionals as determinant for their recommendation of HIs. An experimental design was developed and 21 representative patient cases were generated. The design was based on a contrastive vignette technique according to which different types of vignettes (patient cases) were randomly presented to respondents in an online survey. Based on these patient cases, professionals were asked in the survey to make a treatment recommendation.STUDY SAMPLE: The online survey was sent to approximately 3,500 professionals from the US, Germany, France, and Italy. The professionals were randomly selected from the databases of Oticon sales companies. The manufacturer sponsoring the survey remained anonymous and was only revealed after completing the survey, if requested by the respondent. The response rate was 20.5%.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data comprised of respondent descriptions and patient case recommendations that were collected from the online survey. A binary logit modeling approach was used to identify the variables that discriminate between the respondents' recommendations of HI technology levels.RESULTS: The results show that HI technology levels are recommended by professionals based on their perception of the patient's activity level in life, the level of HI usage for experienced users, their age, and their speech discrimination score. Surprisingly, the patient's lifestyle as perceived by the hearing care professional, followed by speech discrimination, were the strongest factors in explaining treatment recommendation. An active patient with poor speech discrimination had a 17% chance of being recommended the highest technology level HI. For a very active patient with good speech discrimination, the probability increases to 68%.CONCLUSIONS: The discrepancies in HI technology level recommendations are not justified by academic research or evidence of optimal patient outcome with a different HI technology level. The paradigm of lifestyle as the significant variable identified in this study is apparently deeply anchored in the mindset of the professional despite the lack of supporting evidence. These results call for a shift in the professional's technology level recommendation practice, from nonevidence-based to a proven practice that can maximize patient outcome."
"25634777","Hearing aid and hearing assistance technology use in Aotearoa/New Zealand.","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe factors that are related to hearing aid and hearing assistance technology ownership and use in Aotearoa/New Zealand.DESIGN: Adults with hearing impairment living in New Zealand were surveyed regarding health-related quality of life and device usage. Audiometric data (hearing sensitivity and speech in noise) were collected.STUDY SAMPLE: Data were obtained from 123 adults with hearing impairment: 73 reported current hearing-aid use, 81 reported current hearing assistance technology use.RESULTS: In both analyses, device users had more difficulty understanding speech in background noise, had poor hearing in both their better and worse hearing ears, and perceived more consequences of hearing impairment in their everyday lives (both emotionally and socially) than non-hearing-aid users. Discriminant analyses showed that the social consequences of hearing impairment and the better ear hearing best classified hearing aid users from non-users but social consequences and worse ear hearing best classified hearing assistance technology users from non-users.CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life measurements and speech-in-noise assessments provide useful clinical information. Hearing-impaired adults in New Zealand who use hearing aids also tend to use hearing assistance technology, which has important clinical implications."
"27094053","Satisfaction and compliance of adult patients using hearing aid and evaluation of factors affecting them.","The aims of this study are to reveal patient compliance and satisfaction in hearing aid-prescribed adult population and to determine the relevant clinical factors. The study was designed retrospectively, and those patients who have been using hearing aid for at least 6 months were invited for evaluation. Demographical data, hearing aid type (digital vs analog), general satisfaction, and daily usage time were asked. Then, the Hearing Aid Satisfaction Questionnaire (HASQ) was applied to all patients which included visual analog scale (VAS)-based 10 questions about the effects of hearing aid on social communication, efficiency, cosmetics, life quality and cost. Totally 400 patients were included in the study. The HASQ was confirmed to be highly reliable by &quot;Kaiser Meyer Olkin and Bartlett Sphericity&quot; tests after exclusion of aid-cost question. There was a negative correlation between age and satisfaction, and a positive correlation between hearing aid usage time (years) and satisfaction (p &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference between mean HASQ scores regarding gender, employment status, hearing aid type and the site of hearing aid wearing. HASQ scores were significantly worse in pure sensorineural loss type, lower educational status, shorter daily usage time, but better in higher pure tone threshold levels (p &lt; 0.05). Age, time of hearing aid usage daily, type of hearing impairment, the threshold of hearing and education were the factors affecting satisfaction. Regular daily usage of hearing aid should be encouraged in patients, since by this way aid usage and satisfaction may be improved."
"28906244","Hearing Aid Use and Mild Hearing Impairment: Learnings from Big Data.","BACKGROUND: Previous research, mostly reliant on self-reports, has indicated that hearing aid (HA) use is related to the degree of hearing impairment (HI). No large-scale investigation of the relationship between data-logged HA use and HI has been conducted to date.PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate if objective measures of overall daily HA use and HA use in various listening environments are different for adults with mild HI compared to adults with moderate HI.RESEARCH DESIGN: This retrospective study used data extracted from a database of fitting appointments from an international group of HA providers. Only data from the participants' most recent fitting appointment were included in the final dataset.STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 8,489 bilateral HA fittings of adults over the age of 18 yr, conducted between January 2013 and June 2014, were included. Participants were subsequently allocated to HI groups, based on British Society of Audiology and American Speech-Language-Hearing Association audiometric descriptors.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Fitting data from participating HA providers were regularly transferred to a central server. The data, with all personal information except age and gender removed, contained participants' four-frequency average (at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz) as well as information on HA characteristics and usage. Following data cleaning, bivariate and post hoc statistical analyses were conducted.RESULTS: The total sample of adults' average daily HA use was 8.52 hr (interquartile range [IQR] = 5.49-11.77) in the left ear and 8.51 hr (IQR = 5.49-11.72) in the right ear. With a few exceptions, there were no statistical differences between hours of HA use for participants with mild HI compared to those with moderate impairment. Across all mild and moderate HI groups, the most common overall HA usage was between 8 and 12 hr per day. Other factors such as age, gender, and HA style also showed no relationship to hours of use. HAs were used, on average, for 7 hr (IQR = 4.27-9.96) per day in quiet and 1 hr (IQR = 0.33-1.41) per day in noisy listening situations.CONCLUSIONS: Clinical populations with mild HI use HAs as frequently as those with a moderate HI. These findings support the recommendation of HAs for adults with milder degrees of HI."

"29587086","Longitudinal Tracking of Sound Exposure and Hearing Aid Usage through Objective Data Logs.","Objective To use data-logging technology to objectively track and identify predictors of hearing aid (HA) usage and aided sound exposure. Study Design Case series with planned data collection. Setting Tertiary academic medical center. Subjects and Methods Individuals with HAs between 2007 and 2016 were included (N = 431; mean, 74.6 years; 95% CI, 73.1-76.0). Data-logging technology intrinsic to new-generation HAs was enabled to track usage and sound exposure. With multivariable linear regression, age, sex, number of audiology visits, duration of audiologic follow-up, pure tone average, and HA side were assessed as predictors of usage (hours/day) and aided sound exposure (dB-hours/day; ie, &quot;dose&quot; of sound per day). Results Mean follow-up was 319 days (95% CI, 277-360). Mean HA usage was 8.4 hours/day (95% CI, 8.0-8.8; N = 431). Mean aided sound exposure was 440 dB-hours/day (95% CI, 385-493; n = 110). HA use (ß &lt; 0.001, P = .45) and aided sound exposure (ß = -0.006, P = .87) were both stable over time. HA usage was associated only with hearing loss level (pure tone average; ß = 0.030, P = .04). Aided sound exposure was associated only with duration of audiologic follow-up (ß = 0.100, P = .02). Conclusion While measurement of HA use has traditionally relied on subjective reporting, data logging offers an objective tool to longitudinally track HA use and sound exposure. We demonstrate the feasibility of using this potentially powerful research tool. Usage and sound exposure were stable among patients throughout the study period. Use was greater among subjects with greater hearing loss. Maximizing aided sound exposure might be possible through continued audiology follow-up visits."
"29475977","Risk factors for falls among older community dwellers in Shenzhen, China.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of falls reported by older community dwellers in Shenzhen, China and to identify fall-related risk factors.METHOD: Participants were community dwellers residing in Shenzhen, China, who were aged 60 years and over and were recruited using multistage random sampling. All participants were surveyed about demographic and health-related information, mood, vision and hearing impairment, self-rated health and retrospective falls, and a test of balance was administered. Univariate and multivariate negative binomial regression was used to identify factors associated with a greater number of falls.RESULT: Study participants were 1290 people aged 60-98 years (mean 68.2 years, SD ±6.5). One hundred and seventy-seven falls were reported. One hundred and eleven (8.6%) participants reported one fall in the past year, 17 (1.3%) participants reported two falls and 10 (0.8%) participants reported three or more falls. Univariate analysis showed that age, living alone, presence of a medical condition, medication usage, visual impairment, poor subjective body sense perception, low mood, poor self-rated health and poor balance were associated with a greater number of falls in the past year. Multivariate analysis identified presence of a medical condition (incidence rate ratio (IRR)=1.40, 95%<U+2009>CI 1.19 to 1.67), living alone (IRR=2.46, 95%<U+2009>CI 1.12 to 5.41), visual impairment (IRR=1.46, 95%<U+2009>CI 1.03 to 2.08), walking aid use (IRR=2.29, 95%<U+2009>CI 1.12 to 4.69) and impaired balance (IRR=1.05, 95%<U+2009>CI 1.00 to 1.10) to be significantly associated with a greater number of falls in the past year.CONCLUSION: More falls occurred in older Chinese people with presence of a medical condition, living alone, visual impairment, used a walking aid and impaired balance."
"29304553","Hearing impairment and hearing aid usage in Singapore.","OBJECTIVE: To examine the epidemiological and audiological profile, pattern of hearing aid (HA) fitting and usage among HA users in Singapore.DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study.STUDY SAMPLE: Cohort of 1068 subjects issued with HAs at a tertiary hospital between 2001 and 2013.RESULTS: Mean age was 70<U+2009>years with 50.8% male. Mean hearing loss (HL) was 63.1<U+2009>dB and 69.5% had at least moderate-severe HL. Sensorineural HL was present in 66.4% and 69.8% had symmetrical HL. &quot;Behind-the-Ear&quot; HAs were cheaper than &quot;In-Ear&quot; HAs. Standard &quot;Behind-The-Ear&quot; HAs were also cheaper than &quot;Receiver-in-Canal&quot; HAs. Among In-Ear HAs, &quot;In-the-Canal&quot; and &quot;Completely-in-Canal&quot; were more popular than &quot;In-the-Ear&quot; HAs despite costing more. HA was used =4<U+2009>days/week by 85.6% but &gt;7<U+2009>h per day by only 35.7%. Only 18% received bilateral first HA fitting. In multivariate analysis, younger age and symmetrical HL were predictors of bilateral HA uptake while better Pure-Tone-Audiometry of aided ear and &gt;7<U+2009>h of daily HA usage were predictors of successive HA fitting.CONCLUSIONS: HA users in Singapore were elderly and presented with advanced HL. Bilateral HA adoption and average daily use were low compared to other developed countries. Future research on understanding the suboptimal HA usage should explore patients' motivation, hearing disability, and HA effectiveness."
