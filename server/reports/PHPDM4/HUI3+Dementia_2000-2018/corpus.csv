"11059474","A comparison of HUI2 and HUI3 utility scores in Alzheimer's disease.","PURPOSE: The Health Utilities Index (HUI) is a generic, multiattribute, preference-based health-status classification system. The HUI Mark 3 (HUI3) differs from the earlier HUI2 by modifying attributes and allowing more flexibility for capturing high levels of impairment. The authors compared HUI2 and HUI3 scores of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and caregivers, and contrasted results of a cost-effectiveness analysis of new drugs for AD using the two systems.METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of 679 AD patient/caregiver pairs, stratified by patient's disease stage (questionable/mild/moderate/severe/profound/terminal) and setting (community/assisted living/nursing home), caregivers completed the combined HUI2/HUI3 questionnaire as proxy respondents for patients and for themselves.RESULTS: Mean (SD) global utility scores for patients were lower on the HUI3 (0.22[0.26]) than on the HUI2 (0.53 [0.21]). Patient HUI3 utility scores ranged from 0.47(0.24) for questionable AD to -0.23 (0.08) for terminal AD, compared with a range of 0.73 (0.15) to 0.14 (0.07) for the HUI2. Among the 203 patients in the severe, profound, and terminal stages, 96 (48%) had negative global HUI3 utility scores, while none had a negative HUI2 score. The utility scores for caregivers were similar on the HUI3 (0.87 [0.14]) and HUI2 (0.87 [0.11]). Cost-effectiveness analysis of a new medication to treat AD showed somewhat more favorable results using the HUI3.CONCLUSIONS: The HUI2 and HUI3 discriminate well across AD stages. Compared with the HUI2, the HUI3 yields lower global utility scores for patients with AD, and more scores for states judged worse than dead. The HUI3 may yield substantially different results from the HUI2, particularly for persons who have serious cognitive impairments such as AD."
"17146727","Measuring patient quality of life: is the health utility index useful?","The purpose of this paper is to report Health Utility Index Mark 3 (HUI3) scores, at baseline and at one year, for patients with psychotic disorders. Eighty two randomly selected outpatients from a Montreal teaching hospital completed the HUI3 and other measures of symptoms and side-effects. At baseline, the average Global Utility score was 0.64, which is rated in the &quot;dysfunctional&quot; health status range. Improvements were seen at one year follow-up in the Global, Dexterity, Cognition, and Pain Utility scores. The proportion of individuals rated in the &quot;healthy&quot; health status range improved by 32% from baseline to one year. HUI3 scores were negatively related to measures of psychotic symptoms and side-effects. We propose that the HUI3 should be used to assess health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with psychotic disorders. Scores could be compared with other populations affected with chronic conditions (e.g., Alzheimer dementia, cancer, arthritis, etc.)."

Test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients) and convergent validity (Spearman correlations) of utility scores with global health status, activities of daily living, comorbidity, mood, cognition and other utility measures were assessed.RESULTS: Completion time was shortest for the combined EQ-5D and VAS. For patients with mild dementia and for proxies, reliability was &gt;or= 0.70 for the EQ-5D, QWB and HUI3. The EQ-5D had a ceiling effect for patient ratings. Convergent validity was demonstrated for patient and proxy ratings, with the strongest validity for EQ-5D ratings and the weakest validity for HUI3 patient ratings. Mean patient utility scores were significantly higher than mean proxy scores for all measures (p&lt;0.001).CONCLUSIONS: For patient and proxy ratings, the EQ-5D had the best combination of measurement properties, although it had a substantial ceiling effect for patient ratings. Proxy QOL ratings did not accurately reflect patients' ratings."
"18359192","Health Utilities Index Mark 3 showed valid in Alzheimer disease, arthritis, and cataracts.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the cross-sectional construct validity of the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) in Alzheimer disease (AD), arthritis (AR), and cataracts (CA).STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The 1996-97 Canadian National Population Health Survey for community and institution-dwelling respondents aged 40 years and above was used in the study. Adjusted means for overall and single-attribute HUI3 scores of five subgroups were compared: (1) AD only, (2) AR only, (3) CA only, (4) at least two of the three conditions, and (5) none of the three (reference group). Regression analyses were conducted for community and institutional data to obtain adjusted mean utility scores.RESULTS: Of the 76 a priori hypotheses, 55 were confirmed. HUI3 was able to describe overall burdens of AD, AR, and CA as well as vision problems associated with CA, speech and cognition problems associated with AD, and ambulation and pain problems associated with AR. Adjusted mean differences in overall HUI3 scores between AD, AR, or CA only groups and reference group ranged from -0.04 to -0.42 (P&lt;0.05); all differences were quantitatively important.CONCLUSION: HUI3 is useful in assessing the health-related quality of life of AD, AR, and CA of those living in the community and institutions."

Responsiveness was estimated using effect size (ES) statistics for behavior scale change (unchanged, small, medium, large change) and for residential status change (home to skilled nursing facility), as a global external change criterion.RESULTS: The HUI2 and HUI3 were responsive to behavioral worsening (multiattribute ES range: -0.48 to -0.78) and global decline (multiattribute ES range: -0.50 to -0.76), but not improvement. The HUI2 was more responsive than the HUI3. Correlations with the Blessed Dementia Rating Scale (r = -0.69 with both HUI2 and HUI3 multiattribute scores) and behavior scale (r = 0.44 and 0.41, respectively, for HUI2 and HUI3 multiattribute scores) supported the validity of the HUI in patients with dementia.CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the construct validity of the proxy-rated HUI2/3 in patients with moderate to severe dementia, but responsiveness results were mixed. Further studies are needed of the HUI2/3's validity, including responsiveness, in patients across the full range of dementia severity, using both self and proxy report, with particular attention to the impact of general population preference weights. When possible, multiple HRQOL measures need to be used to confirm the robustness of the findings. The proxy-rated HUI should be used in patients with moderate to severe dementia, but the self-rated HUI may be appropriate for subjects with milder cognitive impairment."
