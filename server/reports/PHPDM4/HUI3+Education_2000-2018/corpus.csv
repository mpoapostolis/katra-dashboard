"14583690","Mapping the SF-12 to preference-based instruments: convergent validity in a low-income, minority population.","BACKGROUND: The profile-based SF-12 has a low respondent burden and is used widely in clinical settings to monitor health and evaluate programs. Deriving preference scores for the SF-12 health profile would permit its use in cost-effectiveness analyses. Previous mapping studies of SF family instruments to preference-based instruments have not examined convergent validity or performance in low-income, minority populations.OBJECTIVES: To map the SF-12 to the EuroQol (EQ-5D Index) and the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) in a low-income, predominantly minority sample.RESEARCH DESIGN: We used a cross-sectional survey data.SUBJECTS: We studied a convenience sample of 240 low-income, predominantly Latino and black patients attending a community health center in New York.MEASURES: We used separate regressions of the EQ-5D Index and HUI3 onto the physical (PCS-12) and mental (MCS-12) components of the SF-12 scores as measures.RESULTS: For the EQ-5D Index regression, the adjusted variance explained was 58% (bootstrap validation 95% confidence interval [CI], 46-66). For the HUI3 regression, the adjusted variance explained was 51% (bootstrap 95% CI, 39-59). The correlation coefficient between the 2 predicted measures was 0.96. The correlation of the predicted HUI3 with the EQ-5D Index (0.73) and the predicted EQ-5D Index with the HUI3 (0.70) exceeded that between the 2 original preference-based measures themselves (0.69).CONCLUSIONS: These pilot results suggest that the SF-12 could be successfully mapped to both the EQ-5D Index and HUI3, yielding preference-based scores that demonstrate convergent validity in a low-income, minority sample."
"14530198","Health-related quality of life is better for cardiac arrest survivors who received citizen cardiopulmonary resuscitation.","BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the prehospital factors associated with better health-related quality of life for survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective, 20-community, cohort study involved consecutive, adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients who survived to 1 year. Patients were contacted by telephone and evaluated for the Health Utilities Index Mark III (HUI3), which describes health as a utility score on a scale from 0 (dead) to 1.0 (perfect health). The 8091 cardiac arrest patients had overall survival rates of 5.2% to hospital discharge and 4.0% to 1 year. We successfully contacted and evaluated 268 of 316 (84.8%) of known 1-year survivors. The median HUI3 score was 0.80 (interquartile range, 0.50 to 0.97), which compares well with age-adjusted values for the general population (0.83). Logistic regression identified 2 factors independently associated with very good quality of life (HUI3 &gt;0.90) and their odds ratios (95% CIs), as follows: age 80 years or older, 0.3 (0.1 to 0.84), and citizen-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), 2.0 (1.2 to 3.4) (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic, 0.74).CONCLUSIONS: This study is the largest ever conducted for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors, clearly shows that these patients have good quality of life, and is the first to demonstrate that citizen-initiated CPR is strongly and independently associated with better quality of life. These results emphasize the importance of optimizing community citizen CPR readiness. Given the low rate of citizen-initiated CPR in many communities, we believe that local and national initiatives should vigorously promote the practice of bystander CPR."
"12835603","Variation in the estimation of quality-adjusted life-years by different preference-based instruments.","OBJECTIVES: To assess the interchangeability of preference-based health-related quality of life tools and compare the potential gains in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in patients with musculoskeletal disease.METHODS: Consecutive patients visiting a rheumatology clinic completed health-related quality of life assessments at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months with the EuroQol (EQ-5D), Health Utilities Index (HUI3), and Short-Form 6D (SF-6D). Patients rated their health changes retrospectively and responses were categorized into three groups: better, same, and worse. Correlations and repeated measures analysis of variance with post hoc contrasts and a Bonferroni correction were used to assess interchangeability of tools.RESULTS: Results were based on 161 cases with complete baseline data and 98 cases with data at baseline and 12 months. Correlations ranged from 0.66 to 0.79. An interaction effect showed that for the better group, the EQ-5D showed a significantly greater mean improvement (0.15) than the HUI3 (0.07) or the SF-6D (0.05). For the worse group, the EQ-5D showed a significantly greater mean decrease (0.19) than either the HUI3 (0.05) or the SF-6D (0.03). QALYs differences between the better and worse groups were significantly greater (0.23) with the EQ-5D than with the HUI3 (0.11) or the SF-6D (0.09).CONCLUSIONS: Although results moderately support the idea that the three tools are measuring a similar underlying construct, the tools are not interchangeable because they are scaled differently and produce varying results. These findings have potential implications for the interpretation and comparability of health outcome studies and economic analyses. Possible approaches are sensitivity analysis or standardization of scores before calculation of QALYs."
"15556237","Cut-point shift and index shift in self-reported health.","There is some concern that ordered responses on health questions may differ across populations or even across subgroups of a population. This reporting heterogeneity may invalidate group comparisons and measures of health inequality. This paper proposes a test for differential reporting in ordered response models which enables to distinguish between cut-point shift and index shift. The method is illustrated using Canadian National Population Health Survey data. The McMaster Health Utility Index Mark 3 (HUI3) is used as a more objective health measure than the simple five-point scale of self-assessed health. We find clear evidence of index shifting and cut-point shifting for age and gender, but not for income, education or language."
"15292531","The impact of low family income on self-reported health outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis within a publicly funded health-care environment.","OBJECTIVE: Self-rated health (SRH) is an independent, strong predictor of morbidity and mortality. Socio-economic status (SES) is strongly associated with SRH. This study investigated the relationship between SES and SRH outcomes in a sample of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Canada.METHODS: Both generic preference-based [Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) and Short Form 6D (SF-6D)] and non-preference-based [disease-specific (Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life, RAQoL) and a functional status (Health Assessment Questionnaire, HAQ)] SRH questionnaires were administered to 313 RA patients. Both proximate (education and annual household income) and contextual (neighbourhood income, education and unemployment) measures of SES were captured. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression was used to adjust for RA severity while assessing the relationship between SRH and SES measures. Two-stage least-squares (TSLS) regression was used to determine if there was an inter-relationship between SES and SRH measures.RESULTS: The sample was well distributed across RA severity and SES measures. Contextual and proximate measures of SES were poorly correlated. Lower levels of proximate SES measures (but not contextual) were associated with poorer SRH outcomes. The OLS regressions showed significant associations between the HUI3 and the SF-6D overall scores and the HAQ for self-reported income. The RAQoL did not differ significantly across SES. TSLS regression confirmed the finding that self-reported income was similarly associated with the SRH measures.CONCLUSIONS: Even in a country with universal access to health-care, the impact of a chronic disease such as RA on SRH is associated with self-reported income. The finding that preference-based measures vary with income independently of RA severity could bias economic evaluation."
"16224300","Self-reported health status of the general adult U.S. population as assessed by the EQ-5D and Health Utilities Index.","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the self-reported health status of the general adult U.S. population using 3 multi-attribute preference-based measures: the EQ-5D, Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI2), and Mark 3 (HUI3).METHODS: We surveyed the general adult U.S. population using a probability sample with oversampling of Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks. Respondents to this home-visit survey self-completed the EQ-5D and HUI2/3 questionnaires. Overall health index scores of the target population and selected subgroups were estimated and construct validity of these measures was assessed by testing a priori hypotheses.RESULTS: Completed questionnaires were collected from 4048 respondents (response rate: 59.4%). The majority of the respondents were women (52.0%); the mean age of the sample was 45 years, with 14.8% being 65 or older. Index scores (standard errors) for the general adult U.S. population as assessed by the EQ-5D, HUI2, and HUI3 were 0.87 (0.01), 0.86 (0.01), and 0.81 (0.01), respectively. Generally, younger, male and Hispanic or non-Hispanic black adults had higher (better) index scores than older, female and other racial/ethnic adults; index scores were higher with higher educational attainment and household income. The 3 overall preference indices were strongly correlated (Pearson's r: 0.67-0.87), but systematically different, with intraclass correlation coefficients between these indices ranging from 0.59 to 0.77.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides U.S. population norms for self-reported health status on the EQ-5D, HUI2, and HUI3. Although these measures appeared to be valid and demonstrated similarities, health status assessed by these measures is not exactly the same."
"16967751","Aboriginal participation in the DOVE study.","BACKGROUND: Aboriginals constitute a substantial portion of the population of Northern Alberta. Determinants such as poverty and education can compound health-care accessibility barriers experienced by Aboriginals compared to non-Aboriginals. A diabetes care enhancement study involved the collection of baseline and follow-up data on Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients with known type 2 diabetes in two rural communities in Northern Alberta. Analyses were conducted to determine any demographic or clinical differences existing between Aboriginals and non-Aboriginals.METHODS: 394 diabetes patients were recruited from the Peace and Keeweetinok Lakes health regions. 354 self-reported whether or not they were Aboriginal; a total of 94 self-reported being Aboriginal. Baseline and follow-up data were collected through interviews, standardized physical assessments, laboratory testing and self-reporting questionnaires (RAND-12 and HUI3).RESULTS: Aboriginals were younger, with longer duration of diabetes, more likely to be female, and less likely to have completed high school. At baseline, self-reported health status was uniformly worse, but the differences disappeared with adjustments for sociodemographic confounders, except for perceived mental health status. Aboriginals considered their mental health status to be worse than non-Aboriginals at baseline. Some aspects of health utilization were also different.DISCUSSION: While demographics were different and some utilization differences existed, overall this analysis demonstrates that &quot;Aboriginality&quot; does not contribute to diabetes outcomes when adjusted for appropriate variables."
"17939874","Comparing the health of low income and less well educated groups in the United States and Canada.","BACKGROUND: A limited number of health status and health-related quality of life (HRQL) measures have been used for inter-country comparisons of population health. We compared the health of Canadians and Americans using a preference-based measure.METHODS: The Joint Canada/United States Survey of Health (JCUSH) 2002-03 conducted a comprehensive cross-sectional telephone survey on the health of community-dwelling residents in Canada and the US (n = 8688). A preference-based measure, the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3), was included in the JCUSH. Health status was analyzed for the entire population and white population only in both countries. Mean HUI3 overall scores were compared for both countries. A linear regression determinants of health model was estimated to account for differences in health between Canada and the US. Estimation with bootstraps was used to derive variance estimates that account for the survey's complex sampling design of clustering and stratification.RESULTS: Income is associated with health in both countries. In the lowest income quintile, Canadians are healthier than Americans. At lower levels of education, again Canadians are healthier than Americans. Differences in health among subjects in the JCUSH are explained by age, gender, education, income, marital status, and country of residence.CONCLUSION: On average, population health in Canada and the US is similar. However, health disparities between Canadians and Americans exist at lower levels of education and income with Americans worse off. The results highlight the usefulness of continuous preference-based measures of population health such as the HUI3."
"17888214","Computerized administration of health-related quality of life instruments compared to interviewer administration may reduce sample size requirements in clinical research: a pilot randomized controlled trial among rheumatology patients.","OBJECTIVES: Computerized health-related quality of life (HRQoL) administration may facilitate clinical trials incorporating HRQoL assessment in rheumatology patients by reducing sample size requirements. We tested this hypothesis in a pilot randomized controlled trial.METHODS: Chinese-speaking adult rheumatology outpatients were randomized to computerized (PC) or interviewer (IA) administration of the EQ-5D (utility &amp; VAS), Health Utilities Index (HUI2 &amp; HUI3) and Family Functioning Measure (FFM). We compared measurement variability (i.e., variance) between PC and IA for each instrument before (Levene's test) and after adjusting for the effects of age, gender and education (multivariable modeling) and computed the variance ratio (VR) for PC over IA.RESULTS: In 138 patients (mean age: 48), the mean (SD) time for administration was similar for PC (n = 67) and IA (n = 71) at 17.7 (7.94) versus 17.3 minutes (7.49), respectively. More subjects expressed a preference for PC (n = 21) over IA (n = 13). Mean HRQoL scores were not significantly different for PC versus IA except for higher VAS scores with IA (difference -7.7, 95% CI -14.0 to 1.3, p = 0.018). Variances and adjusted VR were smaller with PC for the EQ-5D (adjusted VR 0.34, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.65), HUI3 (0.49, 0.27 to 0.89) and FFM (0.95, 0.61 to 1.46), but larger for the HUI2 (1.30, 0.67 to 2.55) and VAS (1.05, 0.55 to 2.00).CONCLUSION: The reduced variability in 3 of 5 instruments and good acceptance of computerized HRQoL assessment, if confirmed in larger studies, may lead to smaller sample size requirements, with potential reductions in cost and recruitment time for clinical trials and cohort studies."
"19067006","Importance of sociodemographic and morbidity aspects in measuring health-related quality of life: performances of three tools: comparison of three questionnaire scores.","BACKGROUND: Since health-related quality of life (HRQL) measures are numerous, comparisons have been suggested.AIM: To compare three HRQL measures: SF6D, HUI3 and EQ5D.METHODS: Three questionnaires (SF36, HUI3, EQ5D) were administered to 1,011 patients attending 16 general practices in two Italian cities. Information about patients' gender, age, education, marital status, smoking, body mass index (BMI) and chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal diseases) were also collected. Questionnaires scores were calculated using the appropriate algorithms; in particular SF6D scores were obtained from SF36 items. Agreement and correlation between questionnaires scores were investigated using Bland and Altman method and Spearman coefficient. The influence of socio-demographic and morbidity indicators on scores was analysed using the nonparametric quantile regression.RESULTS: The Spearman coefficient was about 0.6 for all questionnaires. The 95% limits of agreement of the scores were approximately from -0.5 to 0.3 except for SF6D and EQ5D when they were from -0.4 to 0.2. The measures were influenced by socio-demographic and clinical variables in a similar way, especially SF6D (the index obtained from SF36) and EQ5D, which appeared to be influenced by the same pattern of factors, including gender, chronic diseases, smoking and BMI.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the agreement between questionnaires scores was quite low, whilst the correlation level was good. Questionnaire scores were influenced by socio-demographic and clinical variables in a similar way, especially SF6D and EQ5D. Therefore, the descriptive capacity of SF6D and EQ5D was found to be similar."
"19527920","Do the determinants of health differ between people living in the community and in institutions?","Determinants of health studies have mainly dealt with samples of community-dwelling subjects. We utilized the 1996/97 Canadian National Population Health Survey community and institutional surveys to identify factors associated with the selection of individuals to institutions. We also assessed whether the same determinants of health variables explain variations in health in those living in the community and those living in institutions. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate factors associated with selection to institutions. Results showed that health status, age, chronic conditions, education, race, marital status, smoking and alcohol were associated with the probability of being in an institution. Multiple linear regression analyses (dependent variable: Health Utilities Index Mark 3 [HUI3] score) with individual characteristics, socio-economic status, and health risk factors were also estimated. Results showed that advanced age, higher number of chronic conditions, lower education, smoking and being an alcohol non-drinker were negatively and significantly associated with HUI3 scores for the community sample. Except for age, chronic conditions and being an alcohol non-drinker, none of these factors were significantly associated with HUI3 for the institutional sample. Moreover, the association between age and HUI3 was weaker for the institutional sample in comparison to the community sample. Implications are that, for those who are institutionalized, the usual determinants of health factors are less important. In conclusion, there appears to be important heterogeneity in determinants of health between persons living in the institution and community."
"19473334","Effects of mode and order of administration on generic health-related quality of life scores.","OBJECTIVE: We evaluate the effects of mode and order of administration on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) scores.METHOD: We analyzed HRQOL data from the Clinical Outcomes and Measurement of Health Study (COMHS). In COMHS, we enrolled patients with heart failure or cataracts at three sites (University of California, San Diego, University of California, Los Angeles, and University of Wisconsin). Patients completed self-administered HRQOL instruments at baseline and months 1 and 6 post-baseline, including the EuroQol (EQ-5D), Health Utilities Index (HUI), Quality of Well-Being Scale--self-administered (QWB-SA), and the Short Form (SF)-36v2. At the 6 months follow-up, individuals were randomized to mail or telephone administration first, followed by the other mode of administration. We used repeated measures mixed effects models, adjusting for site, patient age, education, gender, and race.RESULTS: Included were 121 individuals entering a heart failure program and 326 individuals scheduled for cataract surgery who completed the survey by mail or phone at the 6-month follow-up. The majority of the sample was female (53%) and white (86%). About a quarter of the sample had high school education or less (26%). The average age was 66 (36-91 range). HRQOL scores were higher (more positive) for phone administration following mail administration. The largest differences in scores between phone and mail responses occurred for comparisons of telephone responses for those who were randomized to a mail survey first compared with mail responses for those randomized to a telephone survey first (i.e., mode effects for responses that were given on the second administration of the HRQOL measures). The QWB-SA was the only measure that did not display the pattern of mode effects. The biggest differences between modes were 4 points on the SF-36v2 physical health and mental health component summary scores, 0.06 on the SF-6D, 0.03 on the QWB-SA, 0.08 on the EQ-5D, 0.04 on the HUI2, and 0.10 on the HUI3.CONCLUSIONS: Telephone administration yields significantly more positive HRQOL scores for all of the generic HRQOL measures except for the QWB-SA. The magnitude of effects was clearly important, with some differences as large as a half-standard deviation. These findings confirm the importance of considering mode of administration when interpreting HRQOL scores."
"20496168","Gender differences in health-related quality-of-life are partly explained by sociodemographic and socioeconomic variation between adult men and women in the US: evidence from four US nationally representative data sets.","PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe gender differences in self-reported health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) and to examine whether differences are explained by sociodemographic and socioeconomic status (SES) differentials between men and women.METHODS: Data were from four US nationally representative surveys: US Valuation of the EuroQol EQ-5D Health States Survey (USVEQ), Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), National Health Measurement Study (NHMS) and Joint Canada/US Survey of Health (JCUSH). Gender differences were estimated with and without adjustment for sociodemographic and SES indicators using regression within and across data sets with SF-6D, EQ-5D, HUI2, HUI3 and QWB-SA scores as outcomes.RESULTS: Women have lower HRQoL scores than men on all indexes prior to adjustment. Adjusting for age, race, marital status, education and income reduced but did not remove the gender differences, except with HUI3. Adjusting for marital status or income had the largest impact on estimated gender differences.CONCLUSIONS: There are clear gender differences in HRQoL in the United States. These differences are partly explained by sociodemographic and SES differentials."
"20429875","Comparing population health in the United States and Canada.","BACKGROUND: The objective of the paper is to compare population health in the United States (US) and Canada. Although the two countries are very similar in many ways, there are potentially important differences in the levels of social and economic inequality and the organization and financing of and access to health care in the two countries.METHODS: Data are from the Joint Canada/United States Survey of Health 2002/03. The Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) was used to measure overall health-related quality of life (HRQL). Mean HUI3 scores were compared, adjusting for major determinants of health, including body mass index, smoking, education, gender, race, and income. In addition, estimates of life expectancy were compared. Finally, mean HUI3 scores by age and gender and Canadian and US life tables were used to estimate health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE).RESULTS: Life expectancy in Canada is higher than in the US. For those &lt; 40 years, there were no differences in HRQL between the US and Canada. For the 40+ group, HRQL appears to be higher in Canada. The results comparing the white-only population in both countries were very similar. For a 19-year-old, HALE was 52.0 years in Canada and 49.3 in the US.CONCLUSIONS: The population of Canada appears to be substantially healthier than the US population with respect to life expectancy, HRQL, and HALE. Factors that account for the difference may include access to health care over the full life span (universal health insurance) and lower levels of social and economic inequality, especially among the elderly."
"21461953","Comparison and correlates of three preference-based health-related quality-of-life measures among overweight and obese women with urinary incontinence.","PURPOSE: To compare three preference-based health-related quality-of-life (HRQL) measures and examine independent correlates of HRQL among overweight and obese women with urinary incontinence (UI) enrolled in a weight loss intervention trial.METHODS: Participants completed baseline questionnaires, which included the Health Utilities Index 3 (HUI3) and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36). The SF-36 was used to derive SF-6D and estimated Quality of Well-Being (eQWB) scores. Height, weight, medical history, incontinence measures, and level of physical activity also were assessed. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was computed, and differences in mean scores across HRQL measures were examined. Potential correlates of HUI3, SF-6D, and eQWB scores were evaluated using multivariable generalized linear models.RESULTS: Mean ± SD scores for the HUI3, SF-6D, and eQWB were 0.81 ± 0.18, 0.75 ± 0.10, and 0.71 ± 0.06, respectively. Significant differences were observed across measures (P &lt; 0.0001), and the overall ICC was 0.36. In multivariable analyses, BMI was negatively associated with HUI3 (P = 0.003) and eQWB (P &lt; 0.001), and UI episode frequency was negatively associated with eQWB (P = 0.015) and SF-6D (P &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in mean utilities across the HUI3, SF-6D, and eQWB indicate that these measures do not assess identical dimensions of HRQL. Both BMI and UI episode frequency were related to HRQL in this cohort; however, the magnitude of the relationship depended on the preference-based measure used. These findings highlight the need to consider the method used to generate HRQL values for calculating quality-adjusted life-years in cost-utility analyses, since choice of method may have a substantial impact on the outcome of the analysis."
"22941670","Interpersonal discrimination and health-related quality of life among black and white men and women in the United States.","OBJECTIVE: We assessed associations between discrimination and health-related quality of life among black and white men and women in the United States.METHODS: We examined data from the National Health Measurement Study, a nationally representative sample of 3,648 adults aged 35-89 in the non-institutionalized US population. These data include self-reported lifetime and everyday discrimination as well as several health utility indexes (EQ-5D, HUI3, and SF-6D). Multiple regression was used to compute mean health utility scores adjusted for age, income, education, and chronic diseases for each race-by-gender subgroup.RESULTS: Black men and women reported more discrimination compared to white men and women. Health utility tended to be worse as reported discrimination increased. With a few exceptions, differences between mean health utility scores in the lowest and highest discrimination groups exceeded the 0.03 difference generally considered to be a clinically significant difference.CONCLUSIONS: Persons who experienced discrimination tended to score lower on health utility measures. The study also revealed a complex relationship between experiences of discrimination and race and gender. Because of these differential social and demographic relationships caution is urged when interpreting self-rated health measures in research, clinical, and policy settings."
"22930542","Pharmacist-initiated intervention trial in osteoarthritis: a multidisciplinary intervention for knee osteoarthritis.","OBJECTIVE: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a commonly undiagnosed condition and care is often not provided. Pharmacists are uniquely placed for launching a multidisciplinary intervention for knee OA.METHODS: We performed a cluster randomized controlled trial with pharmacies providing either intervention care or usual care (14 and 18 pharmacies, respectively). The intervention included a validated knee OA screening questionnaire, education, pain medication management, physiotherapy-guided exercise, and communication with the primary care physician. Usual care consisted of an educational pamphlet. The primary outcome was the pass rate on the Arthritis Foundation's quality indicators for OA. Secondary outcomes included the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), the Lower Extremity Function Scale (LEFS), the Paper Adaptive Test-5D (PAT-5D), and the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3).RESULTS: One hundred thirty-nine patients were assigned to the control (n = 66) and intervention (n = 73) groups. There were no differences between the groups in baseline measures. The overall quality indicator pass rate was significantly higher in the intervention arm compared to the control arm (difference of 45.2%; 95% confidence interval 34.5, 55.9). Significant improvements were observed for the intervention care group as compared to the usual care group in the WOMAC global, pain, and function scores at 3 and 6 months (all P &lt; 0.01); the PAT-5D daily activity scores at 3 and 6 months (both P &lt; 0.05); the PAT-5D pain scores at 6 months (P = 0.05); the HUI3 single-attribute pain scores at 3 and 6 months (all P &lt; 0.05); and the LEFS scores at 6 months (P &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: Pharmacists can launch a multidisciplinary intervention to identify knee OA cases, improve the utilization of treatments, and improve function, pain, and quality of life."

"22309947","Gender differences in quality of life among Canadian adults with epilepsy.","The clinical literature suggests epilepsy may impact quality of life in males and females differently. Previous research on gender issues has focused primarily on biological-biomedical factors over psychological and social factors. In this study we compare subjective and objective quality of life in adult persons with epilepsy to persons without epilepsy by gender using the biopsychosocial model in the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), a large epidemiological survey that covers 98% of the Canadian population. Logistic regression analyses were conducted using self-rated health status and the Health Utility Index(®) 3 (HUI3) as the outcomes. Quality of life was significantly moderated after controlling for the biological-biomedical variables in all analyses except the HUI3. Males with epilepsy were more likely to have HUI3 scores of 0.70 or greater than males without epilepsy (OR = 1.61, 95%CI 1.32-1.96). For males with epilepsy the HUI3 was further moderated, but remained significantly better in the final model that controlled for biological, psychological and social factors (OR = 1.43, 95%CI 1.17-1.76). Our findings provide support for treatment approaches that focus on the whole person. Such approaches should take into account gender differences when examining objective quality of life."
"23565099","Recreational physical activity ameliorates some of the negative impact of major depression on health-related quality of life.","BACKGROUND: Major depressive episodes have a negative effect on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The objective of this study was to determine whether recreational physical activity can ameliorate some of this negative impact.METHODS: The data source for the study was the Canadian National Population Health Survey (NPHS). The NPHS is a longitudinal study that has collected data from a representative cohort of 15,254 community residents. Sixteen years of follow-up data are available. The NPHS included: an instrument to assess MDE (the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short Form for Major Depression), an inventory of recreational activities (each associated with hours of participation and estimated metabolic expenditures), and a HRQoL instrument (the Health Utility Index, Mark 3, or HUI3). Proportional hazard and linear regression models were used in this study to determine whether MDE-related declines in HRQoL were lessened by participation in an active recreational lifestyle.RESULTS: Consistent with expectation, major depression was associated with a significant decline in HRQoL over time. While no statistical interactions were observed, the risk of diminished HRQoL in association with MDE was reduced by physical activity. In a proportional hazards model, the hazard ratio for transition to poor HRQoL was 0.7 (95% CI: 0.6-0.8, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.0001). In linear regression models, physical activity was significantly associated with more positive HRQoL (ß<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.019, 95% CI 0.004 to -0.034, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02).CONCLUSION: Recreational physical activity appears to ameliorate some of the decline in HRQoL seen in association with MDE. Physical activity may be an effective tertiary preventive strategy for this condition."
"23306666","Erratum to: Interpersonal discrimination and health-related quality of life among black and white men and women in the United States.","OBJECTIVE: We assessed associations between discrimination and health-related quality of life among black and white men and women in the United States.METHODS: We examined data from the National Health Measurement Study, a nationally representative sample of 3,648 adults aged 35-89 in the non-institutionalized US population. These data include self-reported lifetime and everyday discrimination as well as several health utility indexes (EQ-5D, HUI3, and SF-6D). Multiple regression was used to compute mean health utility scores adjusted for age, income, education, and chronic diseases for each race-by-gender subgroup.RESULTS: Black men and women reported more discrimination than white men and women. Health utility tended to be worse as reported discrimination increased. With a few exceptions, differences between mean health utility scores in the lowest and highest discrimination groups exceeded the 0.03 difference generally considered to be a clinically significant difference.CONCLUSIONS: Persons who experienced discrimination tended to score lower on health utility measures. The study also revealed a complex relationship between experiences of discrimination and race and gender. Because of these differential social and demographic relationships caution is urged when interpreting self-rated health measures in research, clinical, and policy settings."
"24763518","Bilateral Vestibular Deficiency: Quality of Life and Economic Implications.","IMPORTANCE: Bilateral vestibular deficiency (BVD) causes chronic imbalance and unsteady vision and greatly increases the risk of falls; however, its effects on quality of life and economic impact are not well defined.OBJECTIVE: To quantify disease-specific and health-related quality of life, health care utilization, and economic impact on individuals with BVD in comparison with those with unilateral vestibular deficiency (UVD).DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional survey study of patients with BVD or UVD and healthy controls at an academic medical center. Vestibular dysfunction was diagnosed by means of caloric nystagmography.INTERVENTIONS: Survey questionnaire.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Health status was measured using the Dizziness Handicap Index (DHI) and Health Utility Index Mark 3 (HUI3). Economic burden was estimated using participant responses to questions on disease-specific health care utilization and lost productivity.RESULTS: Fifteen patients with BVD, 22 with UVD, and 23 healthy controls participated. In comparison with patients with UVD and controls, patients with BVD had significantly worse DHI (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.001) and HUI3 scores. Statistically significant between-group differences were observed for overall HUI3 score (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.001) and for specific attributes including vision, hearing, ambulation, emotion, and pain (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.001 for all). Generalized linear model analysis of clinical variables associated with HUI3 scores after adjustment for other variables (including sex, race, education, age, and frequency of dizziness-related outpatient clinic visits) showed that the presence of UVD (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.001) or BVD (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.001), increased dizziness-related emergency room visits (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.002), and increased dizziness-related missed work days (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.001) were independently associated with worse HUI3 scores. Patients with BVD and UVD incurred estimated mean (range) annual economic burdens of $13,019 ($0-$48,830) and $3531 ($0-$48,442) per patient, respectively.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Bilateral vestibular deficiency significantly decreases quality of life and imposes substantial economic burdens on individuals and society. These results underscore the limits of adaptation and compensation in BVD. Furthermore, they quantify the potential benefits of prosthetic restoration of vestibular function both to these individuals and to society."

Four instruments were administered during the trial: Feeling Thermometer (FT), Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI2), Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3), and Short Form 6D (SF-6D). Linear mixed effect models were used to estimate the mean difference in preference scores by treatment group for 9 years.RESULTS: The ILI had higher mean FT (0.019, 95% CI, 0.015-0.024, P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) and SF-6D (0.011, 95% CI, 0.006-0.014, P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) scores than the DSE. No significant group differences were observed for the HUI2 (0.004, 95% CI, -0.003 to 0.010, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.23) and HUI3 (0.004, -0.004 to 0.012, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.36). In year 1, the ILI had higher mean preference scores for all instruments. Thereafter, the increases remained significant only for FT and SF-6D, and the effects also become smaller.CONCLUSIONS: ILI aimed at reducing body weight among persons with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes improves preference-based HRQOL in the short term, but its long-term effect is unclear."
