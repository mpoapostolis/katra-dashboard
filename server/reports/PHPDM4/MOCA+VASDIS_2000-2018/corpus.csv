"17542384","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment: validity and utility in a memory clinic setting.","OBJECTIVE: To prospectively validate the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in a UK memory clinic.METHOD: We administered the MoCA and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) to 32 subjects fulfilling diagnostic criteria for dementia, to 23 subjects fulfilling diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and to 12 memory clinic comparison subjects, at baseline and then at 6-month follow-up. Clinical diagnoses for dementia and MCI were made according to ICD-10 and Petersen criteria. The sensitivity and specificity of both measures were assessed for detection of MCI and dementia.RESULTS: With a cut-off score of 26, the MMSE had a sensitivity of 17% to detect subjects with MCI, whereas the MoCA detected 83%. The MMSE had a sensitivity of 25% to detect subjects with dementia, whereas the MoCA detected 94%. Specificity for the MMSE was 100%, and specificity for the MoCA was 50%. Of subjects with MCI, 35% developed dementia within 6 months, and all scored less than 26 points on the MoCA at baseline.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA is a useful brief screening tool for the detection of mild dementia or MCI in subjects scoring over 25 points on the MMSE. In patients already diagnosed with MCI, the MoCA helps identify those at risk of developing dementia at 6-month follow-up."
"17328916","Mild cognitive impairment in symptomatic and asymptomatic cerebrovascular disease.","We tried to evaluate and to compare usefulness of two brief cognitive tests in early detection of cognitive decline in subjects with increased cerebrovascular (CV) risk. As CV risk factors are recognised as important in etiology of dementia, we also aimed to determine the possible associations of specific CV risk factors and cognitive results. Patients (PGs) with first-ever stroke or TIA (N=110) and CV symptoms-free controls (CGs) with CV risk factors present (N=45) matched for age, gender and education level were tested using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) on admission, at three- and six-month points. In all subjects, detailed CV risk factors profile was assessed. We observed the decrement in cognitive performance during the six-month study period in both groups, more evident if MoCA (p&lt;0.001) than if MMSE was used (p=0.022). Six months after first stroke/TIA 83.6% PGs scored below normal range on MoCA. In PGs, positive associations for cognitive decrement and multiple CV risk factors (&gt;2) were found (p=0.034 for MMSE; p=0.002 for MoCA). In CGs, positive associations were found for cognitive decrement and arterial hypertension with increased IMT values (p&lt;0.001 for MMSE) and for multiple CV risk factors and arterial hypertension (p=0.003 for MoCA). The use of MoCA could aid to early recognition of cognitive deficits in persons with increased CV risk. Individuals with multiple CV risk factors seem to have increased risk of cognitive decline."
"17260164","Anticoagulation treatment for the reduction of stroke in atrial fibrillation: a cohort study to examine the gap between guidelines and routine medical practice.","BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart arrhythmia, affecting 6% of people over 65 years, and carries a 4.5% average annual stroke risk, which can be reduced by appropriate anticoagulation. A multi-centre observational study, Management and Outcomes in the Care of Atrial fibrillation in Germany (MOCA) was conducted to evaluate the current anticoagulation treatment pattern in patients with AF in Germany.METHODS: Patients with AF were recruited from December 2003 to June 2004 in physician practices. Clinical data including International Normalised Ratio (INR) values and anticoagulation strategy were obtained from the physician chart and the patient follow-up, documenting hospitalisations, medications, and complications, was conducted at three and six months. Main outcome measures included anticoagulation methods, practice guidelines adherence and time within recommended anticoagulation range.RESULTS: 361 patients with AF (mean age 71+/-9, 61% male) were recruited in 45 physician practices. 90% of all patients had been treated with Vitamin K-Antagonists (VKA) at some time since AF-diagnosis, 88% were still treated. 10% of patients received aspirin as their anticoagulation therapy. Monitoring occurred at least once a month in over 70% of patients. Monitored INR values were 56% of the time within, 14% below and 30% over the recommended target range. A gap of 40% existed between the guideline recommendations and actual practice. Younger patients (&lt;60 years of age) with no documented risk factors for stroke were over-treated with VKAs and patients older than 75 years without contraindications for anticoagulation were under-treated.CONCLUSIONS: This study presents 'real-life' data in treating patients with AF in Germany and identifies the potential to advance the quality of care with respect to anticoagulation."
"19672065","The validity, reliability and clinical utility of the Hong Kong Montreal Cognitive Assessment (HK-MoCA) in patients with cerebral small vessel disease.","AIMS: To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Hong Kong Montreal Cognitive Assessment (HK-MoCA) in patients with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD).METHODS: 40 SVD patients and 40 matched controls were recruited. Concurrent and criterion validity, inter-rater and test-retest reliability, internal consistency of the HK-MoCA were examined and clinical observations were made.RESULTS: Performance on the HK-MoCA was significantly predicted by both executive (beta = 0.23, p = 0.013) and non-executive (beta = 0.64, p &lt; 0.001) composite scores. It differentiated SVD patients from controls (area under the curve = 0.81, p &lt; 0.001) with an optimal cutoff at 21/22. Reliability, internal consistency and clinical utility were good.CONCLUSION: The HK-MoCA is a useful cognitive screening instrument for use in SVD patients."
"20889166","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is superior to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for the detection of vascular cognitive impairment after acute stroke.","BACKGROUND: The majority of patient with post-stroke Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI) have Vascular Cognitive Impairment No Dementia (VCIND). The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) has been criticized as a poor screening test for VCIND due to insensitivity to visuospatial and executive function impairments. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was designed to be more sensitive to such deficits and may therefore be a superior screening instrument for VCIND.METHODS: Stable patients within 14days of their index stroke without significant physical disability, aphasia, dysarthria, active psychiatric illness or pre-existing dementia were eligible. Cognitive and neurological measures were administered after informed consent.RESULTS: 100 patients were recruited. Of the 57 patients with unimpaired MMSE scores, 18 (32%) patients had an impaired MoCA score. By comparison, only 2 out of the 41 (4.9%) patients with unimpaired MoCA scores had impaired MMSE scores. Moreover, MMSE domain subtest scores could not differentiate between groups of differing screening test results, whilst MoCA domain subtest scores (Visuospatial/Executive Function, Attention and Recall) could.CONCLUSION: The MoCA is more sensitive than the MMSE in screening for cognitive impairment after acute stroke. Longitudinal studies are required to establish the prognostic value of MoCA and MMSE evaluation in the acute post-stroke period for cognitive impairment as defined by the standard method of formal neuropsychological evaluation 3-6 months after stroke."
"20884013","Breath holding index in detection of early cognitive decline.","The aim of the study was to evaluate role of breath holding index (BHI) as a functional parameter for intracranial subclinical atherosclerotic changes in recognizing patients who are at risk for developing cognitive impairment of the vascular type. We included 60 volunteers divided into 3 groups according to age and presence of cognitive impairment (healthy subjects 30-40 years old, controls 60-70 years old and subjects with mild cognitive impairment 60-70 years old). We excluded individuals with moderate and severe carotid stenosis. There was a decreasing trend in the mean blood flow velocities of the intracranial blood vessels due to age increase, but it was not statistically significant. BHI values were 1.66±0.20 in the first group, 1.35±0.31 in the second and 0.69±0.30 in the third group. There was a statistically significant difference between the first two groups and the group with a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) score (29±1, 27±1 and 19±1 respectively), no statistically significant difference was found in Mini mental state exam (MMSE) score (29±1, 28±1, and 28±1 respectively). After regressing out age and conventional vascular risk factors, we found a good correlation between the decreasing trend in BHI values and MoCA score, and no statistically significant correlation between the BHI values and MMSE score. Results of our study show that BHI test as a parameter of impaired cerebrovascular reactivity (intracranial small vessel wall dysfunction) might differentiate individuals with early cognitive decline from healthy subjects."
"20378863","Underestimation of cognitive impairment by Mini-Mental State Examination versus the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in patients with transient ischemic attack and stroke: a population-based study.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is insensitive to mild cognitive impairment and executive function. The more recently developed Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), an alternative, brief 30-point global cognitive screen, might pick up more cognitive abnormalities in patients with cerebrovascular disease.METHODS: In a population-based study (Oxford Vascular Study) of transient ischemic attack and stroke, the MMSE and MoCA were administered to consecutive patients at 6-month or 5-year follow-up. Accepted cutoffs of MMSE &lt;27 and MoCA &lt;26 were taken to indicate cognitive impairment.RESULTS: Of 493 patients, 413 (84%) were testable. Untestable patients were older (75.5 versus 69.9 years, P&lt;0.001) and often had dysphasia (24%) or dementia (15%). Although MMSE and MoCA scores were highly correlated (r(2)=0.80, P&lt;0.001), MMSE scores were skewed toward higher values, whereas MoCA scores were normally distributed: median and interquartile range 28 (26 to 29) and 23 (20 to 26), respectively. Two hundred ninety-one of 413 (70%) patients had MoCA &lt;26 of whom 162 had MMSE &gt; or =27, whereas only 5 patients had MoCA &gt; or =26 and MMSE &lt;27 (P&lt;0.0001). In patients with MMSE &gt; or =27, MoCA &lt;26 was associated with higher Rankin scores (P=0.0003) and deficits in delayed recall, abstraction, visuospatial/executive function, and sustained attention.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA picked up substantially more cognitive abnormalities after transient ischemic attack and stroke than the MMSE, demonstrating deficits in executive function, attention, and delayed recall."
"20055242","Assessment of subtle cognitive impairment in stroke-free patients with carotid disease.","Carotid disease is a known risk factor for stroke and stroke is a known risk factor for cognitive impairment, but relation between carotid artery stenosis and cognitive function in asymptomatic individuals is less clear. Most patients have only minor complaints of cognitive dysfunction and assessment with usual tests is not sensitive enough. The study included 26 stroke-free patients (15 male and 11 female), mean age 66.3 +/- 8.7 years, with advanced internal carotid artery stenosis or/and occlusion (ICAs/o). Left ICAs/o was present in 11, right ICAs/o in eight, and bilateral ICAs/o in seven patients. History was taken and assessment of risk factors, brain CT scan and neurologic examination were performed. Cognitive functions were tested by use of Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). All patients were asymptomatic, except for two patients that presented with repeated transient ischemic attack (TIA). In all subjects median MMSE scores were within the normal range (27.5; IQ range 25-29), while mean MoCA scores were abnormal (22.6 +/- 3.4). Patients with left ICAs/o scored slightly better on MoCA (22.9 +/- 3.3) than patients with right ICAs/o (22.4 +/- 4.0). Delayed recall MoCA subtest was impaired in 22/26 patients and visuospatial subtest in 23/26 patients; however, there was no statistically significant difference according to the side of ICAs/o. Patients with the presence of one or two risk factors scored lower on visuospatial/executive MoCA subtests (P = 0.018) as compared with patients with multiple risk factors. MoCA proved to be a sensitive tool for assessment of mild cognitive changes in stroke-free patients with advanced ICAs/o. Decline was most pronounced in visuospatial, executive and short-memory functions."
"22193539","Analysis of cognitive dysfunction with silent cerebral infarction: a prospective study in Chinese patients.","To investigate the relationship between Silent Cerebral Infarction (SCI) and cognitive impairment to testify that Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a more sensitive screening tool than the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) to identify cognitive deficits in patients with SCI. We recruited 196 individuals in Shanghai of China and divided them into 2 groups: the SCI group including 112 individuals (45 men and 67 women; aged from 43 to 70 years old) and the control group including 84 individuals (43 men and 41 women; aged from 42 to 79 years old). We collected information including participants' gender, age, blood glucose, kidney function, blood lipids, blood pressure, Electrocardiogram (ECG), carotid artery ultrasound, MMSE score, and MoCA score. SAS software (version 9.1) was used to perform statistical analysis on physical examinations outcomes from 196 participants. Furthermore, multiple logistic regression model was built up to screen out the independent risk factors of SCI. Besides, Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis was also used. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that abnormal ECG and existence of carotid artery plaques were independent risk factors of SCI occurrence, while MoCA scores was negatively associated with SCI risk. Moreover, MoCA might be more valuable in predicting vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) than MMSE (0.667 vs 0.626). We found that the MMSE was generally insensitive to detect cognitive impairment; but the MoCA has a good balance of sensitivity and specificity at the cut-score of 26. We found that the patients with SCI might accompany with VCI and the MoCA appeared to be an excellent screening test for patients with SCI, worthy of being promoted in the clinical practitioning on Chinese population."
"22176962","[The evolution of cognition and its influence factors after stroke].","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the evolution of cognitive function and its influence factors, so as to provide evidence for guiding treatment of cognitive impairment after stroke.METHODS: A total of 98 cases of patients with stroke admitted in the First and Second Affiliated Hospital of Medical College of Xi'an Jiaotong University and Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital between April and September 2009 were enrolled and recruited. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive function rating scale (MoCA) were adopted to assess the evolution of cognition at acute phase (within 2 weeks), 6 weeks, and 12 weeks after stroke among patients within 2 weeks after onset, questionnaire score = 56, without aphasia and consciousness disturbance and at least one side of upper extremities muscle force = grade 3.RESULTS: When using MMSE scale as criteria, the incidence of cognitive impairment was 24.5% at acute phase, 12.1% at 6 weeks and 9.9% at 12 weeks after stroke, while the incidence was 86.8%, 68.2%, and 38.0% respectively when using MoCA scale as criteria. The scales of MMSE and MoCA were increased and the incidence of cognitive impairment was decreased within 12 weeks after stroke. Logistic regression analysis indicated that, advanced age (ß = -0.124), hypertension (ß = -3.705), low education level(ß = 0.560) and depression after stroke (ß = 4.613) were related with cognitive impairment after stroke (all P values &lt; 0.05); low education level(ß = 0.710), coronary heart disease (ß = -3.649), elevated total cholesterol (TC) (ß = -3.361) and low density lipid cholesterol (LDL-C) (ß = -5.833), and depression (ß = -3.612) delayed recovery of cognition after stroke.CONCLUSIONS: The cognitive function improves and the incidence of cognitive impairment lowers as the time goes on within 12 weeks after stroke. The factors that may affect the improvement of cognitive function include low educational level, coronary heart disease, elevated TC and LDL-C, and post-stroke depression."
"22156700","MoCA, ACE-R, and MMSE versus the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network Vascular Cognitive Impairment Harmonization Standards Neuropsychological Battery after TIA and stroke.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R) are proposed as short cognitive tests for use after stroke, but there are few published validations against a neuropsychological battery. We studied the relationship between MoCA, ACE-R, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in patients with cerebrovascular disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).METHODS: One hundred consecutive non-institutionalized patients had the MMSE, MoCA, ACE-R, and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network Vascular Cognitive Impairment Harmonization Standards Neuropsychological Battery = 1 year after transient ischemic attack or stroke in a population-based study. MCI was diagnosed using modified Petersen criteria in which subjective cognitive complaint is not required (equivalent to cognitive impairment-no dementia) and subtyped by number and type of cognitive domains affected.RESULTS: Among 91 nondemented subjects completing neuropsychological testing (mean/SD age, 73.4/11.6 years; 44% female; 56% stroke), 39 (42%) had MCI (amnestic multiple domain=10, nonamnestic multiple domain=9, nonamnestic single domain=19, amnestic single domain=1). Sensitivity and specificity for MCI were optimal with MoCA &lt;25 (sensitivity=77%, specificity=83%) and ACE-R &lt;94 (sensitivity=83%, specificity=73%). Both tests detected amnestic MCI better than nonamnestic single-domain impairment. MMSE only achieved sensitivity &gt;70% at a cutoff of &lt;29, mainly due to relative insensitivity to single-domain impairment.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA and ACE-R had good sensitivity and specificity for MCI defined using the Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network Vascular Cognitive Impairment Battery =1 year after transient ischemic attack and stroke, whereas the MMSE showed a ceiling effect. However, optimal cutoffs will depend on use for screening (high sensitivity) or diagnosis (high specificity). Lack of timed measures of processing speed may explain the relative insensitivity of the MoCA and ACE-R to single nonmemory domain impairment."
"21945986","Cognitive performance in asymptomatic patients with advanced carotid disease.","OBJECTIVE: : In the absence of stroke or transient ischemic attack, patients with advanced carotid stenosis or occlusion (ICAs/o) are considered asymptomatic, yet they are prone to mostly subtle cognitive impairment.BACKGROUND: : The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) often fails to detect mild cognitive impairment. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is more sensitive in recognizing such changes.METHODS: : Scores on the MoCA and MMSE were compared in 70 asymptomatic patients with ICAs/o and 70 controls matched for demographic variables and vascular risk factors.RESULTS: : MMSE scores fell mostly within the normal range in both patients and controls. Differences were significant for total MoCA scores (P&lt;0.001). Patients with ICAs/o performed worse on visuospatial and executive function (P=0.018), abstraction (P&lt;0.001), and delayed recall (P&lt;0.001). Lower MoCA scores were associated with diabetes (odds ratio=6.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.277-32.220; P=0.024) and older age (odds ratio=0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.780-0.956; P=0.004). Patients with diabetes performed worse on delayed recall (P&lt;0.001), and patients with hypertension were worse on the MoCA naming subtest (P=0.04).CONCLUSIONS: : The MoCA successfully identified reduced cognitive status in patients with ICAs/o. The MoCA subtest scores revealed a pattern of cognitive impairment similar to that documented in other studies using more extensive neuropsychological tests. MoCA could be used as part of the clinical evaluation of patients with ICAs/o."
"21943640","Carotid endarterectomy protects elderly patients from cognitive decline: a prospective study.","BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) reduces the risk of stroke in selected patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid disease, but its beneficial influence on cognitive performance in the elderly remains debatable. This prospective study sought to determine early and long-term neurocognitive outcomes after CEA for severe unilateral carotid artery stenosis.METHODS: From July 2006 to December 2008, 75 symptomatic (group A) and 70 asymptomatic patients (group B) aged 65 years and older underwent CEA under general anesthesia. Sixty-eight age- and sex-matched individuals who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the same period at our institution served as a control group (group H). Patients with contralateral severe carotid stenosis or occlusion and those with dementia, depression, or a history of major stroke were excluded. Cognitive function was assessed using 2 neuropsychological tests (the Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]) performed preoperatively (T0) and then 3 (T1) and 12 months (T2) after operation. A change of at least 2 points between the scores at T0 and T2 was arbitrarily considered as clinically significant.RESULTS: At T0, group A revealed significant cognitive impairments in both mean test scores by comparison with group H (P = .005 and P &lt; .01, respectively), whereas there were no significant differences between groups A and B, or between groups B and H. Postoperatively, symptomatic patients had significant improvements in their mean cognitive performance scores in both tests (P &lt; .01 and P &lt; .01, respectively), whereas there were no changes in the asymptomatic and control patients' scores. No significant differences emerged for the MMSE scores in the 3 groups, whereas there was a marginally significant difference in the MoCA scores between groups A and H (P = .08), but not for A versus B or B versus H when clinically significant scores were considered.CONCLUSION: Our study showed that only elderly symptomatic patients with severe carotid lesions had a significant improvement in cognitive performance scores after CEA, although the benefit was considered clinically not significant. This suggests that CEA does not diminish neurocognitive functions, but it might provide some protection against cognitive decline in the elderly."
"21903955","Transient cognitive impairment in TIA and minor stroke.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acute cognitive impairment and delirium occur after major stroke and are associated with poor cognitive outcome. We conducted a population-based study to determine whether transient cognitive impairment (TCI) is seen acutely after cerebral transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke, and whether it predicts long-term cognitive decline.METHODS: Mini-mental-state examination was performed in consecutive testable patients with TIA or minor stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale =3) seen acutely (1-7 days) in the Oxford Vascular Study (2002-2005) versus after 7 days, and in referrals seen acutely who had a subsequent noncerebrovascular diagnosis. We defined TCI as a baseline Mini-mental-state examination score =2 points below the 1-month follow-up score, and identified cognitive impairment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] &lt;26/30) and severe dementia at 1-, 2-, and 5-year follow-up.RESULTS: In 280 TIA and minor stroke patients (mean age/SD 73.5/11.8 years), TCI was more frequent in those seen at 1 to 7 days (80/206; 38.9%) versus later (14/74; 19%; P=0.002) or in noncerebrovascular patients (10/47; 21%; P=0.004). TCI was associated with acute confusion (OR, 5.5; 95% CI, 2.5-11.7; P&lt;0.0001), acute infarct on computed tomography (OR, 2.0; 1.2-3.5; P=0.01), and with residual focal deficits (OR,1.94; 1.13-3.34; P=0.01). However, it was still seen acutely in those whose focal deficits had resolved by time of assessment (41/120; 34%). Although patients with TCI had similar Mini-mental-state examination score by 1 month compared with those without TCI, their 5-year risks of cognitive impairment (OR, 4.3; 1.2-15.7; P=0.03) and severe dementia (OR, 4.9; 1.0-25.8; P=0.05) were increased.CONCLUSIONS: TCI is a manifestation of TIA and minor stroke, and may persist beyond resolution of focal symptoms. Our findings have implications for definitions in TIA and minor stroke and suggest that cognitive fragility may be revealed by minor cerebrovascular events."
"21807379","Frontal subcortical ischemia is crucial for post stroke cognitive impairment.","BACKGROUND: The incidence of post stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) and predictive factors for PSCI among patients with acute lacunar infarcts is unclear.OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of acute lacunar infarcts and chronic white matter disease in the development of PSCI.METHODS: Prospective cohort study of stroke patients attending a tertiary neurology center. Patients with MRI confirmed acute lacunar infarcts without pre-existing dementia were recruited. Logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for developing PSCI.RESULTS: 145 patients with a mean age of 55.8 years were studied of which 48 patients (33.1%) were identified to have PSCI. Patients with PSCI performed worse on the MMSE, MOCA and FAB and had significantly greater white matter hyperintensity (WMH) in the frontal subcortical (FSC) region (p = 0.006) and higher frontal subcortical acute infarct load (p = 0.002). Logistic regression demonstrated that deep subcortical WMH (odds ratio, OR = 1.45) and acute FSC infarcts (OR = 1.51) were associated with PSCI. High WMH load without acute FSC infarcts was associated with increased risk of PSCI (OR = 4.1). When patients developed acute FSC infarcts on pre-existing severe WMH, the risk of PSCI increased substantially (OR = 11.0).CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acute lacunar infarcts in the FSC region have 1.5 times risk of PSCI. This risk increases substantially to 11 times when there is pre-existing severe white matter disease."
"21757673","The montreal cognitive assessment: short cognitive evaluation in a large stroke trial.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cognitive function is often ignored in stroke research trials. The brief Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) may be sensitive to stroke-related cognitive deficits.METHODS: We evaluated the feasibility of administering the MoCA at 3 months in a large stroke trial (A Very Early Rehabilitation Trial [AVERT]).RESULTS: Data (blinded to intervention group) are presented for 294 patients with mean age of 70.6 years (SD, 12.8); 220 (75%) completed the MoCA, 54 (18%) had missing data, and 20 (7%) had died. Of those surviving to 3 months, the MoCA was completed by 87% with mild stroke, 79% with moderate stroke, and 67% with severe stroke on admission. Mean MoCA score was 21.1 (SD 7.5) out of 30; only 78 of 220 (35%) patients attained the &quot;normal&quot; cutoff (=26).CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA is a feasible global cognitive screening tool in stroke trials.

"21679070","Endovenous mechanochemical ablation of great saphenous vein incompetence using the ClariVein device: a safety study.","PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility and safety of endovenous mechanochemical ablation (MOCA) for the treatment of great saphenous vein (GSV) incompetence.METHODS: The newly developed ClariVein device uses a technique that combines mechanical endothelial damage using a rotating wire with the infusion of a liquid sclerosant. Heating of the vein and tumescent anesthesia are not required; only local anesthesia is utilized at the insertion site. In a pilot study, 30 limbs in 25 patients (18 women; mean age 52 years) with GSV incompetence were treated with MOCA using polidocanol at 2 centers. Initial technical success, complications, patient satisfaction, and classification by venous clinical severity score (VCSS) were assessed 6 weeks after the treatment.RESULTS: Initial technical success of MOCA was 100%. There were no major adverse events. Minor complications consisted of 9 local ecchymoses at the puncture site and superficial phlebitis that resolved within a week in 4 limbs. Duplex ultrasonography at 6 weeks showed 26 (87%) of 30 veins were completely occluded; 3 veins showed partial recanalization in the proximal (n = 2) and distal GSV. One patient had full segment recanalization and was successfully retreated. The VCSS significantly improved at 6 weeks (p &lt; 0.001). Patient satisfaction was high, with a median satisfaction of 8.8 on a 0-10 scale.CONCLUSION: This study showed that endovenous MOCA, using polidocanol, is feasible and safe in the treatment of GSV incompetence. Larger studies with a prolonged follow-up are indicated to prove the efficacy of this technique in terms of obliteration rates."
"21560886","Detecting cognitive impairment in clients with mild stroke or transient ischemic attack attending a stroke prevention clinic.","Twenty clients diagnosed with probable transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke attending a stroke prevention clinic (SPC) were screened for cognitive function, as one inclusion criteria for a pilot study examining medication adherence and hypertension management. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was administered at study admission followed by a second screening within two weeks using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) tool. Individual scores for the MMSE and MoCA were compared. Results demonstrated that the majority (90%) of participants scored in the normal range (&gt; or = 26) on the MMSE (m = 27.9 sd 2.15). However, more than half (55%) of participants had some degree of cognitive impairment based on MoCA scores of &lt; 26 (m = 23.65 sd = 4.082). MoCA scores demonstrated a wider range (Range = 16) compared to the range of MMSE scores (Range = 8). MoCA scores were significantly (p = &lt; 0.05) lower than the MMSE scores. Findings from this pilot study suggest that the MoCA test will identify more deficits in cognition among SPC clients diagnosed with cerebrovascular disease. Further investigation is underway to determine the implications of these deficits on SPC clients' abilities to follow medication and other treatment regimens."
"21530727","The Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment in persons with mild subacute stroke: relationship to functional outcome.","OBJECTIVES: To compare Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) global and subscores in classifying cognitive impairment in persons with mild stroke and to explore the relationship between admission and discharge functional status and improvement.DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of data.SETTING: Acute rehabilitation unit of a large urban university-affiliated hospital.PARTICIPANTS: Inpatients with stroke (N=72; mean age, 70y; median time poststroke, 8.5d) and mild neurologic (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 4) and cognitive deficits (median MMSE score, 25).INTERVENTION: Not applicable.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Admission cognitive status was assessed by using the MMSE and MoCA. The motor subscale of the FIM instrument (mFIM) and motor relative functional efficiency was used to assess discharge functional status and improvement.RESULTS: The MoCA classified more persons as cognitively impaired than the MMSE (89% vs 63%, respectively; using a cutoff score of 27 on the MMSE and 26 on the MoCA). The MoCA also showed less of a ceiling effect than the MMSE, higher internal reliability (Cronbach a=.78 compared with a=.60), and marginally stronger associations with discharge functional status (r=.40; P&lt;.001) than the MMSE (r=0.30; P&lt;.05). The MoCA visuoexecutive subscore was the strongest predictor of functional status (P=.01) and improvement (P=.02) in global and subscores for both tests.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA may be an important cognitive screening tool for persons with stroke and mild cognitive dysfunction on an acute rehabilitation unit. Lower visuoexecutive subscores may assist in identifying persons at risk for decreased functional gains in self-care and mobility (mFIM) during inpatient rehabilitation. The findings justify further validation studies of the MoCA in persons with subacute stroke."
"21474808","Is the Montreal Cognitive Assessment superior to the Mini-Mental State Examination to detect poststroke cognitive impairment? A study with neuropsychological evaluation.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A screening test is required to improve the diagnosis of poststroke cognitive impairment. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a newly designed screening test, has been found to be more sensitive than Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), but its clinical value has not been established by means of a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. This study was designed to assess the value of MoCA and MMSE to detect poststroke cognitive impairment determined by a neuropsychological battery.METHODS: Both screening tests and a neuropsychological battery were administered during the acute phase in 95 patients referred for recent infarct or hemorrhage. Raw MMSE and MoCA scores were used with published cutoffs and new cutoff scores for MMSE and MoCA were also computed after adjustment for age and education.RESULTS: Using raw scores, MoCA was more frequently impaired (P=0.0001) than MMSE. MoCA showed good sensitivity (sensitivity, 0.94) but moderate specificity (specificity, 0.42; positive predictive value, 0.77; negative predictive value, 0.76), whereas an inverse profile was observed for MMSE (sensitivity, 0.66; specificity, 0.97; positive predictive value, 0.98; negative predictive value, 0.58). Adjusted scores with new cutoffs (MMSE(adj) =24, MoCA(adj) =20) provided good sensitivity and very good specificity for both tests (MMSE(adj): sensitivity, 0.7, specificity, 0.97, positive predictive value, 0.98, negative predictive value, 0.61; MoCA(adj): sensitivity, 0.67, specificity, 0.9, positive predictive value, 0.93, negative predictive value, 0.57). On receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, areas under the curve of all scores were &gt;0.88.CONCLUSIONS: The previously reported high sensitivity of MoCA is associated with low specificity. Both screening tests are moderately sensitive to acute poststroke cognitive impairment. This study provides indications for the diagnosis of poststroke cognitive impairment."
"21449172","[The MoCA scale in diagnosis of the amnestic syndrome--case report].","AIM: Among main symptoms of the amnestic syndrome we can distinguish: short-term and long-term memory deterioration, deficiency of the effectiveness of learning, the anterograde amnesia and the retrograde amnesia, lack of the orientation in the place and in the time and confabulations. The aim of the study is to introduce the unknown tool of cognitive assessment named Montreal Assessment Cognitive (MoCA). The authors want to indicate the diagnostic accuracy of the scale in the examination of the amnestic patient.METHOD: In the neuropsychological examination of the amnestic patient, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale was used.RESULTS: The patient correctly performed the tasks which estimated effectiveness of the visual-motor coordination, language abilities (naming, repeating of the sentences) and effectiveness of the short-term memory. Difficulties in the remaining tasks indicate at deficiency of the effectiveness of the learning ability, long-term memory (recognition), abstractive thinking and the orientation in the place and time. Deterioration of the working memory and executive functions is also noticeable.CONCLUSIONS: Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale is a useful tool for the evaluation of the cognitive functions among amnestic patients."
"21282950","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the mini-mental state examination as screening instruments for cognitive impairment: item analyses and threshold scores.","AIMS: To perform an item analysis of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) versus the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in the prediction of cognitive impairment, and to examine the characteristics of different MoCA threshold scores.METHODS: 135 subjects enrolled in a longitudinal clinicopathologic study were administered the MoCA by a single physician and the MMSE by a trained research assistant. Subjects were classified as cognitively impaired or cognitively normal based on independent neuropsychological testing.RESULTS: 89 subjects were found to be cognitively normal, and 46 cognitively impaired (20 with dementia, 26 with mild cognitive impairment). The MoCA was superior in both sensitivity and specificity to the MMSE, although not all MoCA tasks were of equal predictive value. A MoCA threshold score of 26 had a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 52% in this population. In a population with a 20% prevalence of cognitive impairment, a threshold of 24 was optimal (negative predictive value 96%, positive predictive value 47%).CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests the potential for creating an abbreviated MoCA. For screening in primary care, the MoCA threshold of 26 appears optimal. For testing in a memory disorders clinic, a lower threshold has better predictive value."
"23165343","Effects of falls experience on cognitive functions and physical activities in community-dwelling individuals with chronic stroke.","The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of falls experience on cognitive functions and physical activities in community-dwelling patients with chronic hemiparetic stroke. Further, the feasibility of using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to predict falls in the patients was evaluated. Forty-seven patients with chronic stroke participated in this study. The participants included 25 patients with falls experience (faller group) and 22 patients without falls experience (nonfaller group) in the previous 6 months. The participants were assessed clinically using the MoCA, the Berg Balance Scale, the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), the Timed Up-and-Go Test, the 10 Meter Walk Test, and the 6 Minute Walk Test. The individuals in the nonfaller group performed significantly better in all clinical measures than those in the faller group. In the nonfaller group, the MoCA was moderately correlated with only two measurements, that is, the 10 Meter Walk Test and the DGI. In the faller group, the MoCA was moderately correlated with four measurements, including the Timed Up-and-Go Test, the 6 Minute Walk Test, the Berg Balance Test, and the DGI. Physical and cognitive functions play a role in falls. Therefore, to decrease the risk of falls among community-dwelling stroke patients, clinicians should consider their physical activities and cognitive functions irrespective of their falls experience."
"23161865","The effects of an aerobic and resistance exercise training program on cognition following stroke.","BACKGROUND: Cognitive benefits obtained from exercise in healthy populations support the idea that aerobic and resistance training (AT+RT) would confer benefit for poststroke recovery. However, there is little evidence regarding the effectiveness of such programs.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of a 6-month exercise program of AT+RT on cognition in consecutively enrolled patients with motor impairments =10 weeks poststroke.METHODS: Outcomes were measured before and after 6 months of AT+RT on 41 patients. Cognition was measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Secondary measures included evaluation of gas exchange anaerobic threshold (ATge), body composition by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and depressive symptoms by questionnaire.RESULTS: There were significant improvements in overall MoCA scores (22.5 ± 4.5 to 24.0 ± 3.9, P &lt; .001) as well as in the subdomains of attention/concentration (4.7 ± 1.7 to 5.2 ± 1.3, P = .03) and visuospatial/executive function (3.4 ± 1.1 to 3.9 ± 1.1, P = .002). There was a significant reduction in the proportion of patients meeting the threshold criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline compared with posttraining (65.9% vs 36.6%, P &lt; .001). In a linear regression model, there was a positive association between change in cognitive function and change in fat-free mass of the nonaffected limbs (ß = .002; P = .005) and change in attention/concentration and change in ATge (ß = .383; P = .001), independent of age, sex, time from stroke, and change in fat mass and depression score.CONCLUSION: A combined training model (AT+RT) resulted in improvements in cognitive function and a reduction in the proportion of patients meeting the threshold criteria for MCI. Change in cognition was positively associated with change in fat-free mass and ATge."
"23150114","Associations between EEG beta power abnormality and diagnosis in cognitive impairment post cerebral infarcts.","Cerebral infarct is a common disease of older adults, which could increase the risk for cognitive impairment and dementia. Electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics were analyzed to investigate the applied value in the assessment of cognitive impairment of the cerebral infarct patients. One hundred ten subjects with cerebral infarcts (including 65 cases of cognitive impairment patients (CI-CI) and 45 cases of cognitive normality patients (CI-NC)) and 110 normal health persons (NC) were recruited between July 2009 and March 2011 at the Department of Neurology. All of the patients were analyzed by EEG within 1 day they were hospitalized. The EEG analysis results were compared with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale (assessed within 2 weeks) with the methods of correlation analysis, clustering analysis, and concordance analysis. The results indicated that CI-CI patients had significantly lower EEG beta power (0.832<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.203 mcV(2)) relative to the CI-NC group (1.493<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.271 mcV(2), P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01) or NC group (1.565<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.345 mcV(2), P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01). Significant negative correlation between the beta power and infarct size (as well as infarct number) was discovered (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.88881 and -0.66498, respectively, both P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). There was a good concordance between K-means clustering algorithm calculating the beta power and MoCA scoring (Kappa<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.851, P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). The preliminary findings suggest that the recognition techniques of EEG hold considerable promise for the assessment of cognitive impairment post cerebral infarcts within 2 weeks and which related to the size of infarcts and number of infarcts."
"23141679","Postoperative pain and early quality of life after radiofrequency ablation and mechanochemical endovenous ablation of incompetent great saphenous veins.","OBJECTIVE: Thermal ablative techniques of varicose veins carry a risk of heat-related complications, including postoperative pain. Mechanochemical endovenous ablation (MOCA) might avoid these complications and reduce postoperative pain because of the absence of thermal energy. This study evaluated postoperative pain and quality of life after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and MOCA for great saphenous vein (GSV) incompetence.METHODS: Sixty-eight patients with unilateral GSV incompetence were treated with either RFA or MOCA in this prospective observational study. Patients monitored their pain for the first 14 postoperative days on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS). They also completed the general (RAND 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey) and disease-specific (Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire) quality of life questionnaires before and 6 weeks after treatment.RESULTS: Patients treated with MOCA reported significantly less postoperative pain than patients treated with RFA during the first 14 days after treatment (4.8 ± 9.7 mm vs 18.6 ± 17.0 mm; P &lt; .001) (mean VAS over 14 days). The lower postoperative pain score was associated with a significantly earlier return to normal activities (1.2 ± 1.8 vs 2.4 ± 2.8 days; P = .02) and work resumption (3.3 ± 4.7 vs 5.6 ± 5.8 days, respectively; P = .02). At 6 weeks, patients in both groups perceived an improved change in health status and an improved disease-specific quality of life.CONCLUSIONS: MOCA is associated with significantly less postoperative pain, faster recovery, and earlier work resumption compared with RFA in the treatment of GSV incompetence. MOCA and RFA are both related to a rapid improvement in quality of life."
"23138443","Telephone assessment of cognition after transient ischemic attack and stroke: modified telephone interview of cognitive status and telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment versus face-to-face Montreal Cognitive Assessment and neuropsychological battery.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Face-to-face cognitive testing is not always possible in large studies. Therefore, we assessed the telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment (T-MoCA: MoCA items not requiring pencil and paper or visual stimulus) and the modified Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status (TICSm) against face-to-face cognitive tests in patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke.METHODS: In a population-based study, consecutive community-dwelling patients underwent the MoCA and neuropsychological battery &gt;1 year after TIA or stroke, followed by T-MoCA (22 points) and TICSm (39 points) at least 1 month later. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was diagnosed using modified Petersen criteria and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) determined for T-MoCA and TICSm.RESULTS: Ninety-one nondemented subjects completed neuropsychological testing (mean±SD age, 72.9±11.6 years; 54 males; stroke 49%) and 73 had telephone follow-up. MoCA subtest scores for repetition, abstraction, and verbal fluency were significantly worse (P&lt;0.02) by telephone than during face-to-face testing. Reliability of diagnosis for MCI (AUC) were T-MoCA of 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63-0.87) and TICSm of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.68-0.90) vs face-to-face MoCA of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.76-0.94). Optimal cutoffs were 18 to 19 for T-MoCA and 24 to 25 for TICSm. Reliability of diagnosis for MCI (AUC) was greater when only multi-domain impairment was considered (T-MoCA=0.85; 95% CI, 0.75-0.96 and TICSm=0.83, 95% CI, 0.70-0.96) vs face-to-face MoCA=0.87; 95% CI, 0.76-0.97).CONCLUSIONS: Both T-MoCA and TICSm are feasible and valid telephone tests of cognition after TIA and stroke but perform better in detecting multi-domain vs single-domain impairment. However, T-MoCA is limited in its ability to assess visuoexecutive and complex language tasks compared with face-to-face MoCA."
"22929565","Pulse pressure and mild cognitive impairment.","OBJECTIVE: Patients with suboptimal blood pressure (BP) control may remain with an elevated cardiovascular risk and risk for cognitive impairment. Pulse pressure (PP) assessed with ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) or self-measurement so far has been an underestimated risk factor for target organ damage.METHODS: One hundred and forty-eight patients were screened: 51 men (34.5%) and 97 women (65.5%), mean age 64.16<U+200A>±<U+200A>11.18 years and a mean hypertension history of 13.1<U+200A>±<U+200A>11.05 years. We gathered full medical and hypertension history, physical examination, laboratory screening and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Neuropsychological profile was assessed with tests (NPTs): Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).RESULTS: Regression analysis found a correlation between day and night PP and NPT results. Mann-Whitney Test (a less than 0.05) was used to find a significant difference (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.02 for MMSE) in the mean values of the NPT results between the groups with PP more than 50 and PP 50<U+200A> mmHg or less. The result was not age dependent. There was also a significant difference between mean values of day-PP (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.01) and night-PP (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.02) between patients with cognitive impairment and those without (respectively more than 55 <U+200A>mmHg and less than 55<U+200A> mmHg).CONCLUSION: Elevated PP during the day, the night or with self-measurement is correlated with cognitive impairment. It is a marker of large artery stiffness and target organ damage not only in the very elderly, but also in younger individuals (mean age 64.16 years)."
"22923608","Cognitive screening in the acute stroke setting.","BACKGROUND: current literature suggests that two-thirds of patients will have cognitive impairment at 3 months post-stroke. Post-stroke cognitive impairment is associated with impaired function and increased mortality. UK guidelines recommend all patients with stroke have a cognitive assessment within 6 weeks. There is no 'gold standard' cognitive screening tool. The Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) is more sensitive than the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in mild cognitive impairment and for cognitive impairment in the non-acute post-stroke setting and in a Chinese-speaking acute stroke setting.METHODS: a convenience sample of 50 patients, admitted with stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), were screened within 14 days, using the MoCA and the MMSE.RESULTS: the mean MoCA was 21.80 versus a mean MMSE of 26.98; 70% were impaired on the MoCA (cut-off &lt;26) versus 26% on MMSE (cut-off &lt;27). The MoCA could be completed in &lt;10 min in 90% of cases.CONCLUSION: the MoCA is easy and quick to use in the acute stroke setting. Further work is required to determine whether a low score on the MoCA in the acute stroke setting will predict the cognitive and functional status and to explore what the best cut-off should be in an acute post-stroke setting."
"22851612","Evaluation of cognitive impairment by the Montreal cognitive assessment in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage: prevalence, risk factors and correlations with 3 month outcomes.","OBJECTIVE: Identification of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH) with cognitive impairment is important for patient management (medical treatment, cognitive rehabilitation and social arrangements). The Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) is currently recommended over the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) by the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorder, in the chronic post-stroke setting. We hypothesised that the MoCA has a better correlation with functional outcome at 3 months than the MMSE.METHODS: We carried out a prospective observational study in Hong Kong over a 2 year period, recruiting patients aged 21-75 years with aSAH admitted within 96 h of ictus. The assessments included the modified Rankin Scale, Lawton Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL), Short Form-36, MoCA and MMSE at 3 months after ictus. Analyses were carried out to compare MoCA with MMSE.RESULTS: 90 patients completed the 3 month assessments. Cognitive impairment (MoCA &lt;26) was determined in 73% of patients at 3 months. Delayed cerebral infarction explained the 31-38% variance in cognitive outcomes (MMSE and MoCA) at 3 months. MoCA demonstrated good discrimination of favourable neurological and IADL outcomes similar to the MMSE in receiver operating characteristics curve analyses.CONCLUSIONS: MoCA defined cognitive impairment was common at 3 months after aSAH and MoCA correlated with functional outcomes similar, but not superior, to the MMSE. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov of the US National Institutes of Health (NCT01038193)."

Conventional treatment group was given conventional treatment with anti-platelet aggregation. In this group, 75 mg aspirin was given three times a day for 3 months. While in combined treatment group, 19.2 mg GBT was given three times a day for 3 months together with conventional treatment (anti-platelet aggregation drugs). Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and transcranial Doppler (TCD) were used to observe changes of cognitive ability and cerebral blood flow in VCIND patients before and after treatment in both groups. Then the clinical data were analyzed so as to compare the efficacy in two groups.RESULTS: After 3 month-treatment in combined treatment group, the scores of executive ability, attention, abstract, delayed memory, orientation in the MoCA were significantly increased compared with those before treatment and those in control group after treatment. Besides, blood flow velocity of anterior cerebral artery increased significantly than that before treatment and that in control group after treatment.CONCLUSIONS: GBT tablet can improve the therapeutic efficacy as well improve cognitive ability and cerebral blood flow supply of patients with VCIND."
"22819353","Cutting a long story short: reaction times in acute stroke are associated with longer term cognitive outcomes.","BACKGROUND: The viability and usefulness of cognitive assessment in acute stroke have been questioned, with practical challenges arising from the focal nature of neurological deficits as well as heterogeneity in arousal state. We aimed to test whether acute measures of attention correlate with attentional function at 3 months post-stroke.METHODS: Patients with confirmed stroke completed 2 computerised cognitive tasks (CogState) within 2 weeks of stroke. The tasks were a simple reaction time task (Detection) and a choice reaction time task (Identification) that required a button press to visual stimuli (playing cards). Each task took approximately 4 min. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and an extended neuropsychological battery were administered at 3 months post-stroke.RESULTS: Thirty-three patients (mean age 75.5 years, SD 11.9) participated in this preliminary study. Correlations indicated that both Detection speed (r=-0.73, p&lt;0.001) and Identification speed (r=-0.61, p=0.007) at baseline were associated with attentional function at 3 months, as measured by established neuropsychological tests (Trails-A, Digit span, Digit symbol). In addition, Detection speed at baseline was correlated with total 3-month MoCA score (r=-0.54, p=0.012).CONCLUSION: Simple and brief computerised assessment of attentional function in acute stroke is possible and is related to longer term attentional and cognitive performance."
"22759627","Differences in cognitive profile between TIA, stroke and elderly memory research subjects: a comparison of the MMSE and MoCA.","BACKGROUND: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) appears more sensitive to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) than the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE): over 50% of TIA and stroke patients with an MMSE score of =27 ('normal' cognitive function) at =6 months after index event, score &lt;26 on the MoCA, a cutoff which has good sensitivity and specificity for MCI in this population. We hypothesized that sensitivity of the MoCA to MCI might in part be due to detection of different patterns of cognitive domain impairment. We therefore compared performance on the MMSE and MoCA in subjects without major cognitive impairment (MMSE score of =24) with differing clinical characteristics: a TIA and stroke cohort in which frontal/executive deficits were expected to be prevalent and a memory research cohort.METHODS: The MMSE and MoCA were done on consecutive patients with TIA or stroke in a population-based study (Oxford Vascular Study) 6 months or more after the index event and on consecutive subjects enrolled in a memory research cohort (the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing). Patients with moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment (MMSE score of &lt;24), dysphasia or inability to use the dominant arm were excluded.RESULTS: Of 207 stroke patients (mean age ± SD: 72 ± 11.5 years, 54% male), 156 TIA patients (mean age 71 ± 12.1 years, 53% male) and 107 memory research subjects (mean age 76 ± 6.6 years, 46% male), stroke patients had the lowest mean ± SD cognitive scores (MMSE score of 27.7 ± 1.84 and MoCA score of 22.9 ± 3.6), whereas TIA (MMSE score of 28.4 ± 1.7 and MoCA score of 24.9 ± 3.3) and memory subject scores (MMSE score of 28.5 ± 1.7 and MoCA score of 25.5 ± 3.0) were more similar. Rates of MoCA score of &lt;26 in subjects with normal MMSE ( =27) were lowest in memory subjects, intermediate in TIA and highest after stroke (34 vs. 48 vs. 67%, p &lt; 0.001). The cerebrovascular patients scored lower than the memory subjects on all MoCA frontal/executive subtests with differences being most marked in visuoexecutive function, verbal fluency and sustained attention (all p &lt; 0.0001) and in stroke versus TIA (after adjustment for age and education). Stroke patients performed worse than TIA patients only on MMSE orientation in contrast to 6/10 subtests of the MoCA. Results were similar after restricting analyses to those with an MMSE score of =27.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA demonstrated more differences in cognitive profile between TIA, stroke and memory research subjects without major cognitive impairment than the MMSE. The MoCA showed between-group differences even in those with normal MMSE and would thus appear to be a useful brief tool to assess cognition in those with MCI, particularly where the ceiling effect of the MMSE is problematic."

One hundred and fifty-seven middle-aged type 2 diabetic patients were enrolled in this cross-section study (age 40~69, mean age 55 ± 7). There were 93 patients with MCI (MoCA score&lt;26) in MCI group and 64 with normal cognitive function (MoCA score = 26) in control group. Information of history of disease, family history, data of BMI, WHR, HbA1c, FINS, C-Peptide (C-P), SBP, DBP, blood lipid (TG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C and carotid ultrasound (carotid IMT, carotid resistance index [RI]) was collected.RESULTS: There were significant differences in the rate of patients with hypertension ([40.63 vs. 58.06%], P=0.026), duration of diabetes mellitus ([3.09 ± 4.04 y vs. 4.80 ± 4.94 y], P=0.024), C-P ([2.79 ± 1.09 ng/ml vs. 2.26 ± 1.00 ng/ml], P=0.008), Max C-IMT ([0.81 ± 0.15 mm vs. 0.91 ± 0.15 mm], P&lt;0.001), Min C-RI (0.71 ± 0.06 vs. 0.68 ± 0.06, P&lt;0.05), and no significant differences in the duration of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, BMI, WHR, HbA1c, SBP, DBP and blood lipid between control group and MCI group. MoCA scores were positively correlated with C-P (r=0.252, P=0.005), and negatively correlated with the history of hypertension (r=-0.244, P=0.002), duration of DM (r=-0.161, P=0.044), Max C-IMT (r=-0.253, P=0.005) and Min C-RI (r=-0.183, P=0.023). Multiple regression analysis showed that history of hypertension (Beta=-0.267, P=0.002), C-P (Beta=0.281, P=0.001) and Min C-RI (Beta=-0.221, P=0.011) were significantly independent determinants for the MoCA scores.CONCLUSIONS: The longer duration of diabetes, history of hypertension, lower serum C-P levels, thickened C-IMT and higher C-RI could be risk factors of MCI in type 2 diabetic patients. This finding could have an important impact on the management of cognitive decline in diabetic patients."
"22676901","Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA): validation study for vascular dementia.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a brief instrument developed for the screening of milder forms of cognitive impairment, having surpassed the well-known limitations of the MMSE. The aim of the present study was to validate the MoCA as well as its short version, which was proposed by the NINDS-CSN VCI Harmonization Standards for screening Vascular Dementia (VaD) patients. The results, based on a homogeneous sample of 34 VaD patients, indicate that the MoCA is a psychometrically valid and reliable instrument for cognitive screening in VaD patients, showing excellent discriminant validity. Both the full and short versions of the MoCA had excellent diagnostic accuracy in discriminating VaD patients, exhibiting an area under curve (AUC) higher than the MMSE [AUC(MoCA full version) = .950; 95% IC = .868-.988; AUC(MoCA short version) = .936; 95% IC = .849-.981; AUC(MMSE) = .860; 95% IC = .754-.932]. With a cutoff below 17 on the MoCA full version and 8 on the short version, the results for sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and classification accuracy were superior compared to the MMSE. In conclusion, both versions of the MoCA are valid, reliable, sensitive and accurate screening instruments for VaD patients."
"22496580","Brief screening tests during acute admission in patients with mild stroke are predictive of vascular cognitive impairment 3-6 months after stroke.","OBJECTIVES: To determine the prognostic value of brief cognitive screening tests administered in the subacute stroke phase (initial 2 weeks) for the detection of significant cognitive impairment 3-6 months after stroke, the authors compared the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).METHODS: Patients with ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack were assessed with both MoCA and MMSE within 14 days after index stroke, followed by a formal neuropsychological evaluation of seven cognitive domains 3-6 months later. Cognitive outcomes were dichotomised as either no-mild (impairment in =2 cognitive domains) or moderate-severe (impairment in = 3 cognitive domains) vascular cognitive impairment. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to compare discriminatory ability.RESULTS: 300 patients were recruited, of whom 239 received formal neuropsychological assessment 3-6 months after the stroke. 60 (25%) patients had moderate-severe VCI. The overall discriminant validity for detection of moderate-severe cognitive impairment was similar for MoCA (ROC 0.85 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.90) and MMSE (ROC 0.83 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.89)), p=0.96). Both MoCA (21/22) and MMSE (25/26) had similar discriminant indices at their optimal cutoff points; sensitivity 0.88 versus 0.88; specificity 0.64 versus 0.67; 70% versus 72% correctly classified. Moreover, both tests had similar discriminant indices in detecting impaired cognitive domains.CONCLUSIONS: Brief screening tests during acute admission in patients with mild stroke are predictive of significant vascular cognitive impairment 3-6 months after stroke."
"22490832","[Vascular risk factors and cognitive impairment of patients with magnetic resonance imaging-defined subcortical ischemic depression].","OBJECTIVE: To explore the vascular risk factors and neuropsychological profiles of patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-defined subcortical ischemic depression (SID).METHODS: Thirty-five SID patients, 37 patients with subcortical ischemic vascular disease without depression (SIVD) and 40 normal controls (NC) participated in this case-control study. The SID and SIVD groups were recruited from the Department of Neurology, First Affiliated Hospital, Anhui Medical University between October 2010 and September 2011. And the NC group came from Medical Center, First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University over the same period. The vascular risk factors of all participants were assessed by the Framingham scale. Depression symptoms were assessed by the geriatric depression scale (GDS) and Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) while cognitive functions by the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive clock drawing task (CDT).RESULTS: Both the SID (12.3 ± 4.7) and SIVD (13.5 ± 3.4) groups showed significantly higher Framingham scores than the NC group (8.6 ± 1.8) (F = 20.850, P = 0.000). Compared with the NC group (28.3 ± 1.8; 23.1 ± 3.4; 8.0 ± 1.8), the MMSE, MoCA and CDT scores were significantly lower in the SID (26.7 ± 2.5; 20.0 ± 4.0; 2.0 ± 2.7) and SIVD (26.8 ± 1.9; 20.7 ± 3.0; 6.1 ± 2.1) groups (P &lt; 0.05). There were significantly lower CAMCOG-C scores in the SID (82.7 ± 9.0) and SIVD (86.2 ± 6.9) groups versus the NC group (92.3 ± 6.2) (P &lt; 0.05) and similarly in the SID group versus the SIVD group (P &lt; 0.05). Among the subtests of CAMCOG-C, the orientation, language and memory scores in both SID (9.0 ± 1.4; 24.7 ± 4.0; 19.5 ± 3.4) and SIVD (9.4 ± 0.9; 25.5 ± 2.1; 20.3 ± 2.3) groups were significantly lower than those in the NC group (9.9 ± 0.4; 27.4 ± 1.9; 22.1 ± 2.4) (P &lt; 0.05); the praxis scores in the SID group (9.4 ± 1.9) were significantly lower than those in the NC group (10.4 ± 1.5) (P &lt; 0.05). And the thinking and perception scores in the SID group (5.4 ± 1.7; 6.3 ± 1.4) were significantly lower than those in the SIVD (6.2 ± 1.3; 7.0 ± 1.4) and NC (6.6 ± 1.3; 7.2 ± 1.4) groups. In the SID group, no significant correlation was found between the Framingham scores and neuropsychological assessments. There were a negative correlation between the GDS, HAMD scores and MMSE, MoCA, CAMCOG-C and CDT scores (P &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: The SID patients demonstrate multiple neuropsychological deficits, especially in thinking, perception and praxis. No significant correlation between vascular risk factors and depression symptoms is found in SID patients."
"22306380","Suitability of the Montreal cognitive assessment versus the mini-mental state examination in detecting vascular cognitive impairment.","The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) has been criticized as being an insufficient screening test for patients with vascular cognitive impairment because of its insensitivity to visuospatial and executive functional deficits. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was designed to be more sensitive to such deficits, and thus may be a superior screening instrument for vascular cognitive impairment. Twelve patients with extensive leukoaraiosis detected on magnetic resonance imaging (average age, 76.0 ± 8.7 years) underwent neurologic and cognitive testing, including MMSE and the Japanese version of the MoCA (MoCA-J). Accepted cutoff scores of &lt;27 for the MMSE and &lt;26 for the MoCA-J were taken to indicate cognitive impairment. Z-scores were calculated to evaluate the discriminating ability of individual MMSE and MoCA-J subtest scores. Although there was a strong correlation between the total MMSE and total MoCA-J scores (r = 0.90; P &lt; .0001), MMSE scores were skewed toward the higher end of the range (range, 18-30; median, 28), whereas MoCA-J scores were normally distributed (range, 9-28; median, 21). Of the 7 patients with an unimpaired MMSE score, 6 (86%) had an impaired MoCA-J score. Z-scores were &gt;5 for 4 MMSE subtests (orientation, registration, naming, and language) but for only 1 MoCA-J subtest (naming). The MoCA-J better discriminated cognitive status in subjects with extensive leukoaraiosis. Our findings suggest that the MoCA-J is more sensitive than the MMSE in screening for cognitive impairment in patients with subcortical vascular cognitive impairment. "
"22280947","Mini-Mental State Examination versus Montreal Cognitive Assessment: rapid assessment tools for cognitive and functional outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.","OBJECTIVE: Recent studies suggest that the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is more sensitive to stroke-associated cognitive dysfunction than the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), but little is known about how these screening measures relate to neurocognitive test performance or real-world functioning in patients with good recovery after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). The aim of the present study was to determine how MoCA and MMSE scores relate to neurocognitive impairment and return to work after aSAH.METHODS: Thirty-two patients with aSAH who had made a good recovery completed the MoCA, the MMSE, and a battery of neurocognitive tests.RESULTS: 42% and 0% of aSAH patients were impaired on the MoCA and MMSE, respectively. The MoCA had acceptable sensitivity (40-100%) and specificity (54-68%) (Table 3). The MMSE failed to detect impairment in any cognitive domain. The MoCA, but not the MMSE, predicted performance on tests of verbal learning, executive function, working memory, visuospatial function, and motor function. Superior performance on the Animal naming and Abstraction subtests of the MoCA score were associated with return to work following aSAH.CONCLUSION: Compared to the MMSE, the MoCA is more sensitive to aSAH-associated cognitive impairment. Certain MoCA subtests are also sensitive to functional difficulties after aSAH such as return to work. These findings support the utility of the MoCA as a brief bedside assessment of cognitive and real-world outcome in aSAH survivors."
"24335198","Brief screening for mild cognitive impairment in subcortical ischemic vascular disease: a comparison study of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment with the Mini-Mental State Examination.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To assess the validity of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in the detection of vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI) in patients with subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD).METHODS: Among 102 SIVD patients, both cutoff scores of the MMSE and MoCA for differentiating VaMCI from no cognitive impairment (NCI) or differentiating VaMCI from vascular dementia (VaD) were determined by the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. Optimal sensitivity with specificity of cutoff scores was obtained after the raw scores were adjusted for education.RESULTS: After adjusting for education, the MoCA cutoff score for differentiating VaMCI from NCI was at 24/25 and that for differentiating VaMCI from VaD was at 18/19. After applying the adjusted MoCA scores from 19 to 24 to identify VaMCI in all SIVD patients, sensitivity was at 76.7% and specificity was at 81.4% (<U+03BA> = 0.579). The adjusted cutoff score of the MMSE for differentiating VaMCI from NCI was at 28/29 and that for differentiating VaMCI from VaD was at 25/26. The sensitivity and specificity of the adjusted MMSE was at 58.1 and 71.2%, respectively, when using the score from 26 to 28 to identify VaMCI in SIVD patients (<U+03BA> = 0.294).CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA detected subcortical VaMCI better than the MMSE."
"24323708","Early MoCA-assessed cognitive impairment after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and relationship to 1-year functional outcome.","Recent clinical research into aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) has confirmed the long-term effect of cognitive dysfunction on functional outcomes. We hypothesized that early cognitive impairment was a marker of permanent brain injury and hence predicted long-term functional outcome. Hong Kong Chinese patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were evaluated prospectively by means of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in the subacute phase (2-4 weeks after aSAH) and by neuropsychological evaluation of functional outcomes in the chronic phase (1 year after aSAH). This multi-center prospective observational study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov of the US National Institutes of Health (NCT01038193). One hundred and eight patients completed both the subacute and chronic phase assessments. Cognitive dysfunction in the subacute phase independently correlated with functional outcomes at 1 year, after adjusting for age, admission clinical condition, treatment modality, motor score, and mobility in the subacute phase, but the positive predictive values remained low. MoCA-assessed cognitive impairment in the subacute phase cannot accurately predict functional outcomes at 1 year. Future study should focus on understanding the relative importance of different components of early cognitive impairment."
"24262447","Electroencephalogram beta power assay: a promising diagnosis tool of cognitive impairment in early time after cerebral hemorrhage.","BACKGROUND: Cerebral hemorrhage (CH) could affect the cerebral function on specific cognitive abilities and lead to the cognitive decline or cognitive dysfunction. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a relatively cheap and easy usable tool, which could reflect the cerebral function of the patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 170 patients (patients with and without cognitive impairment) with CH and 120 normal healthy controls were recruited from September 2008 to June 2012 at the Department of Neurology. EEG studies were carried out to analyze the cerebral function in all the subjects. Correlation, clustering and concordance analysis were performed to analyze the relationship between EEG power and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scores. The effects of EEG analysis were assessed to diagnosis the cognitive impairment.RESULTS: The results were showed that patients with cognitive impairment had a significantly decreased EEG beta power (0.771 ± 0.149 µV 2 ) compared with the normal cognitive function (1.654 ± 0.186 µV 2 , P &lt; 0.01) or normal healthy controls (1.703 ± 0.216 µV 2 , P &lt; 0.01). Significantly positive correlation (r = 0.90174, P &lt; 0.001) was discovered between relative beta power and hemorrhage type, while significantly negative correlations between the relative beta power and hemorrhage size and amount were also observed (r =-0.81235 and r =-0.90136, respectively, all P &lt; 0.001). There was a better concordance between K-means clustering algorithm calculating of the relative beta power and MoCA scores (<U+03BA> =0.913, P &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSION: The cognitive impairment post hemorrhage was positively correlated to hemorrhage type and negatively correlated with hemorrhage size and amount. The analysis method of EEG beta power abnormality holds a promise to assess the cognitive impairment post CH."
"24217342","Impact of different operational definitions on mild cognitive impairment rate and MMSE and MoCA performance in transient ischaemic attack and stroke.","BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is at least as prevalent as dementia after transient ischaemic attack (TIA)/stroke and is increasingly recognised as an important outcome in observational studies and randomised trials. However, there is no consensus on how impairment should be defined, and numerous different criteria exist. Previous studies have shown that different criteria for cognitive impairment impact on prevalence rates in epidemiological studies. However, there are few data on how operational differences within established criteria (e.g. Petersen-MCI) affect measured impairment rates and the performance of short cognitive tests such as the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), particularly in cerebrovascular disease. We therefore evaluated the effect of different operational definitions on measured rates of Petersen-MCI and on reliability of short cognitive tests in patients with TIA and stroke.METHODS: Consecutive patients underwent the MMSE, MoCA and neuropsychological battery =1 year after TIA or stroke in a population-based study. MCI was defined using the Petersen method and subclassified as single or multiple domain, both with (original) and without (modified) subjective memory impairment. Different cut-offs (&gt;1, &gt;1.5 and &gt;2 standard deviations, SD) on a given test relative to published norms were compared together with use of single versus multiple tests to define domain impairment.RESULTS: 91 non-demented subjects completed neuropsychological testing (mean age ± SD 69.7 ± 11.6 years, 54 male, 49 stroke) at a mean of 3.1 ± 1.9 years after the index event. Rates of cognitive impairment ranged from 14/91 (15%) for MCI-original at &gt;2 SD cut-off to 61/91 (67%) MCI-modified at &gt;1 SD cut-off, and the proportion of MCI that was multiple domain varied, e.g. 24/46 (52%) versus only 5/27 (20%) at 1 versus 2 SD cut-off for MCI-modified. Requirement for subjective memory complaint approximately halved estimates [e.g. 17 (19%) vs. 39 (43%) for MCI at 1.5 SD cut-off, single test definition], whereas use of multiple tests versus a single test to define a cognitive domain had less impact. In general, diagnostic accuracy was higher, and optimal cut-offs lower, on MMSE and MoCA for multiple-domain versus single-domain MCI, but the MoCA appeared superior for detecting MCI-modified, whereas the MMSE performed well in detecting MCI-original.CONCLUSION: Even within established criteria for MCI, differences in operational methodology result in 4-fold variation in MCI estimates. Optimal MMSE and MoCA cut-offs are lower, and reliability more similar, when criteria for MCI are more stringent. Our findings have implications for sample size and adjusted relative risk calculations in randomised trials and for comparisons between studies."

However, the neural mechanisms of the disorder remain unclear. The aim of this study was, using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), to detect microstructural changes in patients with symptomatic CAD presenting with TIA, and to explore their relationship with cognitive functions.METHODS: In all, 35 patients with right-sided CAD and ipsilateral TIA and 35 healthy controls were investigated using cognitive tests and voxel-based analysis (VBA) of DTI. The whole brain DTI parameters, fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), were calculate and compared between two groups. A correlation analysis was also performed to explore the relationship between cognitive test scores and whole brain FA and MD values in the patients.RESULTS: We observed two interesting findings. First, compared with the controls, the patients showed significantly increased MD in the right anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG) and decreased FA in the right amygdala. Second, the MD values in the right ACG were negatively correlated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in the patients.CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion tensor imaging parameters are altered in patients with CAD and ipsilateral TIA, which indicates the existence of microstructural abnormalities in the brain of the patients. The significant correlation between DTI abnormalities and cognition reveals the potential of DTI for investigating the pathophysiology mechanism related to the cognitive dysfunction of the disease."

The ReHo was calculated to assess the strength of the local signal synchrony and was compared between the two groups.RESULTS: Compared with the controls, the TIA patients exhibited a decreased ReHo in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), the right inferior prefrontal cortex (iPFC), the right ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) and the right dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (dPCC). In addition, the mean ReHo values in the right dlPFC and the right iPFC were significantly correlated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in TIA patients.CONCLUSIONS: Neural activities in the resting state are changed in TIA patients even without visible ischaemic lesions on conventional MRI. The positive correlation between the ReHo of resting-state fMRI and cognition suggests that ReHo could be a promising tool to observe the neurobiological consequences of TIA.SIGNIFICANCE: The present study revealed abnormal local synchronisation of spontaneous neural activities in patients with TIA."
"24051120","Polysomnographic abnormalities in patients with vascular cognitive impairment-no dementia.","OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate subjective sleep quality and polysomnographic sleep structure features in patients with vascular cognitive impairment-no dementia (VCIND).METHODS: Fifty-six patients with VCIND, 48 patients with simple stroke (without cognitive impairment), and 48 control subjects were included. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and polysomnography (PSG) were used to analyze their sleep characteristics. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was conducted to assess mental state.RESULTS: Patients with VCIND had higher PSQI scores compared with control subjects and simple stroke patients (P&lt;.01). PSG revealed that patients with VCIND or stroke were more likely to experience prolonged sleep latency (SL), decreased sleep efficiency (SE), increased arousal, and reduced deep sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep than controls. Patients with VCIND had significantly longer SL, increased periodic leg movements in sleep (PLMS), decreased SE, and increased arousal and sleep fragmentation compared to patients with simple stroke (P&lt;.05). In VCIND patients, a significant positive correlation was found between SE and MoCA scores (r=0.632; P&lt;.001), though PSQI, SL, and arousal index were significantly negatively associated with MoCA scores (r=-0.787, -0.740, -0.772, respectively; P&lt;.001 for all).CONCLUSIONS: VCIND patients had different abnormal sleep features, including decreased SE, increased PLMS, and prolonged SL and sleep fragmentation.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a noninvasive diagnostic tool for assessment of cerebral function. A total of 174 patients (including cognitively impaired and cognitively normal) with cerebral hemorrhage, and 120 healthy persons (CN), were recruited between August 2008 and July 2012 at the Department of Neurology. EEG was used to analyze cerebral function of patients and normal persons. Correlation, clustering and concordance analyses were performed to analyze the relationship between EEG power and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores.

"23988641","Test accuracy of short screening tests for diagnosis of delirium or cognitive impairment in an acute stroke unit setting.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Guidelines recommend cognitive screening in acute stroke. Various instruments are available, with no consensus on a preferred tool. We aimed to describe test accuracy of brief screening tools for diagnosis of cognitive impairment and delirium in acute stroke.METHODS: We collected data on sequential stroke unit admission in a single center. Four assessors trained in cognitive testing independently performed screening and reference tests. Brief assessments comprised the following: 10- and 4-point Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT-10; AMT-4); 4-A Test (4AT); Clock Drawing Test (CDT); Cog-4; and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). We also recorded the multidisciplinary team's informal review using single question (SQ). We compared against reference standards of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Confusion Assessment Method for delirium using usual diagnostic cutpoints. For MoCA, we described effects of lowering the diagnostic threshold to MoCA &lt;24 and MoCA &lt;20. We described sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values.RESULTS: Over a 10-week period, 111 subjects had cognitive assessment data. Subjects were 50% male (n=55), and median age was 74 years (interquartile range, 64-85). AMT-4, AMT-10, and SQ all had excellent (1.00) specificity for detection of cognitive impairment, although sensitivity was poor (all &lt;0.60). The 4AT had greatest sensitivity for detecting delirium (1.00 [confidence interval [CI], 0.74-1.00]) and reasonable specificity (0.82 [CI, 0.72-0.89]). Properties of 4AT for detection of cognitive impairment, at the traditional MoCA threshold, were also good (sensitivity, 0.86; specificity, 0.78). Using diagnostic thresholds of MoCA =26, &lt;24, and &lt;20 gave proportions with cognitive impairments of 86%, 61%, and 49%, respectively, with resulting changes in screening test properties. At lower MoCA thresholds, CDT had favorable sensitivity and specificity (MoCA &lt;20: sensitivity, 0.93, specificity, 0.66; MoCA &lt;24: sensitivity, 0.85, specificity, 0.77).CONCLUSIONS: Many brief screening assessments are specific but not sensitive for detection of cognitive impairment in acute stroke. Our primary analysis suggests that 4AT is a reasonable choice for delirium and cognitive screening in this setting. However, these data are based on standard MoCA diagnostic threshold and may not be suited for an acute stroke population."
"23920318","Validity and applications of the Montreal cognitive assessment for the assessment of vascular cognitive impairment.","Cognitive impairment is common among patients with stroke or other cerebrovascular disease and influences long-term outcome, including occupational functioning. Recognition and monitoring of mild cognitive impairment is thus essential to good patient care. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has been suggested as a brief screening test of vascular cognitive impairment. This paper presents a critical review of the research literature evaluating the validity and utility of this test with the aim of informing future clinical and research practice. A total of 30 papers employing the MoCA in the context of cerebrovascular disease were identified. Reporting of the methods and results of such studies tended to fall short of the established reporting guidelines. Under-specification of the exclusion criteria applied and their impact make it difficult to assess the potential impact of sampling bias and loss to follow-up. Nevertheless, content validity evidence suggests that the MoCA covers most of the domains that represent cognitive impairment in cerebrovascular disease, with mixed evidence for its preferential sensitivity to the type of cognitive impairment encountered in the context of vascular disease. Evidence clearly supports the need to establish norms and cut-offs for the MoCA that are culturally appropriate and that are matched to the range of cognitive impairment that is present in the population being assessed. Recent modifications of the MoCA have been developed for assessing patients with visual impairment or restricted mobility, which may reduce the impact of 'untestability' on cognitive screening in the clinic or research context. The MoCA correlates well with other measures of cognitive and functional abilities in patients with cerebrovascular disease, and may also predict future response to rehabilitation and long-term occupational outcome. Further research is needed to provide evidence for the validity of the MoCA in longitudinal studies. However, it compares favourably to the Mini Mental State Examination as a screening test that is sensitive to the milder forms of cognitive impairment that often accompany cerebrovascular disease."
"23900081","Vascular cognitive impairment: most useful subtests of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in minor stroke and transient ischemic attack.","AIMS: Cognitive impairment is frequent in cerebrovascular disease but often remains undetected. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has been proposed in this context. Our aim was to evaluate the MoCA and its subtests in cerebrovascular disease.METHODS: We assessed 386 consecutive patients with minor stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Score &lt;4) or transient ischemic attack at 3 months. The MoCA and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were administered. Computed tomography (CT) scans were assessed for stroke and white matter changes. An unfavorable functional outcome was defined as mRS &gt;1.RESULTS: The prevalence of cognitive impairment (cutoff of 26) was 55% using the MoCA and 13% using the MMSE. In a multivariate analysis, MoCA &lt;26 was associated with the outcome (OR 3.00, CI 1.78-5.03), as were remote lacunar stroke on CT and white matter changes of at least moderate severity. Five subtests (5-word recall, word list generation, trail-making, abstract reasoning and cube copy) formed an optimal short MoCA with 6/10 or less showing a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 83%.CONCLUSION: This study extends the utility of the MoCA to milder forms of cerebrovascular disease. The MoCA is associated with the 3-month functional outcome. Five subtests may constitute an optimal brief tool in vascular cognitive impairment."
"23891119","The effects of educational background on Montreal Cognitive Assessment screening for vascular cognitive impairment, no dementia, caused by ischemic stroke.","It is possible that a patient's educational background has an effect on their Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score, which is used to evaluate patients for vascular cognitive impairment, no dementia (VCIND) after ischemic stroke. Cognitive impairment was evaluated in patients with no cognitive impairment (NCI) or VCIND using the MoCA. The receiver operating characteristic curve and maximal Youden index were used to determine the optimal cut-off values to distinguish between NCI and VCIND. The sensitivity and specificity of MoCA were calculated for patients with primary, secondary and tertiary educational levels. Patients with NCI (n=111) and VCIND (n=95) were tested. In patients with a primary education, a significant difference was found between the two groups in each of the MoCA factors, except for naming. Likewise, a significant difference was found in all factors, except for naming, attention and calculation, for patients with a secondary education. For the patients with a tertiary education, a significant difference was found only in visuospatial/executive abilities, abstraction and memory (p&lt;0.05). The optimal cut-off value for MoCA in order to identify VCIND was 22-23. MoCA showed an overall sensitivity of 65.26% and specificity of 78.73%. The sensitivity in the primary, secondary and tertiary educated groups was 97.06%, 56.10% and 40%, respectively, with the specificity being 47.22%, 87.80% and 100%, respectively. We suggest that the MoCA score needs to be amended according to the patient's educational levels in order to improve the effectiveness of the screening."

We therefore compared cognitive outcomes in ACS with transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and minor stroke, diseases with similar risk factor burden generally considered to be at high risk of cognitive decline.DESIGN: Prospective population based cohort studySETTING: Oxford Vascular Study (OXVASC) carried out within a defined population of 91 000 in Oxfordshire, UK.PATIENTS: 614 in total: 216 ACS, 182 TIA, 216 minor (non-disabling) stroke.OUTCOME MEASURES: Mini-Mental-State-Examination (MMSE), Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-modified (TICSm), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at 1 and 5 years.RESULTS: Overall risk factor burden was similar across groups but ACS patients had more smoking (27% vs 14%, p&lt;0.001) and less hypertension (45% vs 53%, p&lt;0.01) and atrial fibrillation (6% vs 14%, p&lt;0.001). Cognitive outcomes were worse at 1 year in ACS versus TIA patients: mean±SD MMSE 26.6±2.7 vs 27.6±2.5, p&lt;0.0001; OR=2.14, 95% CI 1.11 to 4.13 for moderate/severe cognitive impairment (MMSE &lt;24) with a similar trend at 5 years, and ACS outcomes were more similar to minor stroke. Memory and language versus frontal/executive subtests were relatively more impaired in ACS than TIA and minor stroke patients.CONCLUSIONS: Risk of cognitive impairment after ACS is similar to minor stroke and higher than TIA with implications for clinical practice including consent and adherence with medication. Differences in cognitive domain performance suggest a greater role for degenerative brain pathology in ACS which may be linked to vascular risk profile and cardiac factors."

The average BMI was 30.5<U+2009>±<U+2009>6. The mean diameter of the great saphenous vein in the upper thigh was 7.3<U+2009>mm and the mean treatment length was 38<U+2009>cm. Adjunctive treatment of the varicosities was performed in 11% of patients during the procedure. Closure rates were 100% at one week, 98% at three months, and 94% at six months. Post-procedure complications included hematoma 1%, ecchymosis 9%, and thrombophlebitis 10%. There were no cases of venous thromboembolism. There was significant improvement in VCSS (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) for all time intervals.CONCLUSION: MOCA of the saphenous veins has the advantage of endovenous ablation without tumescent anesthesia, making it an almost pain-free procedure. High occlusion rates with significant clinical improvement can be achieved with this method at short term."
"23816457","Cognitive impairment and antiphospholipid syndrome: is paradoxical embolism the rule?","OBJECTIVE: Although cognitive decline (CD) is described in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), its physiopathology is unknown. Paradoxical embolization (PE) is related to CD in Alzheimer disease. The objective of this study was to determine whether PE plays a role in CD in APS patients through a significant right-to-left shunt (sRLS).METHODS: A total of 27 patients diagnosed with APS without a history of stroke were tested for the presence of an sRLS using a contrast-enhanced transcranial Doppler (cTCD) ultrasound. Cognitive decline was assessed using the mini mental state examination (MMSE), the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), and a battery of neuropsychological tests.RESULTS: Of the 27 patients, 19 (70%) had a non-sRLS condition (= 10 high-intensity transient signs [HITS] on cTCD), and 8 (30%) had an sRLS. Patients with more than 10 years of scholarship performed significantly better on both the MMSE (P = 0.048) and MoCA (P = 0.03). Individuals of the non-sRLS group with more than 10 years of scholarship had better performances on the five-point test (FPT) when compared with the sRLS group (P = 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Patients without sRLS and with more years of education exhibited a better performance in cognitive tests than sRLS patients."
"23738569","Predictors of early post ischemic stroke apathy and depression: a cross-sectional study.","BACKGROUND: Apathy and depression are important neuropsychiatric disorders that can occur after a stroke but the etiology and risk factors are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for apathy and depression following a stroke.METHODS: Patients with an acute stroke who met the inclusion criteria were recruited from our hospital, and general information was recorded from patient charts. The Apathy Evaluation Scale, Clinician Version (AES-C) was used to evaluate these patients within 2 weeks after the stroke. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), Mattis Dementia Rating Scale Initiation/Perseveration subset (MDRS I/P), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) and Stroop Color-Word Association Test were employed to evaluate emotion, cognitive function and executive function. The patients were divided into two groups: the apathy group and the non-apathy group. We also divided the patients into two groups based on whether or not they had post-stroke depression. The clinical characteristics and scores on the MoCA, MMSE, HAMD and MDRS I/P were compared between the apathy and non-apathy groups as well as between patients with and without depression. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for apathy and depression following a stroke.RESULTS: A total of 75 patients with acute stroke were recruited. Of these, 25 (33.3%) developed apathy and 12 (16%) developed depression. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that a history of cerebrovascular disease (OR: 6.45, 95% CI: 1.48-28.05, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.013), low HbA1c (OR: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.12-0.81, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.017) and a low MDRS I/P score (OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.74, 0.96, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.010) were risk factors for post-stroke apathy. Additionally, multivariate logistic regression indicated that a low MDRS I/P (OR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.75, 0.97, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.015) was associated with post-stroke depression.CONCLUSIONS: Three risk factors for post-stroke apathy were identified as a history of cerebrovascular disease, low HbA1c and lower MDRS I/P scores. A low MDRS I/P score was also identified as a risk factor for post-stroke depression. These results may be useful to clinicians in recognizing and treating apathy and depression in patients after a stroke."
"23716072","Predictive value of MoCA in the acute phase of stroke on the diagnosis of mid-term cognitive impairment.","Post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) includes all forms of cognitive decline that develop after stroke, even if not severe enough to fit the criteria of dementia. Our aims were to investigate the predictive value of a brief bedside examination (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA) in the acute phase of stroke on the diagnosis of mid-term PSCI, taking into account other clinical, cognitive, functional, and neuroimaging predictors. Consecutive patients admitted to a stroke unit were evaluated with MoCA between 5 and 9 days after stroke. At baseline, clinical, functional, and neuroimaging data were collected. Patients were reassessed between 6 and 9 months after stroke by means of an extensive neuropsychological and functional evaluation. Out of 137 enrolled stroke patients, 80 (58.4%) were followed up (mean age 68.2 ± 14.6 years, males 66%, mean NIHSS score 3.6 ± 4.8). PSCI was diagnosed in 47 patients (59%; 35 mild cognitive impairment, 12 dementia). Controlling for age, education, functional and cognitive pre-morbid status, stroke severity, and pre-existing lacunar infarcts, MoCA baseline score [OR (95% CI) = 1.4(1.1-1.8)] for each point] and leukoaraiosis severity [OR (95% CI) = 0.4(0.2-0.9)] for each point of the van Swieten scale] were independently associated with PSCI. Using a ROC analysis, a cut-off of 21 predicted the diagnosis of PSCI with 91.4 % sensitivity, 75.8 % specificity, 80 % positive predictive value, and 89.3 % negative predictive value. In a sample of mild stroke patients, MoCA seems to be a good predictor of mid-term PSCI, making it a possible candidate for a brief cognitive screening in the acute stroke setting."
"23712181","Cognitive assessment in proximity to acute ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack: comparison of the montreal cognitive assessment test and mindstreams computerized cognitive assessment battery.","AIMS: Even mild stroke survivors may sometimes experience residual cognitive damage. No consensus has emerged about which cognitive test is most appropriate for the diagnosis of poststroke cognitive impairment. We aim to compare a computerized battery of neuropsychological tests for memory, attention and executive functions (MindStreams®) with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to detect mild-to-moderate cognitive impairments in poststroke patients.METHODS: Subjects enrolled to the TABASCO (Tel Aviv Brain Acute Stroke Cohort) study, a prospective study which includes consecutive first-ever mild-to-moderate stroke patients, were included. All participants underwent neurological and cognitive evaluations.RESULTS: A total of 454 patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke are reported. Their mean MoCA and MindStreams scores were lower than normal; however, the TIA group presented significantly better scores using either method. The correlation between the MoCA and the computerized global score was 0.6 (p &lt; 0.001). A significant correlation was found between the subcategory scores (executive function, memory and attention). However, the MoCA identified many more subjects with low scores (&lt;26) compared to the MindStreams (70.6 vs. 15.7%).CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that either of the modalities alone is sensitive enough for identifying subtle cognitive impairment and none picks up substantially more cognitive losses than the other in patients with cerebrovascular disease."
"23676378","Relationship between EEG beta power abnormality and early diagnosis of cognitive impairment post cerebral hemorrhage.","Cerebral hemorrhage is a common disease of older adults, which could increase the risk of cognitive impairment. Electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics can be analyzed to investigate the applied value in the assessment of cognitive impairment of the patients with cerebral hemorrhage. One hundred eighty-two patients (including patients with cognitive impairment [CHCI] and patients with cognitive normality [CHNC] with cerebral hemorrhage, and 120 normal healthy persons [control; CN]) were recruited between July 2008 to March 2012 at the department of neurology. All patients were analyzed by EEG, and analysis results were compared to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale, using the methods of correlation analysis, clustering analysis, and concordance analysis. The results indicated that patients with CHCI had significantly lower EEG beta power (0.814 ± 0.113 mcV(2)) relative to CHNC (1.601 ± 0.186 mcV(2), P &lt; .01) or CN group (1.713 ± 0.201 mcV(2), P &lt; .01). Significant negative correlation was found between the beta power and hemorrhage region, age, hemorrhage size, hemorrhage amount (r 1 = -.92223, r 2 = -.81084, r 3 = -.79258, r 4 = -.84961, respectively, all P &lt; .001). There was good concordance between K-means clustering algorithm calculating the beta power and MoCA scoring (Kappa = 0.899, P &lt; .001). In conclusion, the preliminary findings suggest that the recognition techniques of EEG hold considerable promise for the assessment of cognitive impairment post cerebral hemorrhage, which negatively related to the hemorrhage region, hemorrhage size, hemorrhage amount, and age.

"23637698","Reliability, validity, and optimal cutoff score of the montreal cognitive assessment (changsha version) in ischemic cerebrovascular disease patients of hunan province, china.","AIMS: The goal of this study was to examine the reliability and validity of the Changsha version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-CS) in ischemic cerebrovascular disease patients of Hunan Province, China, and to explore the optimal cutoff score for detecting vascular cognitive impairment-no dementia (VCI-ND) and vascular dementia (VD).METHODS: Three hundred and thirty-eight ischemic cerebrovascular disease patients (131 with normal cognition, 111 with VCI-ND, and 96 with VD) and 132 healthy controls were recruited. All participants accepted examination by the MoCA-CS, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and other related scales. A detailed neuropsychological battery was used for making a final cognitive diagnosis. SPSS 16.0 statistical software was used for reliability, validity examination, and optimal cutoff score detection.RESULTS: Cronbach's a of the MoCA-CS was 0.884, and test-retest and interrater reliability of the MoCA-CS were 0.966 and 0.926, respectively. MoCA-CS scores were highly correlated with MMSE scores (r = 0.867) and simplified intelligence quotients (r = 0.822). The results indicate that 1 point should be added for subjects with less than 6 years of education, and that the optimal cutoff score for detecting VCI-ND is 26/27 (sensitivity 96.1%, specificity 75.6%), whereas the optimal cutoff score for detecting VD is 16/17 (sensitivity 92.7%, specificity 96.3%).CONCLUSION: The MoCA-CS has good reliability and validity, and is a useful cognitive screening instrument for detecting VCI in the Chinese population."
"23577654","Assessment of cognitive function in adult patients with hemorrhagic moyamoya disease who received no surgical revascularization.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Due to controversial surgical treatment for hemorrhagic moyamoya disease (MMD), a large proportion of these patients chose conservative treatment. The aim of this study was to assess cognitive function in adult patients with hemorrhagic MMD who received no surgical revascularization.METHODS: Twenty-six adult hemorrhagic MMD patients with only intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) confirmed by positive computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scan, 20 patients with spontaneous IVH whose digital subtraction angiography results were negative, and 30 healthy controls were identified and matched for age, gender, education background and living area. Cognitive function was evaluated by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The non-parametric test was used for comparisons among the three groups.RESULTS: No patient was confirmed cognitive dysfunction at the initial screening. Twenty-four (92%) cases presented mild cognitive impairment (MCI) after 1 year. All the cases demonstrated MCI after 2 years. The difference between cases and healthy controls was statistically significant at the second screening (P = 0.000) and the third screening (P = 0.000), as was that between cases and patients with spontaneous IVH at the second screening (P = 0.000) and the third screening (P = 0.000). In addition, there were significant decreases in all MoCA subscores (P = 0.000) with special regards to delayed recall, visual space and executive function in cases compared with the other two groups. Moreover, significant differences were found in the subgroups of smoking (P = 0.021) and Suzuki angiographic classification of MMD (P = 0.030).CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairment is a long-term complication for adult hemorrhagic MMD patients who underwent conservative treatment."
"23548916","The NeuroAiD II (MLC901) in vascular cognitive impairment study (NEURITES).","BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of patients after nondisabling stroke are cognitively impaired compared to age- and education-matched community-dwelling controls. Moreover, poststroke patients who have 'vascular cognitive impairment no dementia' (VCIND) of moderate severity have a high risk of incident dementia, dependency and death. Further studies are urgently needed to demonstrate effective cognition-enhancing therapies in VCIND given the scarcity of evidence-based treatment options. NeuroAiD is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been shown to induce neuroplasticity, promote cell proliferation and stimulate the development of dense axonal and dendritic networks in animal stroke models. NeuroAiD may improve cerebral blood flow and functional recovery after stroke in patients.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects and tolerability of NeuroAiD II in patients with VCIND.METHODS: The NeuroAiD II (MLC901) in Vascular Cognitive Impairment Study (NEURITES) is a 24-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase II study of NeuroAiD II in patients with VCIND. The primary outcome is executive function as measured by the Verbal Fluency test. Secondary outcomes include cognitive assessments such as the ADAS-Cog, MoCA, MMSE and Cognitive Battery: activities of daily living as measured by the Alzhei-mer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scale for mild cognitive impairment, behavior as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and depression as measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale and the Beck Depression Scale. In addition, there will be novel exploratory outcomes: (a) magnetic resonance imaging of lesion location (structural imaging), structural integrity of white matter pathways (diffusion tensor imaging), neuronal function (resting studies) and perfusion (arterial spin labeling and MR angiography), and (b) retinal and optic nerve imaging. Safety and tolerability will be assessed using adverse events, laboratory tests and vital signs.CONCLUSIONS: NEURITES has the potential to set new standards for the systematic evaluation of Asian traditional medicine for integration into standard medicine practice and establishing a novel therapeutic approach for improving cognition after stroke."
"23573223","Comparison of montreal cognitive assessment and mini-mental state examination in evaluating cognitive domain deficit following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.","OBJECTIVE: Cognitive deficits are common after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH), and clinical evaluation is important for their management. Our hypothesis was that the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCa) is superior to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in screening for cognitive domain deficit in aSAH patients.METHODS: We carried out a prospective observational and diagnostic accuracy study on Hong Kong aSAH patients aged 21 to 75 years who had been admitted within 96 hours of ictus. The domain-specific neuropsychological assessment battery, the MoCA and MMSE were administered 2-4 weeks and 1 year after ictus. A cognitive domain deficit was defined as a cognitive domain z score &lt;-1.65 (below the fifth percentile). Cognitive impairment was defined as two or more cognitive domain deficits. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov of the US National Institutes of Health (NCT01038193).RESULTS: Both the MoCA and the MMSE were successful in differentiating between patients with and without cognitive domain deficits and cognitive impairment at both assessment periods. At 1 year post-ictus, the MoCA produced higher area under the curve scores for cognitive impairment than the MMSE (MoCA, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.97 versus MMSE, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.83, p = 0.009).INTERPRETATION: Cognitive domain deficits and cognitive impairment in patients with aSAH can be screened with the MoCA in both the subacute and chronic phases."
"23569023","Relationship between cerebral microbleeds and cognitive function in lacunar infarct.","OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the impact of cerebral microbleeds on cognitive function. This study investigated the distribution of cerebral microbleeds and their impact on cognitive function, in patients with lacunar infarct.METHODS: Patients with lacunar infarct were enrolled prospectively. Cerebral microbleeds were classified as absent, mild, moderate or severe, based on magnetic resonance imaging findings. Cognitive function was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) questionnaire, with a total score of &lt;26 indicating cognitive impairment.RESULTS: Of the 85 patients included in the study, 35 (41.2%) had cerebral microbleeds. They were more frequently observed in mixed and deep brain regions, but rarely in the cerebral lobes. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that presence of cerebral microbleeds (odds ratio [OR] 5.320), duration of education (OR 0.938) and age (OR 1.464) were independent predictors of cognitive impairment. There was a significant correlation between cerebral microbleed severity and MoCA score.CONCLUSION: The number and location of cerebral microbleeds were both closely associated with cognitive impairment, in patients with lacunar infarct."
"23564547","Cognitive decline and cerebral vasoreactivity in asymptomatic patients with severe internal carotid artery stenosis.","The aim of the study was to correlate cognitive decline and cerebral vasoreactivity in 150 asymptomatic right-handed patients with severe =70% unilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis and to evaluate the role of intracranial collateral circulation during cognitive testing. Cognitive assessment was performed by means of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) scales. Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and intracranial collateral circulation were evaluated by means of breath holding index (BHI) and transcranial color Doppler (TCD) sonography. The results were compared with 150 right-handed controls matched for demographic variables and vascular risk factors. Patients with severe unilateral ICA stenosis had MMSE scores within a normal range, but MoCA scores were lower than normal. By examining the side of the observed stenosis, it has been noted that patients with left-sided ICA stenosis had lower MoCA scores in categories of language and episodic memory performance, while patients with right-sided ICA stenosis had lower MoCA scores in a category of visual-spatial skills. All patients had BHI values lower than normal. Subjects with a single intracranial collateral artery recruited had slightly better cognitive results than the patients with two or more collateral arteries activated. Results of the study showed that altered cerebrovascular reactivity and cerebral hypoperfusion might be responsible for the reduction of specific cognitive functions ipsilateral to the ICA stenosis, therefore BHI and MoCA might be useful tools when screening for cognitive decline in asymptomatic patients with severe ICA stenosis."
"23561248","The relationship between cognitive impairment and cerebral blood flow changes after transient ischaemic attack.","OBJECTIVE: The associations between cognitive impairment following the initial onset of transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and the parameters of altered cerebral blood flow and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HsCRP) level are unclear.METHODS: A total of 97 first-time TIA patients aged 69.94 ± 4.02 years (38-75 years; M:F, 50:47) hospitalized between March 2010 and July 2011 were compared to 100 healthy control patients aged 66.56 ± 12.15 years (45-80 years; M:F, 60:40). Cognitive function was quantified by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Intracranial blood flow was measured using transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and HsCRP levels were assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. Relationships between both values and MoCA scores were examined.RESULTS: Transient ischaemic attack patients exhibited declined cognitive function manifested as impaired verbal fluency (97.93%), memory recall (91.75%), abstraction (84.53%), and visuospatial/executive abilities (79.38%). To a lesser degree, TIA patients also evidenced abnormalities in attention (50.52%), naming (20.62%), and orientation (20.62%). Furthermore, MoCA scores significantly correlated with high HsCRP levels and low vascular systolic peak velocities (P&lt;0.001). Vascular systolic peak velocities were high in nine patients (9.23%) and low in 57 patients (58.76%). Thus, cognitive impairment was closely related to HsCRP levels and intracranial blood flow velocities.CONCLUSION: Post-TIA cognitive impairment may result from atherosclerosis and reduced blood flow to the brain. Cognitive impairment, transcranial Doppler-visualized changes, and elevated HsCRP levels are important diagnostic indicators of TIA. Markers provided by cognitive evaluation of TIA patients following the initial onset of TIA may allow clinicians to better predict and prevent adverse vascular events."
"23524496","Executive dysfunction in patients with cerebral hypoperfusion after cerebral angiostenosis/occlusion.","Impairment of executive functions (EFs) was investigated in patients with cerebral hypoperfusion after cerebral angiostenosis/occlusion. Several EFs were measured in patients with cerebral angiostenosis/occlusion and healthy subjects. The vascular conditions, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV), mean transit time (MTT), time to peak (TTP), and delay time were assessed. The scores of the vascular stenosis/occlusion group were significantly lower than those of the control group. rCBV and rCBF were negatively correlated with the error response times in the Stroop test, and the persistent error responses in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) were positively correlated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores. TTP was positively correlated with the reaction and error reaction times, and the persistent error response in WCST was negatively correlated with the times of sorting in WCST and MoCA scores. MTT was positively correlated with the persistent error response in WCST. In the Stroop test, delay time was positively correlated with response time, and negatively correlated with error response times, and the persistent error response in WCST and MoCA scores. Patients with cerebral hypoperfusion after cerebral angiostenosis/occlusion had executive dysfunctions in working memory, sustained attention, response inhibition, cognitive flexibility, thought organization, planning, and implementation. Moreover, their executive dysfunctions were related with the decline in rCBF and rCBV. The prolonged TTP, MTT, and delay time suggested a slow blood flow and the poor compensation of collateral circulation, resulting in impairment of the EFs."

However, it has not been validated for use on traumatic brain injury patients with intracranial haemorrhage (tICH). The aim was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the MoCA (MoCA) in such patients.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHOD: A cross-sectional observational study was carried out on 40 controls and 48 tICH patients recruited in Hong Kong. Concurrent validity was assessed by a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Criterion validity was assessed by the differentiation of tICH patients from controls.MAIN OUTCOME AND RESULTS: In tICH patients, cognitive z-scores (ß<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.579; p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) and MMSE (ß<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.366, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.012) significantly correlated with performance in the MoCA after adjustment for age, gender and total score for the Geriatric Depressive Scale. For the differentiation of tICH patients from controls, analysis of receiver operating characteristics curves in the MoCA revealed an optimal balance of sensitivity and specificity at 25/26 with an area under the curve of 0.704 (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001). MoCA is applicable to and significantly correlated with excellent neurological outcomes in tICH patients.CONCLUSIONS: MoCA is a useful and psychometrically valid tool for the assessment of gross cognitive function in tICH patients."
"23425001","Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Mini-Mental State Examination are both valid cognitive tools in stroke.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the validity of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) as screening tools for cognitive impairment after stroke.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cognitive assessments were administered over 2 sessions (1 week apart) at 3 months post-stroke. Scores on the MoCA and MMSE were evaluated against a diagnosis of cognitive impairment derived from a comprehensive neuropsychological battery (the criterion standard).RESULTS: Sixty patients participated in the study [mean age 72.1 years (SD = 13.9), mean education 10.5 years (SD = 3.9), median acute NIHSS score 5 (IQR 3-7)]. The MoCA yielded lower scores (median = 21, IQR = 17-24; mean = 20.0, SD = 5.4) than the MMSE (median = 26, IQR = 22-27; mean = 24.2, SD = 4.5). MMSE data were more skewed towards ceiling than MoCA data (skewness = -1.09 vs -0.73). Area under the receiver operator curve was higher for MoCA than for MMSE (0.87 vs 0.84), although this difference was not significant (<U+03C7>(2) = 0.48, P = 0.49). At their optimal cut-offs, the MoCA had better sensitivity than the MMSE (0.92 vs 0.82) but poorer specificity (0.67 vs 0.76).CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA is a valid screening tool for post-stroke cognitive impairment; it is more sensitive but less specific than the MMSE. Contrary to the prevailing view, the MMSE also exhibited acceptable validity in this setting."
"23419567","Screening for cognitive impairment in a stroke prevention clinic using the MoCA.","BACKGROUND: Screening for cognitive impairment is recommended in patients with cerebrovascular disease. We sought to establish the incidence of cognitive impairment using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in a cohort of consecutive patients attending our stroke prevention clinic (SPC), and to determine whether a subset of the MoCA could be derived for use in this busy clinical setting.METHODS: The MoCA was administered to 102 patients. Incidence of cognitive impairment was compared to presenting complaint and final diagnosis. extent of cerebral white matter changes (WMC) was rated using the Age Related White Matter Changes (ARWMC) scale in 80 patients who underwent neuroimaging. A subset of the three most predictive test elements of the MoCA was derived using regression analysis.RESULTS: 63.7% of patients scored &lt;26/30 on the MoCA, in keeping with cognitive impairment. This was unrelated to the final diagnosis or extent of WMC, although a trend for lower MoCA scores was observed in older patients. A mini-MoCA subscore combining the clock drawing test, five-word delayed recall, and abstraction was highly correlated with the final MoCA score (R=0.901). A score of &lt;7/10 using this 10-point mini-MoCA identified cognitive impairment as defined by the MoCA with a sensitivity of 98.5%, and a specificity of 77.6%.CONCLUSIONS: Two-thirds of SPC patients demonstrated evidence for cognitive impairment, irrespective of their final diagnosis or the presence of WMC. A mini-MoCA comprised of the clock drawing test, five-word delayed recall, and abstraction represents a potential alternative to the full MoCA in this population."
"23292208","Factors predicting the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) applicability and performances in a stroke unit.","The evaluation of cognitive status is not routine in the acute stroke setting. We aimed to investigate feasibility, applicability, and performances of the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) in acute stroke patients. Consecutive stroke patients (ischemic or hemorrhagic) admitted to one stroke unit were evaluated 5-9 days after stroke with MoCA (score range: 0-30; higher scores indicate better cognitive performance). Pre-morbid functional and cognitive status was assessed by a structured interview to caregivers. Neuroimaging data regarding index stroke and pre-existing lesions were collected. From December 2009 to December 2010, out of 207 patients with stroke, 137 (66%) were enrolled [mean age 69.2 ± 14.8 years; males 62%; mean National Institute of Health and Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score 5.9 ± 7.9]. The most common reason for non-enrolment was unfitting the time window inclusion criteria. MoCA was entirely applicable to 113/137 (82.5%) patients and the mean score was 17.8 ± 7.1. Multivariate analyses showed that non-applicability was associated with higher NIHSS scores [OR (95% CI) = 1.4 (1.2-1.7) for each point], left sided lesions [OR (95% CI) = 18.8 (2.3-155.2)], and worse pre-morbid functional status [OR (95% CI) = 0.7 (0.6-0.9) for each point of the instrumental activity of daily living scale]. Factors influencing MoCA performance were low education (ß = 0.264, p &lt; 0.01), higher NIHSS scores (ß = -0.277, p &lt; 0.01) and worse pre-morbid functional status (ß = 0.504, p &lt; 0.001). MoCA administration is feasible in acute patients with mild-to-moderate stroke, with lesion location, stroke severity, and pre-morbid functional status as major determinants of its applicability and performance. MoCA seems to reveal some degree of cognitive deficit even in patients with mild stroke."
"23290422","Cognitive impairments in patients with cerebrovascular risk factors: a comparison of Mini Mental Status Exam and Montreal Cognitive Assessment.","OBJECTIVE AND BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that cerebrovascular risk factors are contributing factors, not only to vascular cognitive decline, but also for Alzheimer's disease. The study aim was to compare Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and MMSE tests in subjects with cerebrovascular risk factors.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty patients with cerebrovascular risk factors were administrated the MMSE and MoCA tests. Data collected for all subjects and the results were compared.RESULTS: Cognitive impairments revealed on both tests were more frequent in females, and correlated with the level of education (for MoCA r=0.75, p=0.001 and for MMSE r=0.662, p=0.001). Mean values of MoCA score were significantly lower in patients with two or more cerebrovascular risk factors compared with those with only one risk factor (19.92±5.99 versus 23.81±4.06; p=0.049), a finding that was not evidenced by MMSE.CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent impaired domain in MMSE (for scores both less and more than 26) was attention; but in MoCA the most frequent impaired domains were delayed recall (for scores above 26), and visuo-executive (for scores=26), which is a common domain involved in vascular cognitive decline. MoCA may be superior to MMSE in early detection of cognitive decline in patients with vascular risk factors."
"25495425","Multiple tooth loss is associated with vascular cognitive impairment in subjects with acute ischemic stroke.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Emerging evidence shows that tooth loss is associated with cognitive impairment and dementia. Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is a common consequence of ischemic stroke. This study investigated the association of tooth loss with VCI in patients with acute stroke.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 161 subjects with acute ischemic stroke were recruited. Within 1 wk after admission, fasting blood tests were undertaken and the number of teeth present was recorded. VCI was evaluated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).RESULTS: The patients with loss of = 8 teeth exhibited significantly lower MoCA values as compared to those with loss of = 7 teeth (13.2 ± 6.6 vs. 17.3 ± 6.0, p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that loss of = 8 teeth (OR = 3.1, 95% CI: 1.2-7.9, p = 0.02) and stroke history (OR = 3.8, 95% CI: 1.1-14.1, p = 0.04) were significantly associated with VCI (MoCA score = 20.0).CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this study, the current findings provide the first evidence that multiple tooth loss is independently associated with VCI in patients with acute ischemic stroke."
"25433800","Effects of differences in serum total homocysteine, folate, and vitamin B12 on cognitive impairment in stroke patients.","BACKGROUND: Vascular cognitive impairment-no dementia (VCIND) refers to the early or mild cognitive impairment induced by cerebral vascular injury. Research shows that serum total homocysteine (tHcy) level is an independent risk factor for cerebral vascular disease and may be closely related to cognitive function.Current studies on the tHcy level in VCIND patients are limited, and the relationship of tHcy with cognitive function remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the tHcy levels in patients with VCIND and to determine their correlation with cognitive function, as well as to provide useful clues for preventing and treating VCIND.METHODS: The tHcy, folate, and vitamin B12 levels in 82 patients with VCIND were reviewed retrospectively and compared with those of 80 stroke patients without cognitive impairment and 69 healthy controls by using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale and the event-related potential P300 to evaluate cognitive function.RESULTS: The tHcy levels in the VCIND group were higher than those in the other two groups, whereas the folate and Vitamin B12 levels in the VCIND group were lower than those of the other two groups. The tHcy levels in the stroke group were higher than those in the control group, and the folate and vitamin B12 levels in the stroke group were lower than those in the control group. The patients in the VCIND group with high tHcy exhibited lower MoCA scores and prolonged P300 latency than those in with normal tHcy. Correlation analysis showed that tHcy level is positively correlated with P300 latency period and negatively correlated with MoCA score.CONCLUSION: The tHcy levels were significantly higher and the vitamin B12 and folate levels were significantly lower in the patients with VCIND than those in the other groups. The high tHcy levels in the VCIND patients may be correlated with impaired cognitive function."
"25395414","White matter microstructural damage in small vessel disease is associated with Montreal cognitive assessment but not with mini mental state examination performances: vascular mild cognitive impairment Tuscany study.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has been proposed as a screening tool in vascular cognitive impairment. Diffusion tensor imaging is sensitive to white matter microstructural damage. We investigated if diffusion tensor imaging-derived indices are more strongly associated with performances on MoCA or on the widely used mini mental state examination in patients with mild cognitive impairment and small vessel disease.METHODS: Mild cognitive impairment patients with moderate/severe degrees of white matter hyperintensities on MRI were enrolled. Lacunar infarcts, cortical atrophy, medial temporal lobe atrophy and median values of mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy of the cerebral white matter were studied and correlated with cognitive tests performances.RESULTS: Seventy-six patients (mean age 75.1±6.8 years, mean years of education 8.0±4.3) were assessed. In univariate analyses, a significant association of both MoCA and mini mental state examination scores with age, education, cortical atrophy, and medial temporal lobe atrophy was found, whereas mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy were associated with MoCA. In partial correlation analyses, adjusting for all demographic and neuroimaging variables, both mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy were associated only with MoCA (mean diffusivity: r= -0.275, P=0.023; fractional anisotropy: r=0.246, P=0.043).CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mild cognitive impairment and small vessel disease, diffusion tensor imaging-measured white matter microstructural damage is more related to MoCA than mini mental state examination performances. MoCA is suited for the cognitive screening of patients with small vessel disease."
"25377475","A meta-analysis of association between cerebral microbleeds and cognitive impairment.","BACKGROUND: The clinical effect of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) on cognition has been receiving much research attention, but results are often inconsistent.METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and some Chinese electronic databases. A total of 15 studies were included.RESULTS: Patients with CMBs had higher incidence of cognitive dysfunction (OR 3.14; 95% CI 1.66-5.92) and lower scores of cognitive function (SMD was -0.36 [-0.55, -0.18] in the MMSE group and -0.65 [-0.99, -0.32] in the MoCA [Montreal Cognitive Assessment] group). The results also indicated that a higher number of CMB lesions led to more severe cognitive dysfunction (SMD was -2.41 [-5.04, -0.21] in the mild group and -2.75 [-3.50, -2.01] in the severe group). We also found that cognitive performance was significantly impaired when CMBs were located in deep (-0.4 [-0.69, -0.11]), lobar regions (-0.50 [-0.92, -0.09]), basal ganglia (-0.72 [-1.03, -0.41]), and thalamus brain regions (-0.65 [-0.98, -0.32]).CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis showed that CMBs were associated with cognitive dysfunction according to higher number and different locations of CMBs. Future work should focus on long-term prognosis of continuing cognitive decline and specific treatments to reduce the formation of CMBs."
"25370761","[Effects of carotid endarterectomy on cognitive function in patients with carotid stenosis].","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the theraputic effects of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) on cognitive function in patients with carotid stenosis (CAS) and congnitive impairment.METHODS: CEA was performed on 38 patients with CAS from December 2011 to July 2013. There were 26 male and 12 female patients, with an average age of (70 ± 7) years. Patients was underwent neuropsychological examinations (NPEs) including Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at 1 week before and 6 weeks after treatment. Cerebral perfusion was assessed with MR perfusion-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted inmaging at 1 week before and 6 weeks after treatment.RESULTS: All of the 38 patients completed NPEs and MRI at baseline and 6 weeks after CEA. After therapy, the parameters and the extents of abnormal perfusion was improved, including the decrease of time to peak (29 ± 9 vs. 23 ± 4), relative mean transit time (22 ± 8 vs. 14 ± 6), arrive time (21 ± 8 vs. 15 ± 4) and relative cerebral blood volume (11.6 ± 3.5 vs. 7.5 ± 3.2) (t = 1.31 to 5.24, all P &lt; 0.05). Significant improvement in MoCA (20.4 ± 1.5 vs. 22.0 ± 1.6, t = -4.25, P = 0.000) but MMSE (26.16 ± 1.35 vs. 26.47 ± 1.52, t = -0.96, P = 0.341) was observed. CEA significantly improved the assessment of visuospacial/constructive abilities (2.4 ± 0.9 vs. 2.8 ± 0.7), naming (2.0 ± 0.7 vs. 2.3 ± 0.6), abstraction (1.2 ± 0.7 vs. 1.6 ± 0.6) and attention (2.3 ± 0.6 vs. 2.6 ± 0.5) (t = 0.015 to 0.029, P = 0.015).CONCLUSION: CEA can improve the cognitive function of patients with carotid stenosis as well as the cerebral perfusion of patients and has therapeutic effects on vascular mild cognitive impairment."
"25354769","Mechanochemical endovenous ablation versus radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of primary small saphenous vein insufficiency (MESSI trial): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive endothermal techniques, for example, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), have revolutionized the treatment of insufficient truncal veins and are associated with an excellent outcome. The use of thermal energy requires the instillation of tumescent anesthesia around the vein. Mechanochemical endovenous ablation (MOCA) combines mechanical endothelial damage, using a rotating wire, with simultaneous infusion of a liquid sclerosans. Tumescent anesthesia is not required as no heat is used. Prospective studies using MOCA in both great and small saphenous veins showed good anatomical and clinical results with fast postoperative recovery.DESIGN: The MESSI trial (Mechanochemical Endovenous ablation versus radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of primary Small Saphenous vein Insufficiency) is a multicenter randomized controlled trial in which a total of 160 patients will be randomized (1:1) to MOCA or RFA. Consecutive patients with primary small saphenous vein incompetence, who meet the eligibility criteria, will be invited to participate in this trial. The primary endpoint is anatomic success, defined as occlusion of the treated veins objectified with duplex ultrasonography at 1 year follow-up. Secondary endpoints are post-procedural pain, initial technical success, clinical success, complications and the duration of the procedure. Initial technical success is defined as the ability to position the device adequately, treat the veins as planned and occlude the treated vein directly after the procedure has been proven by duplex ultrasonography. Clinical success is defined as an objective improvement of clinical outcome after treatment, measured with the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS). Power analyses are conducted for anatomical success and post-procedural pain.Both groups will be evaluated on an intention-to-treat principle.DISCUSSION: The hypothesis of the MESSI trial is that the anatomic success rate of MOCA is not inferior to RFA. The second hypothesis is that post-procedural pain is significantly less after MOCA compared to RFA.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NTR4613 Date of trial registration: 28 May 2014."
"25294066","[Effect of type 2 diabetes with hypertension on cognitive function-a study on elderly living in the communities of Beijing].","OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with hypertension on cognitive function in those community-based elderly who were aged 60 and over, in Beijing.METHODS: 82 patients with T2DM, 142 patients with both T2DM and hypertension and 277 normal controls were investigated in this study. Both methods as: the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE)were used to determine cognitive change.RESULTS: The total MMSE scores showed significant decrease between T2DM with hypertension and controls [(28.42 ± 1.52) vs. (28.88 ± 1.47), P &lt; 0.05]. The MoCA score of the total scores [(25.20 ± 3.91) vs. (26.50 ± 3.29), P &lt; 0.05], sub-scores of visuospatial, executive [(3.60 ± 1.56) vs. (3.96 ± 1.18), P &lt; 0.05] and language [(2.10 ± 0.80) vs. (2.37 ± 0.80), P &lt; 0.05] significantly decreased in T2DM patients with hypertension and in the normal controls. Data from the Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that older age and less education were risk factors for cognitive impairment.CONCLUSION: T2DM and hypertension damaged the cognitive function of patients."
"25272033","Spontaneous brain activity in type 2 diabetics revealed by amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations and its association with diabetic vascular disease: a resting-state FMRI study.","PURPOSE: To investigate correlations between altered spontaneous brain activity, diabetic vascular disease, and cognitive function for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI).METHODS: Rs-fMRI was performed for T2DM patients (n = 26) and age-, gender-, and education-matched non-diabetic control subjects (n = 26). Amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) were computed from fMRI signals to measure spontaneous neuronal activity. Differences in the ALFF patterns between patients and controls, as well as their correlations with clinical variables, were evaluated.RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, T2DM patients exhibited significantly decreased ALFF values mainly in the frontal and parietal lobes, the bilateral thalumi, the posterior lobe of the cerebellum, and increased ALFF values mainly in the visual cortices. Furthermore, lower ALFF values in the left subcallosal gyrus correlated with lower ankle-brachial index values (r = 0.481, p = 0.020), while lower ALFF values in the bilateral medial prefrontal gyri correlated with higher urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (r =<U+200A> -0.418, p = 0.047). In addition, most of the regions with increased ALFF values in the visual cortices were found to negatively correlate with MoCA scores.CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that ALFF are altered in many brain regions in T2DM patients, and this is associated with the presence of diabetic vascular disease and poor cognitive performance. These findings may provide additional insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms that mediate T2DM-related cognitive dysfunction, and may also serve as a reference for future research."
"25248911","Validation of the Montreal cognitive assessment versus mini-mental state examination against hypertension and hypertensive arteriopathy after transient ischemic attack or minor stroke.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Lack of reduced cognitive impairment with blood pressure (BP) lowering in trials may reflect use of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), which is insensitive to mild cognitive impairment after cerebrovascular events compared with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. We determined relationships between impairment on MMSE versus Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) with the major physiological determinant of vascular cognitive impairment: hypertension and hypertensive arteriopathy.METHODS: Cognitive impairment in consecutive patients 6 months after transient ischemic attack or minor stroke was defined as significant, mild, or none (MMSE&lt;23, 23-26, =27; MoCA&lt;20, 20-24, =25) and related to 20 premorbid systolic BP readings, home BP measurement (3 measurements, 3×daily for 1 month), and hypertensive arteriopathy (creatinine, stroke versus transient ischemic attack, leukoaraiosis) by ordinal regression.RESULTS: Of 463 patients, 45% versus 28% had at least mild cognitive impairment on the MoCA versus MMSE (P&lt;0.001). Hypertensive arteriopathy was more strongly associated with cognitive impairment on the MoCA than MMSE (creatinine: odds ratio=3.99; 95% confidence interval, 2.06-7.73 versus 2.16, 1.08-4.33; event: 1.53, 1.06-2.19 versus 1.23, 0.81-1.85; leukoaraiosis: 2.09, 1.42-3.06 versus 1.34, 0.87-2.07). Premorbid and home BP measurement systolic BP were more strongly associated with impairment on vascular subdomains of the MoCA than MMSE (odds ratio/10 mm Hg: visuospatial 1.29 versus 1.05; attention 1.18 versus 1.07; language 1.22 versus 0.91; naming 1.07 versus 0.86).CONCLUSIONS: The stronger relationship between impairment on the MoCA with hypertensive arteriopathy, independent of age, indicates a greater sensitivity for vascular-origin cognitive impairment. Use of MoCA should improve sensitivity for cognitive impairment and treatment effects in future studies."
"25190446","Test accuracy of cognitive screening tests for diagnosis of dementia and multidomain cognitive impairment in stroke.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Guidelines recommend screening stroke-survivors for cognitive impairments. We sought to collate published data on test accuracy of cognitive screening tools.METHODS: Index test was any direct, cognitive screening assessment compared against reference standard diagnosis of (undifferentiated) multidomain cognitive impairment/dementia. We used a sensitive search statement to search multiple, cross-disciplinary databases from inception to January 2014. Titles, abstracts, and articles were screened by independent researchers. We described risk of bias using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool and reporting quality using Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy guidance. Where data allowed, we pooled test accuracy using bivariate methods.RESULTS: From 19 182 titles, we reviewed 241 articles, 35 suitable for inclusion. There was substantial heterogeneity: 25 differing screening tests; differing stroke settings (acute stroke, n=11 articles), and reference standards used (neuropsychological battery, n=21 articles). One article was graded low risk of bias; common issues were case-control methodology (n=7 articles) and missing data (n=22). We pooled data for 4 tests at various screen positive thresholds: Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (&lt;88/100): sensitivity 0.96, specificity 0.70 (2 studies); Mini Mental State Examination (&lt;27/30): sensitivity 0.71, specificity 0.85 (12 studies); Montreal Cognitive Assessment (&lt;26/30): sensitivity 0.95, specificity 0.45 (4 studies); MoCA (&lt;22/30): sensitivity 0.84, specificity 0.78 (6 studies); Rotterdam-CAMCOG (&lt;33/49): sensitivity 0.57, specificity 0.92 (2 studies).CONCLUSIONS: Commonly used cognitive screening tools have similar accuracy for detection of dementia/multidomain impairment with no clearly superior test and no evidence that screening tools with longer administration times perform better. MoCA at usual threshold offers short assessment time with high sensitivity but at cost of specificity; adapted cutoffs have improved specificity without sacrificing sensitivity. Our results must be interpreted in the context of modest study numbers: heterogeneity and potential bias."
"25174562","Association of the ASCO classification with the executive function subscores of the Montreal cognitive assessment in patients with postischemic stroke.","BACKGROUND: The ASCO classification can evaluate the etiology and mechanisms of ischemic stroke more comprehensively and systematically than conventional stroke classification systems such as Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST). Simultaneously, risk factors for cognitive impairment such as arterial sclerosis, leukoaraiosis, and atrial fibrillation can also be gathered and graded using the ASCO classification.METHODS: Sixty patients with postischemic stroke underwent cognitive testing, including testing by the Japanese version of the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA-J) and the mini-mental state examination (MMSE). Ischemic strokes were categorized and graded by the ASCO classification. In this phenotype-based classification, every patient is characterized by the A-S-C-O system (A for Atherosclerosis, S for Small vessel disease, C for Cardiac source, and O for Other cause). Each of the 4 phenotypes is graded 0, 1, 2, or 3, according to severity. The conventional TOAST classification was also applied. Correlations between individual MoCA-J/MMSE scores and the ASCO scores were assessed.RESULTS: The total score of the ASCO classification significantly correlated with the total scores of MoCA-J and MMSE. This correlation was more apparent in MoCA-J than in MMSE, because MoCA-J scores were normally distributed, whereas MMSE scores were skewed toward the higher end of the range (ceiling effect). Results for individual subtests of MoCA-J and MMSE indicated that cognitive function for visuoexecutive, calculation, abstraction, and remote recall significantly correlated with ASCO score.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the ASCO phenotypic classification of stroke is useful not only for assessing the etiology of ischemic stroke but also for predicting cognitive decline after ischemic stroke."
"25159539","Glucose metabolism measured by positron emission tomography is reduced in patients with white matter presumably ischemic lesions.","BACKGROUND: The severity and progression of white matter ischemic lesion (WMIL) are closely linked to vascular dementia. The function of neural tissue is closely linked to glucose consumption as the most important energy-supplying metabolic process. At present, [18]fluorine-fluorodeoxy glucose ([18]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) can provide regional and 3-dimensional quantification of glucose metabolism in the human brain. Although MMSE and MoCA are commonly used screens in cognitive impairment, no research team has yet validated their performance in WMIL. The purpose of our study was to compare MMSE and MoCA in screening for cognitive impairment and to explore the correlations between CMRglu values and executive function.MATERIAL AND METHODS: All the participants underwent comprehensive clinical, MoCA, MMSE, MRI, and PET examinations. Patients in the WMIL group were subdivided into 3 severity subgroups according to the Fazekas scale.RESULTS: The MoCA scores were lower in the WMIL group. Our research indicates that MoCA is a more sensitive screening tool than the commonly used MMSE in detecting cognitive impairment in patients with WMIL. CMRglu values of gray matter were decreased in the WMIL group. Reductions of CMRglu in parietal lobe, frontal lobe, and white matter centrum semiovale were observed to different degrees in the WMIL groups according to the modified Fazekas scale. A significant negative correlation was found between executive function and CMRglu in the frontal lobe.CONCLUSIONS: MoCA appears to be a more sensitive screening tool than the commonly used MMSE in detecting cognitive impairment in patients with WMIL. CMRglu can potentially be used as a biomarker for predicting the severity of WMIL."
"25129549","Influence of carotid artery stenting on cognition of elderly patients with severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery.","BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of carotid artery stenting (CAS) on the cognition and quality of life of elderly patients with severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery.METHODS: 65 elderly patients with symptomatic severe stenosis of internal carotid artery were recruited into 2 groups: the pharmacotherapy group (n=29) and the CAS group (n=36). Before surgery and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery, Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) was used for the evaluation of cognition and WHOQOL-BREF was used for the assessment of quality of life.RESULTS: At 12 months after surgery, total MoCA score and WHOQOL-BREF score in the pharmacotherapy group was significantly reduced when compared with those before surgery (P&lt;0.05). In the CAS group, the total MoCA score, scores of attention and delayed recall, and WHOQOL-BREF score increased significantly at different time points after surgery when compared with those before surgery (P&lt;0.05). Moreover, in CAS group, the MoCA score and WHOQOL-BREF markedly increased gradually over time (P&lt;0.05). Compared with the pharmacotherapy group, cognition and quality of life in the CAS group were improved dramatically during the follow-up period (P&lt;0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery is a cause of cognition impairment, and CAS may improve cognition and quality of life."
"25114516","Relationship between cognitive impairment and apparent diffusion coefficient values from magnetic resonance-diffusion weighted imaging in elderly hypertensive patients.","BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine a new method for the early diagnosis and assessment of mild cognitive impairment in elderly individuals with hypertension. Elderly hypertensive patients with cognitive impairment were assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Clinical Dementia Rating Assessment (CDR). Cognitive results were compared to apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values from magnetic resonance-diffusion weighted imaging.METHODS: A total of 191 patients were categorized into four groups: a control group (normal cognition and no hypertension; n=20); a normal group (hypertension and normal cognition; n=33); an mild cognitive impairment group (n=80); and a vascular dementia group (n=58). The MoCA and CDR tests were used to determine cognition. ADC values in eight brain regions were calculated with magnetic resonance-diffusion weighted imaging. Other characteristics were evaluated, eg, blood pressure, MoCA, and CDR scores, and the comparisons of the four groups were made.RESULTS: The MoCA and CDR scores differed among the four groups (P&lt;0.001). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure values increased as cognitive function declined (P&lt;0.001). Cognitive function declined as ADC values increased, and they differed between elderly people with and without hypertension (P&lt;0.001). Among elderly hypertensive participants, ADC values were significantly increased in the cortex and hippocampus.CONCLUSION: The MoCA and CDR tests were sufficiently sensitive to evaluate cognition. Blood pressure was closely related to cognition, as well as to functional and structural changes in the brain. These alterations were evidenced through changes in the ADC values and were most obvious in the cortex and hippocampus. Greater cognitive decline was observed in elderly participants with hypertension compared to those without. As hypertensive stage increased, greater ADC values were observed."
"25099775","The synergistic effect of acupuncture and computer-based cognitive training on post-stroke cognitive dysfunction: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial of 2 × 2 factorial design.","BACKGROUND: Stroke is one of the most common causes of cognitive impairment. Up to 75% of stroke survivors may be considered to have cognitive impairment, which severely limit individual autonomy for successful reintegration into family, work and social life. The clinical efficacy of acupuncture with Baihui (DU20) and Shenting (DU24) in stroke and post-stroke cognitive impairment has been previously demonstrated. Computer-assisted cognitive training is part of conventional cognitive rehabilitation and has also shown to be effective in improvement of cognitive function of affected patients. However, the cognitive impairment after stroke is so complexity that one single treatment cannot resolve effectively. Besides, the effects of acupuncture and RehaCom cognitive training have not been systematically compared, nor has the possibility of a synergistic effect of combination of the two therapeutic modalities been evaluated. Our primary aim of this trial is to evaluate the synergistic effect of acupuncture and RehaCom cognitive training on cognitive dysfunction after stroke.DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial of 2 × 2 factorial design will be conducted in the Rehabilitation Hospital Affiliated to Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. A total of 240 patients with cognitive dysfunction after stroke who meet the eligibility criteria will be recruited and randomized into RehaCom training group, acupuncture group, a combination of both or control group in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. All patients will receive conventional treatment. The interventions will last for 12 weeks (30 min per day, Monday to Friday every week). Evaluations will be conducted by blinded assessors at baseline and again at 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Outcome measurements include mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Montreal cognitive assessments (MoCA), functional independence measure scale (FIM) and adverse events.DISCUSSION: The results of this trial are expected to clarify the synergistic effect of acupuncture and RehaCom cognitive training on cognitive dysfunction after stroke. Furthermore, to confirm whether combined or alone of acupuncture and RehaCom cognitive training, is more effective than conventional treatment in the management of post-stroke cognitive dysfunction.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR-TRC-13003704."
"25090922","Patterns in default-mode network connectivity for determining outcomes in cognitive function in acute stroke patients.","OBJECT: To investigate whether resting-state functional connectivity (FC) differed in the default mode network (DMN) in stroke patients with and without post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI vs. Non-PSCI) and to explore the relationship between DMN connectivity and the cognitive performance in stroke patients.METHODS: We totally enrolled twenty healthy controls and 18 stroke patients. The stroke patients were divided into two subgroups on the basis of the cognitive assays. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were recorded 10 days and 3 months after the stroke. Independent component analysis was used to isolate the DMN. One-way analysis of variance was performed to detect different FC among groups. Pearson correlation analyses were conducted to determine the relationships between FC strength and the MoCA and MMSE scores.RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, both Non-PSCI patients and PSCI patients showed significantly decreased FC in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCu), as well as increased FC in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and left hippocampus. However, Non-PSCI patients showed more significantly increased FC in the MPFC and hippocampus than PSCI patients did. The FC in the PCC/PCu was related to the MoCA score measured at a 10-day follow-up, and the FC in the left hippocampus predicted the MoCA score measured at 3 months follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may be helpful for facilitating further understanding of the potential mechanism underlying PSCI, and suggests that resting-state DMN connectivity could serve as neuroimaging biomarkers for future interventional studies."
"25063270","Role of cognitive enhancer therapy in Alzheimer's disease with concomitant cerebral white matter disease: findings from a long-term naturalistic study.","BACKGROUND: Evidence is lacking for cognitive enhancer therapy in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and concomitant cerebrovascular disease (mixed AD) as such patients would have been excluded from clinical trials. Earlier studies of mixed AD have focused on large vessel cerebrovascular disease. The influence of small vessel cerebrovascular disease (svCVD) in the form of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) on treatment outcomes in mixed AD has not been addressed.OBJECTIVE: In this long-term naturalistic study, we evaluated the effectiveness of cognitive enhancers in patients with mixed AD with svCVD.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospective clinical database from a memory clinic of a tertiary hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging WMH was used as a marker of svCVD. Demographic, cognitive, and treatment data were analysed. Linear mixed models with patient-specific random effects were used to evaluate cognitive outcomes over time while adjusting for confounders.RESULTS: Patients with mixed AD (n = 137) or AD without svCVD (pure AD) (n = 28) were studied over a median duration of 28.7 months. Patients with mixed AD had a higher prevalence of hypertension (62.8 vs. 35.7 %, p = 0.011). The majority (75.2 %) of the study sample were managed with monotherapy. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores decreased over time (-0.04, p = 0.007), and the decrease was similar for both diagnosis groups (-0.03, p = 0.246). Annual estimated mean MMSE decline was 0.84 for pure AD and 0.48 for mixed AD. Similar trends were observed with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores, with annual estimated mean reduction of 0.72 and 0.48 for pure AD and mixed AD, respectively.CONCLUSION: Cognitive enhancers are effective in slowing the rate of cognitive decline in patients with AD with svCVD. These findings would need to be confirmed in randomized clinical trials."
"25040216","Feasibility of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in acute stroke patients.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cognitive deficits are common following stroke. Cognitive function in the acute stroke setting is a predictive factor for mid-term outcome. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a screening tool for cognitive impairment. The feasibility of MoCA in the acute phase of stroke was evaluated and factors predictive of cognitive impairment were determined.METHODS: In this prospective, single-centre, explorative and observational study consecutive patients with ischaemic (IS) or haemorrhagic (ICH) stroke were enrolled between March 2011 and September 2012. The routine work-up for each patient encompassed assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the pre-morbid modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Cognitive performance was measured using the German version of the MoCA within the first days of admission. A MoCA score of &lt;26 was considered to indicate cognitive impairment.RESULTS: Between March 2011 and September 2012 a total of 842 patients with IS (89.0%) and ICH (11.0%) were enrolled in our study. MoCA was feasible in 678/842 patients (80.5%). Factors independently associated with non-feasibility were stroke severity (NIHSS), pre-morbid functional status (mRS), age and lower educational level. Mean MoCA was 21.4 (SD 5.7). A total of 498/678 (73.5%) patients appeared cognitively impaired (&lt;26/30). Independent predictive factors for a lower MoCA score were age, educational level, stroke severity (NIHSS) and pre-morbid functional status (mRS).CONCLUSIONS: In the acute phase of stroke, MoCA is feasible in about 80% of eligible patients. At this stage, MoCA identifies a cognitive impairment in 75% of patients."
"25017513","The prevalence and impact of undiagnosed cognitive impairment in older vascular surgical patients.","OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this observational cohort study were to investigate the prevalence of undiagnosed cognitive impairment in older patients presenting for vascular surgery, to examine its association with adverse postoperative outcomes, and to test the feasibility of a preoperative cognitive assessment tool.METHODS: Patients aged 60 years or older were recruited by consent on admission to the vascular surgical ward of an inner-city teaching hospital with a large tertiary referral practice for proposed elective or emergency aortic or lower limb arterial intervention. Cognition was assessed preoperatively by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and a score below 24/30 indicated cognitive impairment or dementia. The mean length of time taken to complete the assessment was recorded. Baseline characteristics (medical multimorbidity, frailty, and laboratory tests), hospital length of stay (LOS), and postoperative complications were documented.RESULTS: Preoperative MoCA was completed in 114 patients with a mean age of 76.3 years (standard deviation, 7.36 years); 67.5% were men, and 55.3% of procedures were elective. The MoCA was completed in 100% of patients and was quick and acceptable to patients in this setting. Cognitive impairment or dementia was found in 68% of patients (77 of 114) and was previously unrecognized in 88.3% of patients (68 of 77). Therefore, 60.5% of patients (68 of 114) aged 60 years or older presenting for vascular surgery had previously undiagnosed cognitive impairment. MoCA &lt;24 was univariately associated with pre-existing frailty (Edmonton Frail Scale [EFS] score =6.5) and longer LOS (=12 days). In logistic regression modeling, MoCA &lt;24 was strongly independently associated with frailty EFS score =6.5 (odds ratio, 12.55; P &lt; .001). By use of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), MoCA &lt;24 was predictive of longer LOS of =12 days (AUC, 0.621; P = .049). The strength of predictive power increased with the addition of frailty (EFS score =6.5) to the models (AUC, 0.695; P = .002).CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of cognitive impairment among older patients presenting for vascular surgery is high and frequently undiagnosed before admission. It is feasible to use the MoCA to identify cognitive impairment in this high-risk surgical group preoperatively. The combined assessment of frailty and cognition is predictive of adverse postoperative outcomes and longer LOS."
"24990175","Influence of stent-assisted angioplasty on cognitive function and affective disorder in elderly patients with symptomatic vertebrobasilar artery stenosis.","BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate cognitive function and affective disorder in elderly patients with symptomatic vertebrobasilar artery stenosis (SVAS) after stent-assisted angioplasty (SAA) and to explore the potential mechanism.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study subjects were 26 elderly SVAS patients who were non-responsive to pharmacotherapy and received SAA (study group) and 30 patients receiving intracoronary stent implantation (control group). Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), Hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD), and Hamilton anxiety rating scale (HAMA) were used.RESULTS: The total MoCA score, scores of line connection, copying cube, drawing clock, and delayed recall increased significantly in the study group after surgery (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01). In addition, the MoCA score increased over time and the total MoCA score at 12 months was markedly higher than that at 1 month (P&lt;0.05). The scores of HAMD and HAMA decreased dramatically after surgery compared with before surgery in these patients (P&lt;0.01). A comparison at the corresponding period was performed between study group and control group, and it was found that the differences in total MoCA scores and scores of line connection, copying cube, drawing clock, and delayed recall before surgery and at 1 month after surgery were significant (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01).CONCLUSIONS: SAA may improve the visuospatial/executive abilities and delayed recall, as well as the depression and anxiety in patients with SVAS. Larger and controlled trails are needed to investigate the effect of SAA on cognition and affection in these patients."
"26993387","Mechanochemical endovenous ablation for the treatment of great saphenous vein insufficiency.","OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the feasibility, safety, and 1-year results of mechanochemical endovenous ablation (MOCA) of great saphenous vein (GSV) insufficiency.METHODS: A consecutive 106 patients were treated for primary GSV insufficiency with MOCA by the ClariVein device and polidocanol. The primary outcome measures were technical success, clinical success, and anatomic success after 1 year of follow-up. Secondary outcome measures were postprocedural pain, complications, general- and disease-specific quality of life, and time to return to work. Patients were evaluated with clinical examination and duplex ultrasonography at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year after treatment.RESULTS: The technical success was 99%. The mean postprocedural pain during the first 14 days after treatment was 7.5 mm (interquartile range [IQR], 0.0-10.0 mm) per day on a 0- to 100-mm visual analog scale. The time to return to normal activities and work was 1.0 day (IQR, 0-1.0 day) and 1.0 day (IQR, 1.0-4.0 days), respectively. No major complications were recorded. At 1-year follow-up, the clinical success was 93%. The Venous Clinical Severity Score decreased significantly from 4.0 (IQR, 3.0-5.0) before treatment to 1.0 (IQR, 0-1.0) (P &lt; .001) 1 year after MOCA. At 1 year, 88.2% of the treated GSVs remained occluded as measured by duplex ultrasonography. Twelve patients had a recanalization, of which eight were partial. Disease-specific quality of life and the RAND 36-Item Health Survey scores improved significantly at 1-year follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: MOCA is a safe and effective technique in the treatment of GSV insufficiency with good clinical and anatomic success at 1-year follow-up. The technique is related to low postprocedural pain scores, low complication rate, improved quality of life, and rapid resumption of normal activities and work."
"24953703","Feasibility of the cognitive assessment scale for stroke patients (CASP) vs. MMSE and MoCA in aphasic left hemispheric stroke patients.","INTRODUCTION: Post-stroke aphasia makes it difficult to assess cognitive deficiencies. We thus developed the CASP, which can be administered without using language. Our objective was to compare the feasibility of the CASP, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in aphasic stroke patients.MATERIAL AND METHODS: All aphasic patients consecutively admitted to seven French rehabilitation units during a 4-month period after a recent first left hemispheric stroke were assessed with CASP, MMSE and MoCA. We determined the proportion of patients in whom it was impossible to administer at least one item from these 3 scales, and compared their administration times.RESULTS: Forty-four patients were included (age 64±15, 26 males). The CASP was impossible to administer in eight of them (18%), compared with 16 for the MMSE (36%, P=0.05) and 13 for the MoCA (30%, P=0.21, NS). It was possible to administer the CASP in all of the patients with expressive aphasia, whereas the MMSE and the MoCA could not be administered. Administration times were longer for the CASP (13±4min) than for the MMSE (8±3min, P&lt;10(-6)) and the MoCA (11±5min, P=0.23, NS).CONCLUSION: The CASP is more feasible than the MMSE and the MoCA in aphasic stroke patients."
"24938319","Alterations in the gray matter volume in transient ischemic attack: a voxel-based morphometry study.","BACKGROUND: Several studies have emphasized that transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients suffered functional impairments, but whether underlying morphological alterations exist remains unclear. This study aims to detect possible gray matter volume (GMV) alterations in patients with TIA using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) method.METHODS: High-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images of 21 patients were compared with 21 healthy controls of matching age, gender, and education. Changes in the GMV were observed using VBM technique, followed by two-sample t-test analysis to detect the differences in the GMV between TIA patients and healthy controls. Correlations between the clinical parameters and the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scores, and the altered GMV in TIAs, were investigated.RESULTS: Two-sample t-test analysis revealed a significant GMV reduction in specific regions in the default mode network (DMN) in TIA patients, including the bilateral medial frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and precuneus. No correlation was found between the reduced GMV and MoCA scores and clinical parameters.CONCLUSION: Transient ischemic attack patients showed widespread morphology atrophy in DMN, suggesting that, despite the absence of a cerebral infarction, ischemic injury may induce structural abnormalities and eventually contribute to functional impairments in TIA patients. Our results may provide a valuable basis for the pathophysiological mechanism related to the cognitive dysfunction of TIA from the view of brain morphology."
"24915593","Histological observations one year after mechanochemical endovenous ablation of the great saphenous vein.","PURPOSE: To report histological analysis of a great saphenous vein (GSV) 1 year after undergoing mechanochemical endovenous ablation (MOCA) and compare the findings with those of a healthy vein.CASE REPORT: A 59-year-old patient with bilateral GSV incompetence was treated with MOCA using the ClariVein catheter, which has a dispersion wire that rotates as liquid sclerosant is injected in the vein. After 1 year, the patient had recurrent edema of the right leg; duplex ultrasound was suspicious for recanalization. The patient was reoperated, and the deep femoral vein was explored. The GSV was completely obliterated, and its proximal part was excised and sent for histological processing. Microscopic evaluation of the MOCA-treated vein showed a circumferential disappearance of the endothelial layer and fibrosis of the vein. The media was considerably damaged, with changes in collagen structure, supporting the therapeutic effect of MOCA.CONCLUSION: MOCA is a novel endovenous treatment modality for saphenous vein insufficiency. Results of MOCA on the cellular level are essential to optimize treatment."
"24913931","Cognitive function, depression, anxiety and quality of life in Chinese patients with untreated unruptured intracranial aneurysms.","Detected unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA) are becoming more common with the increased utilization of CT angiography, MR angiography and digital subtraction angiography. A proportion of patients with UIA remain untreated. We investigated to assess cognitive function, depression, anxiety and quality of life (QoL) in Chinese patients with untreated UIA. Thirty one Chinese patients with untreated UIA and 25 healthy controls were identified and matched for variables including age, sex, and living area. Cognitive function was evaluated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Depression, anxiety and QoL were screened with the Self-Rating Depression Scale, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, and Short Form-36, respectively. Non-parametric tests were used for comparisons between groups. No patient had cognitive dysfunction at 1 month or 1 year after detection of UIA. However, a significant decrease of overall MoCA subscores was found in 30 (97%) of 31 patients 5 years after UIA discovery, suggestive of mild cognitive impairment. A significant decrease in depression and anxiety was found in patients over time. QoL in patients was reduced most prominently in psychosocial function and social activities 1 year after detection of UIA, but these improved to within normal limits at the end of the follow-up period. For Chinese patients with untreated UIA, depression, anxiety and reduced QoL may be short-term complications. Mild cognitive impairment may be a long-term complication."
"24903316","Feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of early mood screening to diagnose persisting clinical depression/anxiety disorder after stroke.","BACKGROUND: Depression/anxiety disorders are common after stroke and have a negative impact on outcomes. Guidelines recommend that all stroke survivors are screened for these problems. However, there is no consensus on timing or method of assessment. We investigated the feasibility and accuracy of a very early screening strategy and the diagnostic accuracy this has for depression/anxiety disorders at 1 month.METHODS: Screening tools were Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Depression Intensity Scale Circles (DISCs); we also assessed cognition using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Screening was offered to sequential stroke admissions. At 1 month we assessed for clinical depression/anxiety disorder using Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and retested screening tools. We described test accuracy of acute depression/anxiety screening for clinical diagnosis of depression/anxiety disorder at 1 month and described temporal change in screening test scores. We assessed feasibility by describing proportions that were able, agreed to and completed the screening tests.RESULTS: Over 4 months, 102/146 admissions were suitable for screening following initial medical assessment, 69 (68%) agreed to screening, of whom 33 (48%) required researcher assistance to complete the screening test battery. Median time to assessment was 2 days (IQR: 1-4). Early HADS suggested n = 9 (13%) with depression; DISCs n = 25 (37%). Median acute MoCA was 21/30. At 1 month, n = 61 (88%) provided data. Repeat scores showed improvement over time; HADS (anxiety) mean difference: 2.5 (95% CI: 1.2-3.7), HADS (depression) mean difference: 1.6 (95% CI: 0.3-2.9). MINI defined n = 12 (20%) with depression and n = 6 (10%) with anxiety disorder. Comparing baseline screening to 1-month clinical diagnosis, HADS sensitivity was 0.25 (95% CI: 0.09-0.53) and specificity 0.94 (95% CI: 0.84-0.98); DISCs sensitivity was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.65-0.99) and specificity 0.78 (95% CI: 0.64-0.87).CONCLUSIONS: Even amongst 'medically stable' stroke patients, depression/anxiety screening at the acute stage may not be feasible or accurate. Half of participants required assistance from the researcher to complete assessments. The poor predictive accuracy of HADS for depression/anxiety disorder at 1 month may be due in part to the high prevalence of cognitive impairment in our sample. Screening in the first few days after stroke does not appear useful for detecting clinically important and sustained depression/anxiety problems."
"24901953","A new method for evaluation of motor injury after acute brain ischemic damage.","PURPOSE: Motor impairment is an important index for assessing the extent of brain injury. The present study uses a new method, the movement capture analysis (MOCA) system, for assessing motor damage after acute ischemia.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty rats were divided into four groups: standard ischemia, sham-operated, Dizocilpine (MK-801), and Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) groups. Brain ischemia was induced using the temporary right middle cerebral artery occlusion model. Longa score and MOCA were used to assess motor injury one day after ischemia. Infarct volume was delineated with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. The correlation of infarct volume with Longa score and MOCA data was calculated.RESULTS: Compared with the sham-operated group (0.10 ± 0.31), Longa scores of MK-801 (2.33 ± 0.73), GBE (1.80 ± 0.58), and standard (2.88 ± 0.83) groups showed a statistical difference (p &lt; 0.05); however, it was unable to discern the difference between MK-801 and standard groups. MOCA was able to clearly discern the differences in motor disparity among the four groups, standard (1.00 ± 0.19), sham-operated group (0.17 ± 0.02), MK-801 (0.79 ± 0.08), GBE (0.38 ± 0.05) (p &lt; 0.05). Both MK-801 (18.03 ± 0.96%) and GBE (10.82 ± 1.93%) treatment reduced infarct size compared with the standard ischemia group (25.88 ± 1.16%) (p &lt; 0.05). The MOCA data showed a more significant correlation with infarct size than Longa score (r = 0.85:0.53).CONCLUSIONS: MOCA system proved to be more sensitive than the Longa score. It may potentially be more accurate method for behavioral evaluation in clinical trials."
"24880539","Underestimation of cognitive impairments by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in an acute stroke unit population.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is an increasingly popular clinical screening tool for detecting cognitive impairment in stroke, but few studies have directly compared performance on the MoCA with neuropsychological assessment. Our retrospective study examined the extent to which intact performance on the MoCA reflects intact cognition as determined by neuropsychological assessment.METHODS: In this retrospective study, cognitive profiles for 136 acute stroke patients admitted to the Acute Stroke Unit who had available MoCA and neuropsychological assessment data were examined.RESULTS: 22% of our patients were deemed cognitively intact on the MoCA. Of these, 78% were found to be impaired (= 5%ile) on neuropsychological assessment in one or more cognitive domains. The most common impairments were in general intelligence, information processing speed and visual memory; three areas not assessed by the MoCA. In addition, a high proportion (up to 59%) of patients who scored the maximum points in one of the MoCA-specified domains were impaired on comparable neuropsychological assessment.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that although the MoCA may be a useful screening tool post-stroke in detecting gross impairments, neuropsychological assessment is still necessary for a comprehensive and reliable detection of domain-specific cognitive deficits, which can more reliably inform us for realistic goal setting and vocational advice vital for effective rehabilitation."
"24831647","Incidence, characteristics and functional implications of cerebral embolic lesions after the MitraClip procedure.","AIMS: This study aimed to assess the incidence and impact of cerebral embolic events after the MitraClip procedure.METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-seven high-risk patients (logistic EuroSCORE I 25±15%) underwent the MitraClip procedure and cerebral diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in median two days before and three days after the procedure. On the same day, neurocognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) questionnaire and thorough clinical examination. Comparison of pre- and post-interventional MRI showed that 23 of 27 patients (85.7%) had newly acquired microembolic lesions with in median three (interquartile range 1-9) new lesions per patient. Of these, three patients (11.1%) had lesions with diameter &gt;5 mm. Patients with &gt;3 new cerebral embolic lesions (n=13, 48%) had a lower post-interventional MoCA score in comparison to patients with =3 embolic lesions (23.6±3.6 vs. 20.3±4.5; p=0.046) in univariate analysis. Multivariate stepwise regression analysis identified device time as an independent predictor of the number of post-procedural new lesions (p=0.003) and, for reduced post-interventional MoCA score, a low MoCA score at baseline (p&lt;0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The MitraClip procedure results in new ischaemic cerebral lesions in the vast majority of patients. Preliminary data suggest that these lesions are clinically without significant impact on global cognitive function. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01288976."
"24757105","Serial montreal cognitive assessments demonstrate reversible cognitive impairment in patients with acute transient ischemic attack and minor stroke.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cognitive changes after ischemic stroke are often overlooked, particularly acutely and in patients with mild or transient deficits. We assessed patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA)/minor stroke with serial cognitive screening tests. We tested the hypothesis that mild acute deficits are transient and improve after TIA/minor stroke.METHODS: Patients with acute TIA/minor ischemic stroke, without a history of cognitive impairment, presenting with a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score =3 were assessed &lt;72 hours of onset. Patients were administered the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at days 1, 7, 30, and 90. Cognitive impairment was defined as MoCA &lt;26 and MMSE =26.RESULTS: One hundred patients with a median (interquartile range) National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score of 1 (2) and median age of 68 (20) years were included. Baseline median MoCA score (26 [4]) was lower than the MMSE (29 [2]; P&lt;0.0001). Cognitive impairment was detected in 54 of 100 patients (54%) with MoCA and 16 of 100 (16%; P=0.001) with MMSE. MoCA scores improved at day 7 (27 [5]), day 30 (28 [2]), and day 90 (28 [2]; P&lt;0.0001). Resolution of cognitive deficits was because of resolution of recall deficits.CONCLUSIONS: Acute temporary cognitive impairment after TIA/minor stroke is common. The MoCA is sensitive to these changes, but the MMSE is not. Routine cognitive assessment after TIA/minor stroke may be warranted and relevant to return to activities even when other neurological deficits are not evident."
"24746932","Comparisons of cognitive function and serum S-100B level between diabetic and non-diabetic patients after the implantation of carotid artery stent (CAS).","To investigate cognitive function improvement in diabetic and non-diabetic patients after the implantation of Carotid Artery Stent (CAS), 128 patients suffering severe carotid stenosis were successfully enrolled in this study. Tests including, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), Clock Drawing Test (CDT), Hasegawa's Dementia Scale-Revised (HDS-R) and the serum levels of S-100B, were all measured at baseline for 3 months after the implantation of CAS. The baseline characteristics were similar between the patients with and without diabetes. 3 months after the implantation, significant improvements in MMSE (24.8 ± 2.2 vs. 25.2 ± 2.1, p=0.003), MoCA (25.6 ± 2.0 vs. 26.1 ± 1.9, p=0.000), ADAS-Cog (6.5 ± 1.3 vs. 6.1 ± 1.3, p=0.000), and CDT (3.3 ± 0.7 vs. 3.5 ± 0.7, p=0.034) were observed in the non-diabetic group. In contrast, there was no significant improvement in any of the cognitive test for the diabetic group. Another interesting discovery was the CAS procedure significantly decreased the S-100B level in the non-diabetic group (0.11 ± 0.04 ng/mL vs. 0.10 ± 0.04 ng/mL, p=0.000), but similar phenomena were not discovered in the diabetic group. In this light, the change of the S-100B level was negatively correlated with the results in the MMSE (p&lt;0.01) and the MoCA (p&lt;0.01) tests, and positively correlated with the result in ADAS-Cog (p&lt;0.05) test. Our findings suggest that the CAS-induced beneficial effects on cognitive function might have a correlation relationship with the serum level of S-100B."
"24726004","Mechanochemical endovenous Ablation versus RADiOfrequeNcy Ablation in the treatment of primary great saphenous vein incompetence (MARADONA): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is associated with an excellent outcome in the treatment of great saphenous vein (GSV) incompetence. The use of thermal energy as a treatment source requires the instillation of tumescence anesthesia. Mechanochemical endovenous ablation (MOCA) combines mechanical endothelial damage, using a rotating wire, with the infusion of a liquid sclerosant. Tumescence anesthesia is not required. Preliminary experiences with MOCA showed good results and low post-procedural pain.DESIGN: The MARADONA (Mechanochemical endovenous Ablation versus RADiOfrequeNcy Ablation) trial is a multicenter randomized controlled trial in which 460 patients will be randomly allocated to MOCA or RFA. All patients with primary GSV incompetence who meet the eligibility criteria will be invited to participate in this trial. The primary endpoints are anatomic and clinical success at a one-year follow-up, and post-procedural pain. The secondary endpoints are technical success, complications, operation time, procedural pain, disease-specific quality of life, time taken to return to daily activities and/or work, and cost-efficiency analyses after RFA or MOCA. Both groups will be evaluated on an intention to treat base.DISCUSSION: The MARADONA trial is designed to show equal results in anatomic and clinical success after one year, comparing MOCA with RFA. In our hypothesis MOCA has an equal anatomic and clinical success compared with RFA, with less post-procedural pain.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials NCT01936168."
"24674952","Cog-4 has limited diagnostic test accuracy and validity for cognitive assessment in stroke survivors.","BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend cognitive screening for all stroke survivors but do not suggest a preferred tool. Certain elements (orientation, executive function, language, and inattention) of the impairment scale, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), have been suggested as a short cognitive screening test-Cog-4. We aimed to describe accuracy and validity of Cog-4 against a more detailed cognitive assessment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]).METHODS: We assessed consecutive acute stroke unit admissions in 2 hospitals over 3 months. Four independent blinded assessors performed NIHSS and MoCA between days 1 and 4 poststroke. We described test properties of Cog-4 for MoCA-defined cognitive impairment using usual thresholds (Cog-4=1 and MoCA&lt;26 of 30) and described the correlations of individual Cog-4 components with broadly equivalent MoCA domains.RESULTS: We assessed 173 participants; 166 had Cog-4 data and 148 MoCA. MoCA described 84% (n=124) of assessed participants as having cognitive impairment and the Cog-4, 37% (n=62). Cog-4 had a sensitivity of .36 (95% confidence interval [CI]: .28-.45) and a specificity of .96 (95% CI: .80-.99) (positive predictive value: .98, negative predictive value: .23) for MoCA-defined cognitive impairment. Individual Cog-4 items correlated with certain MoCA domains, but the strength of association was modest (r=-.44 orientation, -.37 language, -.19 for inattention, and no significant correlation for executive function, P=.72).CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that many stroke survivors with MoCA-defined cognitive problems would not be detected by Cog-4. Subtest correlations suggest that Cog-4 may not be a valid measure of the cognitive domains that it purports to describe. Other brief cognitive screening tests may be better suited to acute stroke."
"24643000","Neurocognitive improvement after carotid artery stenting in patients with chronic internal carotid artery occlusion: a prospective, controlled, single-center study.","Symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion with hemodynamic impairment remains a dismal disease when untreated. In this prospective, single-center, controlled study, we investigated the feasibility, safety, and long-term outcome of stenting by endovascular recanalization for patients with chronic ICA occlusion. Forty patients with symptomatic chronically occluded ICA were assigned to receive endovascular recanalization (group A, n = 18) or conservative management (group B, n = 22). The primary end point was 100% complete recanalization of the primary occlusion at 60 minutes, and secondary end points were improvement in neurologic function and cognitive function. Patients in the 2 groups were comparable in demographic and baseline characteristics. Successful recanalization was achieved in 88.9% (16 of 18) of patients with the restoration of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Ischemia/Thrombolysis in Cerebral Ischemia 2 or 3 flow. There was no procedural or new cerebral ischemic event. Improvement in brain perfusion was observed in 12 (12 of 18, 75%) patients on single-photon emission computed tomography. Improvement in neurologic function defined as a reduction of =4 points on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at 6 months was observed in group A (baseline, 6.83 ± 3.01 vs 6 months, 2.61 ± 1.20; P &lt; .01) and group B (baseline, 6.05 ± 2.75 vs 6 months, 4.77 ± 1.69; P &lt; .05). A significant difference in NIHSS scores was noted between group A and B at 1, 3, and 6 months (P &lt; .05 or .001). Improvement in cognitive function defined as an increase of =8 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was observed in group A at 3 and 6 months (baseline, 14.67 ± 3.56 vs 3 months, 24.17 ± 3.55 and 6 months, 24.72 ± 2.85; P &lt; .01). Significant improvement in MoCA was also observed in group B (P &lt; .01). Furthermore, a significant difference in MoCA scores was noted between group A and B at 1, 3, and 6 months (P &lt; .05 or .001). Endovascular recanalization is feasible and safe for patients with symptomatic chronic carotid artery occlusion. Successful carotid artery stenting can improve neurological function and global cognitive function than nonrevascularization. "
"24641691","Impact of regional white matter lesions on cognitive function in subcortical vascular cognitive impairment.","OBJECTIVES: Exact characterization and localization of white matter lesions (WMLs) as they relate and contribute to vascular cognitive impairment is highly debated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of WML on cognitive function by using a new anatomy-based classification method.METHODS: We detected WML accurately by using a three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (3D FLAIR) imaging technique and subsequently segmented WMLs by using an anatomy-based method. Participants included 56 consecutive patients diagnosed with subcortical vascular cognitive impairment (SubVCI). The volume of WMLs in different anatomic regions was measured. The volume of the hippocampus, the corpus callosum (CC), any lacunar infarcts, total gray matter (GM), and total brain volumes were also calculated.RESULTS: Hippocampal (P <U+200A>=<U+200A> 0.005) as well as temporal WML volumes (P <U+200A>=<U+200A> 0.039) were both independently associated with mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score. Only the parietal WML volume (P <U+200A>=<U+200A> 0.000) was independently associated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score. Frontal WMLs were independently correlated with executive function. Occipital WMLs were independently associated with visuospatial and recall function. Language impairment was independently correlated with both parietal GM and parietal WML volume. Functions related to orientation were independently associated with parietal WML volume.DISCUSSION: The volume of WMLs in the temporal region as well as in the hippocampus were both independently associated with MMSE score. For the MoCA score, however, only parietal WML volumes were independently correlated. White matter lesions within different anatomic regions were separately correlated with different subdomains of cognitive function."
"24578460","The Lawton Instrumental Activities Daily Living/Activities Daily Living Scales: A Sensitive Test to Alzheimer Disease in Community-Dwelling Elderly People?","OBJECTIVE: To examine the diagnostic ability of the Lawton Instrumental Activities Daily Living (IADLs) scale and the Activities Daily Living (ADLs) scale as a sensitive tool to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in community-dwelling elderly people.DESIGN: In an old age memory outpatient center, among patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD dementia or no dementia supported by at least 6 months of follow-up, we looked back at the baseline Lawton IADL scale (short version IADL-4 item), ADL scale, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) values.RESULTS: There were 109 patients with AD and 53 nondemented individuals (81.4 ± 4.6 years). The sensitivity of ADL scale or IADL-4 item or the MMSE was low (52%-57%). The most efficient AD classification used both the IADLs-4 item and the MOCA with a threshold score of 20. Besides age and memory scores, the main correlates of IADLs scale or ADLs scale were executive, neuropsychiatric, vascular, and extrapyramidal scores.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the Lawton IADLs-4 item scale and ADLs scale lack sensitivity to AD dementia in elderly people and support a better sensitivity of MOCA rather than MMSE and IADLs-4 item/ADLs at the expense of specificity."
"24577459","Post-stroke cognitive impairment: high prevalence and determining factors in a cohort of mild stroke.","BACKGROUND: Because of the aging population and a rise in the number of stroke survivors, the prevalence of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) is increasing.OBJECTIVE: To identify the factors associated with 3-month PSCI.METHODS: All consecutive stroke patients without pre-stroke dementia, mild cognitive disorders, or severe aphasia hospitalized in the Neurology Department of Dijon, University Hospital, France (November 2010 - February 2012) were included in this prospective cohort study. Demographics, vascular risk factors, and stroke data were collected. A first cognitive evaluation was performed during the hospitalization using the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA). Patients assessable at 3 months were categorized as cognitively impaired if the MMSE score was =26/30 and MOCA &lt;26/30 or if the neuropsychological battery confirmed PSCI when the MMSE and MOCA were discordant. Multivariable logistic models were used to determine factors associated with 3-month PSCI.RESULTS: Among the 280 patients included, 220 were assessable at 3 months. The overall frequency of 3-month PSCI was 47.3%, whereas that of dementia was 7.7%. In multivariable analyses, 3-month PSCI was associated with age, low education level, a history of diabetes mellitus, acute confusion, silent infarcts, and functional handicap at discharge. MMSE and MOCA scores during hospitalization were associated with 3-month PSCI (OR = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.54-0.74; p &lt; 0.0001 and OR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.59-0.76; p &lt; 0.0001, respectively).CONCLUSION: Our study underlines the high frequency of PSCI in a cohort of mild stroke. The early cognitive diagnosis of stroke patients could be useful by helping physicians to identify those at a high risk of developing PSCI."
"24498389","Abnormal intrinsic brain activity patterns in patients with subcortical ischemic vascular dementia.","OBJECTIVES: To investigate the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) alteration of whole brain in patients with subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with SIVD and 35 control subjects were included in this study. All of them underwent structural MRI and rs-fMRI scan. The structural data were processed using the voxel-based morphometry 8 toolbox (VBM8). The rs-fMRI data were processed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) and Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF) software. Within-group analysis was performed with a one-sample Student's t-test to identify brain regions with ALFF value larger than the mean. Intergroup analysis was performed with a two-sample Student's t-test to identify ALFF differences of whole brain between SIVD and control subjects. Partial correlations between ALFF values and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were analyzed in the SIVD group across the parameters of age, gender, years of education, and GM volume.RESULTS: Within-group analysis showed that the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), inferior parietal lobe (IPL), occipital lobe, and adjacent precuneus had significantly higher standardized ALFF values than the global mean ALFF value in both groups. Compared to the controls, patients with SIVD presented lower ALFF values in the bilateral precuneus and higher ALFF values in the bilateral ACC, left insula and hippocampus. Including GM volume as an extra covariate, the ALFF inter-group difference exhibited highly similar spatial patterns to those without GM volume correcting. Close negative correlations were found between the ALFF values of left insula and the MoCA and MMSE scores of SIVD patients.CONCLUSION: SIVD is associated with a unique spontaneous aberrant activity of rs-fMRI signals, and measurement of ALFF in the precuneus, ACC, insula, and hippocampus may aid in the detection of SIVD."
"24472343","A Bahasa Malaysia version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment: validation in stroke.","BACKGROUND: Many stroke research trials do not include assessment of cognitive function. A Very Early Rehabilitation Trial (AVERT) is an international multicenter study that includes the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as an outcome. At the Malaysian AVERT site, completion of the MoCA has been limited by low English proficiency in some participants. We aimed to develop a Bahasa Malaysia (BM) version of the MoCA and to validate it in a stroke population.METHODS: The original English version of the MoCA was translated into BM and then back-translated to ensure accuracy. Feasibility testing in a group of stroke patients prompted minor changes to the BM MoCA. In the validation phase, a larger group of bilingual stroke patients completed both the original English MoCA and the finalized BM MoCA, with presentation order counter-balanced.RESULTS: Forty stroke patients participated, with a mean age of 57.2 (SD = 10.3). Agreement between BM MoCA and English MoCA was strong (intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.81, 95% CI 0.68-0.90). Scores on BM MoCA were slightly higher than scores on English MoCA (median absolute difference = 2.0, IQR 0-3.5), and this difference was present regardless of which version was completed first.CONCLUSIONS: The existence of a validated BM version of the MoCA will be of major benefit to clinicians and researchers in Malaysia and the wider South-east Asian region, where the Malay language is used by over 200 million people."

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is accepted as a valid screening tool for mild cognitive impairment due to cerebral ischaemia. Whether MoCA is independently associated with excellent outcome [a score of 0 on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) or 18/18 on the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale] 1 year after aSAH was assessed.METHODS: Hong Kong Chinese aSAH patients were assessed prospectively by means of the MoCA, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), mRS and IADL scale at 1 year. This multicenter prospective observational study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov of the US National Institutes of Health (NCT01038193).RESULTS: In all, 194 patients completed the assessments at 1 year. After adjustment for age, both excellent IADL and mRS outcomes were associated with MoCA (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.3, P &lt; 0.001, and OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.2, P = 0.001, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: MoCA-assessed cognitive function is an important determinant for excellent outcomes after aSAH."
"24462461","Improvement of cognitive function after carotid endarterectomy--a new strategy for the evaluation of cognitive function.","Significant carotid stenosis is known to cause ischemic stroke and cognitive impairment. However, it remains controversial whether carotid endarterectomy (CEA) can improve cognitive function in patients with carotid stenosis. We used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) to compare cognitive function between before and after CEA. Patients were prospectively registered to evaluate cognitive function from October 2011 to December 2012 after we determined them to have significant carotid stenosis. Patients were examined by 3-dimensional computed tomographic angiography or digital subtraction angiography. Although symptomatic cases were included, their modified Rankin Scale was grade 0 or 1 before CEA. All CEA procedures were performed by the same neurosurgical team. Cognitive function was evaluated by MoCA and MMSE performed before and after surgery. Data were analyzed statistically using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Thirty-six patients were included in this study. The MoCA score after surgery, whereas the MMSE score was not. After surgery, the MoCA score improved in patients who were 73 years or younger, who underwent CEA in the left side of their carotid lesion, who had severe carotid stenosis of more than 80%, who had bilateral lesion, who did not have abnormal lesion on diffusion-weighted imaging after surgery, or who had cerebral blood flow of pre-CEA over 34.5 mL. In conclusion, MoCA was feasible in patients soon after undergoing CEA. Using MoCA not MMSE, CEA may improve cognitive function in patients with significant carotid stenosis. "
"24444381","Functioning of long-term survivors of first-ever intracerebral hemorrhage.","OBJECTIVES: There are few data on long-term functional outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We aimed to assess functional dependency and cognitive impairment in long-term survivors of first-ever intracerebral hemorrhage.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between August and November 2011, we contacted all survivors from a cohort of 134 consecutive patients hospitalized with a first-ever ICH in the period 2005-2009 in a well-defined catchment area. We did an extensive face-to-face follow-up including the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), the Barthel Index (BI), and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).RESULTS: Fifty-one patients (38%) were alive. Fifty agreed to take part in the follow-up. The median follow-up time was 3.8 years. Thirty-four patients (68%) were independent (mRS 0-2) and 16 (32%) dependent (mRS 3-5). Factors independently associated with dependency were leukoaraiosis score (OR 2.3 per increasing point, P = 0.003) and female sex (OR 5.1, P = 0.038). Twenty-seven patients (61%) had cognitive impairment (MoCA = 23). Factors independently associated with cognitive impairment were age (OR 2.4 per 10 years, P = 0.010) and lobar ICH location (OR 14.1, P = 0.016).CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of long-term survivors of ICH in Southern Norway live functionally independent lives in their private homes. Dependency is linked to leukoaraiosis and female sex. Cognitive impairment is common and linked to lobar location of ICH."
"24443573","[Hungarian version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) for screening mild cognitive impairment].","Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be considered as an intermediate stage between normal cognitive aging and dementia. Its screening is extremely important because within a year in 15-20% of cases dementia can evolve. In Hungary, the most widely used screening tool for both dementia and MCI is the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), which is often criticized for its poor screening sensitivity of mild dementia and MCI. To eliminate this problem, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was developed, especially for screening MCI. Our study presents the first results with the Hungarian translation of MoCA. We used Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) for controlling depression. In MoCA the cutoff score between healthy and MCI persons was 24 out of 30. MoCA was more sensitive in detecting MCI than MMSE and its inner consistency was also slightly higher. Specificity of the tests to detect MCI was similar. The results on BDI were not related to either MoCA or MMSE. Our results suggest that MoCA can be a useful tool to detect cognitive decline. "
"24423626","Improving screening for vascular cognitive impairment at three to six months after mild ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack.","BACKGROUND: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were compared with and without the addition of a brief processing speed test, the symbol digit modalities test (SDMT), for vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) screening at three to six months after stroke.METHODS: Patients with ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack were assessed with MoCA and MMSE, as well as a formal neuropsychological battery three to six months after stroke. VCI was defined by impairment in any cognitive domain on neuropsychological testing. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to compare test discriminatory ability.RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-nine patients out of 327 (58%) had VCI, of whom 180 (95%) had vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI), and nine (5%) had dementia. The overall AUCs of the MoCA and MMSE scores and performance at their respective cut-off points were equivalent in detecting VCI (AUCs: 0.87 (95% CI 0.83-0.91) vs. 0.84 (95% CI 0.80-0.88), p = 0.13; cut-offs: MoCA (=23) vs. MMSE (=26), sensitivity: 0.78 vs. 0.71; specificity: 0.80 vs. 0.82; positive predictive value: 0.84 vs. 0.84; negative predictive value: 0.72 vs. 0.67; and correctly classified 78.6% vs. 75.5%; p = 0.42). The AUCs of MMSE and MoCA were improved significantly by the SDMT (AUCs: MMSE+SDMT 0.90 (95% CI 0.87-0.93), p &lt;0.001; MoCA+SDMT 0.91 (95% CI 0.88-0.94), p &lt; 0.02).CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA and MMSE are equivalent and moderately sensitive, and can be supplemented with the SDMT to improve their accuracy in VCI screening."
"24404822","Psychometric properties of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA): an analysis using the Rasch model.","In the present study we analyzed the psychometric characteristics of the MoCA (Portuguese version) using the Rasch model for dichotomous items. The total sample comprised of 897 participants distributed between two main subgroups: (I) healthy group that was comprised of 650 cognitively healthy community dwellers and (II) clinical group that was comprised of 90 patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment, 90 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 33 patients with frontotemporal dementia, and 34 patients with vascular dementia recruited at a reference dementia clinic. All patients were investigated through a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, laboratory tests essential to exclude a reversible form of dementia, imaging studies (CT or MRI and SPECT or FDG-PET), Apolipoprotein E allele genotyping and CSF biomarker (Aß42,Tau, and P-tau) analyses. The clinical diagnosis was established through the consensus of a multidisciplinary team, based on international criteria. The results demonstrated an overall good fit of both items and the person's values, a high variability on cognitive performance level, and a good quality of the measurements. The MoCA scores also demonstrated adequate discriminant validity, with high diagnostic value. DIF analyses indicated the generalized validity of the MoCA scores. In conclusion, the results of this study show the overall psychometric adequacy of the MoCA and verify the discriminant and generalized validity of the obtained results. "

Our cognitive performance examination consisted of the battery of tests including Luria memory words test, Shulte's tables, semantic and phonemic fluency test, the clock drawing test and Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA). Postural function and balance control were assessed by computerized static (&quot;Stabilan 01&quot; Russia) and dynamic (&quot;Gravistat&quot;, Belarus) stabiloplatforms using a biofeedback principle.RESULTS: In the static stabiloplatform examination more pronounced postural instability in VaMCI patients was evidenced by larger gravity center displacement radius (p &lt; 0.05) and confidence ellipse area (p &lt; 0.05). In the dynamic stabiloplatform examination it was manifested by the reduced number of errors as attempts to maintain postural stability (p &lt; 0.0001), a decrease in the error rate (p &lt; 0.0001) and increase in the average time of a postural response as time spent for one error (p &lt; 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical postural instability detected by the stabiloplatform examinations may be of value in earlier VaMCI diagnosis."

Seventy Cantonese-speaking healthy individuals participated to establish normative data and 46 chronic stroke survivors were assessed using the HK-OCS, Albert's Test of Visual Neglect, short test of gestural production, and Hong Kong version of the following assessments: Western Aphasia Battery, MMSE, MoCA, Modified Barthel Index, and Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale. The validity of the HK-OCS was appraised by the difference between the two participant groups. Neurologically unimpaired individuals performed significantly better than stroke survivors on the HK-OCS. Positive and significant correlations found between cognitive subtests in the HK-OCS and related assessments indicated good concurrent validity. Excellent intra-rater and inter-rater reliabilities, fair test-retest reliability, and acceptable internal consistency suggested that the HK-OCS had good reliability. Specific HK-OCS subtests including semantics, episodic memory, number writing, and orientation were the best predictors of functional outcomes."
"26676517","Predicting return to work after subarachnoid hemorrhage using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).","BACKGROUND: Returning to work is a major issue for patients having had an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). It is important, at an early stage, to identify the patients that are unlikely to return to work. The objective of this study was to assess the predictive value of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at 6 months after ictus on return to work at 12 months.METHODS: In this prospective study were 96 patients with SAH included in the acute phase. Cognitive functions were assessed at 6 months using the MoCA and return to work at 12 months. The predictive value of MoCA on return to work was analyzed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve as well as logistic regression.RESULTS: Of those that had work before the SAH, 52 % were working at 12 months after the ictus. These patients had scored significantly better on MoCA at 6 months (p = 0.01). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.75. By using a cut-off on MoCA of &lt;27, 68 % of the patients could be correctly classified as returned/not returned to work. Adding data from the acute phase to the MoCA in a logistic regression model increased the percentage of patients correctly classified as returned/not returned to work by 2 %.CONCLUSIONS: Returning to work is a major issue for SAH patients. It is important to identify factors that may interfere with a patient's ability to return to work, and address these issues appropriately. In our study, estimating cognitive functions at 6 months after SAH using the MoCA alone allowed us to predict return to work correctly in 68 % of the cases. We feel that this provides useful information in planning rehabilitation, but that other post-SAH symptoms have to be considered as well."
"26666638","Carotid Endarterectomy and Carotid Artery Stenting Lead to Improved Cognitive Performance in Patients with Severe Carotid Artery Stenosis.","In patients with severe carotid artery stenosis, the effects of carotid artery reopening, achieved either by carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS), on cognitive functions remain elusive. Herein, we conducted a prospective study to determine whether and to what extent CEA and CAS affected cognitive performance. Patients admitted to the Department of Neurology or Vascular Surgery in Nanjing First Hospital from December 2012 to March 2015 with a diagnosis of severe carotid artery stenosis (&gt;70%) were included in the study. Among them, 77 patients underwent CEA, 81 patients underwent CAS, and 77 patients who refused to receive aforementioned interventions were enrolled in control group. Of note, all patients in this study received basic pharmacological treatment according to the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines. Cognitive functions were evaluated by a broad spectrum of neuropsychological tests including the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and event related potential P300 on the day prior to and at 3 months after indicated intervention. When compared with basic pharmacological treatment, both CEA and CAS significantly increased the scores of MMSE and MoCA at 3 months following procedures. Meanwhile, a significant reduction of P300 score was also observed in patients underwent CEA or CAS. In addition, the changes in MMSE, MoCA and P300 scores over time between CEA and CAS groups were not statistically significant. Taken together, our findings suggest an improvement of cognitive functions following carotid artery reopening. Meanwhile, the beneficial effects of CEA and CAS on cognitive performance seem to be equivalent. "
"26647490","Aggressive surgical interventions for severe stroke: Impact on quality of life, caregiver burden and family outcomes.","INTRODUCTION: Decompressive hemicraniectomy, clot evacuation, and aneurysmal interventions are considered aggressive surgical therapeutic options for treatment of massive cerebral artery infarction (MCA), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and severe subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) respectively. Although these procedures are saving lives, little is actually known about the impact on outcomes other than short-term survival and functional status. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of personal and social consequences of surviving these aggressive surgical interventions in order to aid acute care clinicians in helping family members make difficult decisions about undertaking such interventions.METHODS: An exploratory mixed method study using a convergent parallel design was conducted to examine functional recovery (NIHSS, mRS &amp; BI), cognitive status (Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale, MoCA), quality of life (Euroqol 5-D), and caregiver outcomes (Bakas Caregiver Outcome Scale, BCOS) in a cohort of patients and families who had undergone aggressive surgical intervention for severe stroke between the years 2000-2007 Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, univariate and multivariate analysis of variance, and multivariate logistic regression. Content analysis was used to analyze the qualitative interviews conducted with stroke survivors and family members.RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients and 13 spouses participated in this study. Based on patient MOCA scores, overall cognitive status was 25.18 (range 23.4-26.9); current functional outcomes scores: NIHSS 2.22, mRS 1.74, and BI 88.5. EQ-5D scores revealed no significant differences between patients and caregivers (p = 0.585) and caregiver outcomes revealed no significant diferences between male/female caregivers or patient diagnostic group (MCA, SAH, ICH; p = 0.103).DISCUSSION: Overall, patients and families were satisfied with quality of life and decisions made at the time of the initial stroke. There was consensus among study participants that formal community-based support (e.g., handibus, caregiving relief, rehabilitation assessments) should be continued for extended periods (e.g, years)post-stroke. Ongoing contact with health care professionals is valuable to help them navigate in the community as needs change over time."
"26588918","Domain-specific versus generalized cognitive screening in acute stroke.","Cognitive assessments after stroke are typically short form tests developed for dementia that generates pass/fail classifications (e.g. the MoCA). The Oxford Cognitive Screen (OCS) provides a domain-specific cognitive profile designed for stroke survivors. This study compared the use of the MoCA and the OCS in acute stroke with respect to symptom specificity and aspects of clinical utility. A cross-sectional study with a consecutive sample of 200 stroke patients within 3 weeks of stroke completing MoCA and OCS. Demographic data, lesion side and Barthel scores were recorded. Inclusivity was assessed in terms of completion rates and reasons for non-completion were evaluated. The incidence of cognitive impairments on both the MoCA and OCS sub-domains was calculated and differences in stroke specificity, cognitive profiles and independence of the measures were addressed. The incidence of acute cognitive impairment was high: 76% of patients were impaired on MoCA, and 86% demonstrated at least one impairment on the cognitive domains assessed in the OCS. OCS was more sensitive than MoCA overall (87 vs 78% sensitivity) and OCS alone provided domain-specific information on prevalent post-stroke cognitive impairments (neglect, apraxia and reading/writing ability). Unlike the MOCA, the OCS was not dominated by left hemisphere impairments but gave differentiated profiles across the contrasting domains. The OCS detects important cognitive deficits after stroke not assessed in the MoCA, it is inclusive for patients with aphasia and neglect and it is less confounded by co-occurring difficulties in these domains."
"26585396","Stroke Location Is an Independent Predictor of Cognitive Outcome.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: On top of functional outcome, accurate prediction of cognitive outcome for stroke patients is an unmet need with major implications for clinical management. We investigated whether stroke location may contribute independent prognostic value to multifactorial predictive models of functional and cognitive outcomes.METHODS: Four hundred twenty-eight consecutive patients with ischemic stroke were prospectively assessed with magnetic resonance imaging at 24 to 72 hours and at 3 months for functional outcome using the modified Rankin Scale and cognitive outcome using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Statistical maps of functional and cognitive eloquent regions were derived from the first 215 patients (development sample) using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping. We used multivariate logistic regression models to study the influence of stroke location (number of eloquent voxels from voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping maps), age, initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and stroke volume on modified Rankin Scale and MoCA. The second part of our cohort was used as an independent replication sample.RESULTS: In univariate analyses, stroke location, age, initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and stroke volume were all predictive of poor modified Rankin Scale and MoCA. In multivariable analyses, stroke location remained the strongest independent predictor of MoCA and significantly improved the prediction compared with using only age, initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and stroke volume (area under the curve increased from 0.697-0.771; difference=0.073; 95% confidence interval, 0.008-0.155). In contrast, stroke location did not persist as independent predictor of modified Rankin Scale that was mainly driven by initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (area under the curve going from 0.840 to 0.835). Similar results were obtained in the replication sample.CONCLUSIONS: Stroke location is an independent predictor of cognitive outcome (MoCA) at 3 months post stroke."
"26564912","Treatment Modalities for Small Saphenous Vein Insufficiency: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.","PURPOSE: To investigate and compare the anatomical success rates and complications of the treatment modalities for small saphenous vein (SSV) incompetence.METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library on the following therapies for incompetence of SSVs: surgery, endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS), steam ablation, and mechanochemical endovenous ablation (MOCA). The search found 49 articles (5 randomized controlled trials, 44 cohort studies) reporting on the different treatment modalities: surgery (n=9), EVLA (n=28), RFA (n=9), UGFS (n=6), and MOCA (n=1). A random-effects model was used to estimate the primary outcome of anatomical success, which was defined as closure of the treated vein on follow-up duplex ultrasound imaging. The estimate is reported with the 95% confidence interval (CI). Secondary outcomes were technical success and major complications [paresthesia and deep vein thrombosis (DVT)], given as the weighted means.RESULTS: The pooled anatomical success rate was 58.0% (95% CI 40.9% to 75.0%) for surgery in 798 SSVs, 98.5% (95% CI 97.7% to 99.2%) for EVLA in 2950 SSVs, 97.1% (95% CI 94.3% to 99.9%) for RFA in 386 SSVs, and 63.6% (95% CI 47.1% to 80.1%) for UGFS in 494 SSVs. One study reported results of MOCA, with an anatomical success rate of 94%. Neurologic complications were most frequently reported after surgery (mean 19.6%) and thermal ablation (EVLA: mean 4.8%; RFA: mean 9.7%). Deep venous thrombosis was a rare complication (0% to 1.2%).CONCLUSION: Endovenous thermal ablation (EVLA/RFA) should be preferred to surgery and foam sclerotherapy in the treatment of SSV incompetence. Although data on nonthermal techniques in SSV are still sparse, the potential benefits, especially the reduced risk of nerve injury, might be of considerable clinical importance."

Patients were divided into two groups according to MoCA scores: (1) cognitive dysfunction and (2) normal cognitive function. We compared the clinical information with univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses and identified major risk factors related to cognitive impairment in CCCI.RESULTS: Age (p=0.007, OR=3.768, <U+03C7>2=7.173), leukoaraiosis (p=0.002, OR=6.231, <U+03C7>2=9.478), a history of hypertension (p=0.021, OR=3.078, <U+03C7>2=5.307), a history of hyperlipidemia (p=0.016, OR=3.429, <U+03C7>2=5.795), and the number of vascular risk factors (p=0.019, <U+03C7>2=9.921) were related to cognitive impairment by univariate analysis. Age (p=0.070, OR=2.689, 95% CI=0.923±7.837) and leukoaraiosis (p=0.012, OR=4.531, 95% CI=1.401±14.667) were significant by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Age (r=-0.585, p&lt;0.01) had a marked negative correlation with MoCA scores. There were significant differences in the MoCA subscale scores, including visuospatial and executive capacity (p&lt;0.01), attention and calculation (p&lt;0.01), and delayed recall (p&lt;0.01), in patients with different degrees of leukoaraiosis. Patients with CCCI had a higher incidence of cognitive impairment (78.4%).CONCLUSIONS: Changes in visuospatial and executive capacity, delayed recall, and language function represent cognitive manifestations in CCCI. Age and leukoaraiosis have the strongest effects on cognitive impairment morbidity and can aggravate cognitive impairment."
"26556699","Glue, steam and Clarivein--Best practice techniques and evidence.","In July 2013, the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommended &quot;endothermal&quot; ablation (meaning endovenous thermal ablation) is the first line treatment for truncal venous reflux in varicose veins. The initial endovenous thermoablation devices were radiofrequency ablation and endovenous laser ablation. More recently, Glue (cyanoacrylate), endovenous steam and Clarivein (mechanochemical ablation or MOCA) have entered the market as new endovenous techniques for the treatment of varicose veins. Glue and Clarivein do not require tumescent anaesthesia and do not use heat and therefore termed non-tumescent non-thermal (NTNT). Steam both requires tumescence and is also a thermal technique (TT).

"26556208","Temporal stability and responsiveness of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment following acquired brain injury.","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the temporal stability and responsiveness of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in acquired brain injury (ABI).RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: English-speaking adults with stroke or moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury were administered alternate forms of the MoCA (version 1, then 2), 6 weeks apart. Chronic group participants (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>40) were community-dwelling, at least 1 year post-ABI (mean<U+2009>=<U+2009>12.1 years, SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>9.0), and presumed clinically stable. Sub-acute group participants (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>36) were 30.8 days post-ABI (SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>12.4) and were undergoing intensive rehabilitation. Individuals with an unstable medical or psychiatric condition or severe receptive aphasia were not eligible.RESULTS: The chronic group scored 21.6 (SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.5) initially and 22.7 (SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>3.8) on the second administration, demonstrating a small but significant practise effect (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.009). The Pearson test-re-test correlation coefficient was 0.83. Using reliable change methodology in the chronic group, the 80% confidence interval (CI) for change across the two administrations was -2 to +4, adjusting for practise. Applied to the sub-acute group, 39% improved and 0% declined.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA is a brief standardized tool that appears useful for monitoring cognitive change after ABI. The findings enable clinicians to detect statistically reliable change across serial MoCA administrations in individuals with an ABI."
"26515085","The role of human kallikrein 6, clusterin and adiponectin as potential blood biomarkers of dementia.","OBJECTIVES: Progressive degenerative syndromes which affect brain, altering memory, behavior, cognition and emotion, are commonly defined as dementia. It was suggested that serum human kallikrein 6 (KLK6), clusterin (CLU) and adiponectin (ADPN) in combination with inflammation markers, neuroimaging and neuropsychological testing could assist in discriminating dementia patients from control individuals. Our aim was therefore to compare serum concentrations of KLK6, CLU and ADPN and inflammatory marker, interleukin-6 (IL-6), in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD), patients with vascular dementia (VAD), cognitively healthy participants (CHP) and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum samples were collected from AD, VAD and MCI patients admitted to the University Department of Neurology (Zagreb, Croatia) for regular follow-up. All patients underwent standard neuroimaging procedures including brain CT, neurosonological assessment with intima-media thickness (IMT) and breath holding index (BHI) calculations. Cognitive abilities were tested using standard Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Concentrations of KLK6, CLU, ADPN and IL-6 were determined in all serum samples.RESULTS: We have recruited a total of 235 participants, divided in 4 groups: AD (N=70), VAD (N=67), MCI (N=48) and CHP (N=50). Serum concentrations of KLK6 (P=0.137), CLU (P=0.178) and ADPN (P=0.268) did not differ between AD, VAD, MCI and cognitively healthy control group of participants, whereas IL-6 was significantly higher in VAD patients than in AD, MCI and CHP individuals (P=0.014). There was no association between investigated biomarkers and clinical patient parameters.CONCLUSIONS: Serum concentrations of KLK6, CLU and ADPN do not differ between AD, VAD and controls with and without mild cognitive impairment. Higher IL-6 levels in VAD group point to the inflammatory component in the development of vascular dementia. Investigated biomarkers are not associated with neuroimaging findings and neuropsychological patient data."
"26470772","Montreal Cognitive Assessment: One Cutoff Never Fits All.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to examine the discrepancy between single versus age and education corrected cutoff scores in classifying performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack.METHODS: MoCA norms were collected from 794 functionally independent and stroke- and dementia-free persons aged =65 years. magnetic resonance imaging was used to exclude healthy controls with significant brain pathology and medial temporal lobe atrophy. Cutoff scores at 16th, 7th, and 2nd percentiles by age and education were derived for the MoCA and MoCA 5-minute Protocol. MoCA performance in 919 patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack was classified using the single and norm-derived cutoff scores.RESULTS: The norms for the Hong Kong version of the MoCA total and domain scores and the total score of the MoCA 5-minute protocol are described. Only 65.1% and 25.7% healthy controls and 45.2% and 19.0% patients scored above the conventional cutoff scores of 21/22 and 25/26 on the MoCA. Using classification with norm-derived cutoff scores as reference, locally derived cutoff score of 21/22 yielded a classification discrepancy of =42.4%. Discrepancy increased with higher age and lower education level, with the majority being false positives by single cutoffs. With the 25/26 cutoff of the original MoCA, discrepancy further increased to =74.3%.CONCLUSIONS: Conventional single cutoff scores are associated with substantially high rates of misclassification especially in older and less-educated patients with stroke. These results caution against the use of one-size-fits-all cutoffs on the MoCA."
"26461878","What are the correlates of cognition and participation to return to work after first ever mild stroke?","BACKGROUND: The percentage of working age people with mild stroke has risen. Evidence indicates that even mild stroke impact cognition, executive functioning, and daily functioning, consequently affecting participation, quality of life (QoL) and return to work (RTW).OBJECTIVES: (1) Compare cognition, participation and QoL between people 3 months post-mild stroke who RTW and those who did not; and (2) To determine the correlates of these variables to RTW of participants 3 months post-stroke.METHODS: We visited at home 163 stroke survivors (117 men, 46 women) 3 months post-mild stroke ranging from 50 to 89 years. Participants who returned to work (n = 114) and those who did not (n = 49). Data collection at home included measures for cognitive status (MoCA), executive functions (EFPT, DEX), depression (GDS), participation (RNL), and QoL (SIS recovery).RESULTS: Significant differences were found between RTW participants and those who did not RTW in measures of cognition, depression, participation and QoL (t<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.36 to -<U+2009>5.62, P &lt; 0.022-0.001). No difference was found on age or gender. Stepwise regression showed that significant correlates of RTW were participation (RNL), executive functions (EFPT), and QoL (SIS recovery).CONCLUSIONS: To enable RTW after mild stroke, participation, executive functions and QoL must be considered in planning interventions."
"26459220","Exploring the effects of coexisting amyloid in subcortical vascular cognitive impairment.","BACKGROUND: Mixed pathology, particularly Alzheimer's disease with cerebrovascular lesions, is reported as the second most common cause of dementia. Research on mixed dementia typically includes people with a primary AD diagnosis and hence, little is known about the effects of co-existing amyloid pathology in people with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). The purpose of this study was to understand whether individual differences in amyloid pathology might explain variations in cognitive impairment among individuals with clinical subcortical VCI (SVCI).METHODS: Twenty-two participants with SVCI completed an (11)C Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) position emission tomography (PET) scan to quantify global amyloid deposition. Cognitive function was measured using: 1) MOCA; 2) ADAS-Cog; 3) EXIT-25; and 4) specific executive processes including a) Digits Forward and Backwards Test, b) Stroop-Colour Word Test, and c) Trail Making Test. To assess the effect of amyloid deposition on cognitive function we conducted Pearson bivariate correlations to determine which cognitive measures to include in our regression models. Cognitive variables that were significantly correlated with PIB retention values were entered in a hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis to determine the unique effect of amyloid on cognitive function. We controlled for age, education, and ApoE e4 status.RESULTS: Bivariate correlation results showed that PIB binding was significantly correlated with ADAS-Cog (p &lt; 0.01) and MOCA (p &lt; 0.01); increased PIB binding was associated with worse cognitive function on both cognitive measures. PIB binding was not significantly correlated with the EXIT-25 or with specific executive processes (p &gt; 0.05). Regression analyses controlling for age, education, and ApoE e4 status indicated an independent association between PIB retention and the ADAS-Cog (adjusted R-square change of 15.0%, Sig F Change = 0.03). PIB retention was also independently associated with MOCA scores (adjusted R-Square Change of 27.0%, Sig F Change = 0.02).CONCLUSION: We found that increased global amyloid deposition was significantly associated with greater memory and executive dysfunctions as measured by the ADAS-Cog and MOCA. Our findings point to the important role of co-existing amyloid deposition for cognitive function in those with a primary SVCI diagnosis. As such, therapeutic approaches targeting SVCI must consider the potential role of amyloid for the optimal care of those with mixed dementia.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01027858."

The surgical shunting of the intervention area may reduce the risk of the intraoperative ipsilateral cerebral ischemia following the carotid artery clamping but is controversial. The goal of this study was to compare the cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctO2) and early changes of cognitive functions in CEE in the settings of transient vascular bypass and without this method.</AbstractText>: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTVE: Carotid endarterectomy (CEE) is an effective surgical technique to prevent cerebral ischemia and stroke, but can be associated with intervention-related complications. The surgical shunting of the intervention area may reduce the risk of the intraoperative ipsilateral cerebral ischemia following the carotid artery clamping but is controversial. The goal of this study was to compare the cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctO2) and early changes of cognitive functions in CEE in the settings of transient vascular bypass and without this method.METHODS: 45 adult patients were randomized to either the bypass group (the Bypass group, n = 24) or the Controls / No Bypass (the Control group, n = 21). All patients were monitored for invasive arterial pressure, SpO, EtCO,, and cerebral oxygenation (SctO2, Fore-Sight, CASMED, USA) over the contra- and ipsilateral frontal head areas. The cognitive functions were assessed using series of Montreal Cognitive Assessment score (MoCA) before the intervention, and on 6 and 36 hrs after the CEE.RESULTS: We did not find intergroup differences in the surgery duration, degree of stenosis and baseline cognitive function. The values of SctO2 reduced significantly only above contralateral side; these changes were attenuated in the shunt group. There were no intergroup differences in postoperative cognitive function.CONCLUSION: Empiric transient vascular bypass during carotid endarterectomy did not result in significant changes of the ipsilateral cerebral oxygenation, hyperperfusion and cognitive function, but attenuated the decrease of SctO2 over the contralateral hemisphere."
"26413475","Structural and physiological MRI correlates of occult cerebrovascular disease in late-onset epilepsy.","Late-onset epilepsy (LOE), with onset after 50 years of age, is often attributed to underlying occult cerebrovascular disease. LOE is associated with a three-fold increase in subsequent stroke risk, therefore it is important to improve our understanding of pathophysiology. In this exploratory study, we aimed to determine whether established structural magnetic resonance imaging markers and novel physiological imaging markers of occult cerebrovascular disease were more common in patients with LOE than age-matched controls. Sixteen patients with LOE (mean age ± SD: 67.6 ± 6.5 years) and 15 age-matched control subjects (mean age: 65.1 ± 3.9 years) underwent a 3 T MRI scan protocol. T1-weighted images and T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images were used to determine cortical grey matter volume and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume respectively, whilst multiple delay time arterial spin labelling (ASL) images were collected at rest and during a hypercapnic challenge. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and arterial arrival time (AAT) were calculated from ASL data under both normocapnic and hypercapnic conditions. Cerebrovascular reactivity was also calculated for both CBF and AAT relative to the change in end-tidal CO2. Patients with LOE were found to have significantly lower cortical volume than control subjects (33.8 ± 3.8% of intracranial volume vs. 38.0 ± 5.5%, p = 0.02) and significantly higher WMH volume (1339 ± 1408 mm3 vs. 514 ± 481 mm3, p = 0.047). Baseline whole brain AAT was found to be significantly prolonged in patients with LOE in comparison to control subjects (1539 ± 129 ms vs. 1363 ± 167 ms, p = 0.005). Voxel-based analysis showed the significant prolongation of AAT to be predominantly distributed in the frontal and temporal lobes. Voxel-based morphometry showed the lower cortical volume to be localised primarily to temporal lobes. No significant differences in CBF or cerebrovascular reactivity were found between the two groups. Baseline whole brain AAT and cortical volume differences persisted upon further analysis to take account of differences in smoking history between patients and control subjects. These findings suggest that occult cerebrovascular disease is relevant to the pathophysiology of LOE."
"26313037","Cognitive impairment and gray matter volume abnormalities in silent cerebral infarction.","To investigate the association between cognitive impairment and gray matter volume (GMV) abnormalities in silent cerebral infarction (SCI) patients, the GMV of 62 pairs of patients and well-matched healthy controls was calculated. All participants underwent a P300 test, a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test. Compared with controls, the patients showed decreased GMV in the left superior frontal gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, and bilateral parahippocampal gyrus; no significantly increasing GMV was found. The volumes of the frontal and temporal lobes were positively correlated with the score of the MoCA scale and P300 amplitudes (r=0.62, P&lt;0.01). The P300 latency was negatively correlated with the volumes of the frontal lobe, the temporal lobe, and the hippocampus (r=-0.71, P&lt;0.05). No significant correlations between the GMV of the abnormal brain regions and four clinical characteristics in SCI patients were found, suggesting that cognitive deficiency existed in SCI patients and the reduced GMV might contribute to the pathology of cognitive deficiency in SCI patients."

In this study, we compared MMSE with MoCA in patients with DR and searched for an association between the severity of DR and cognitive impairment (CI).METHODS: This cross-sectional study comprised 120 consecutive patients with diabetes. Patients were divided into four groups as no DR, mild DR, severe nonproliferative DR (PDR) and PDR. Each group consisted 30 inviduals. CI was assessed using the MMSE and MoCA.RESULTS: The number of subjects with a score&gt;21 were significantly lower on the MoCA than on the MMSE between groups (all P&lt;0.05). The mean MoCA score was significantly lower than the MMSE score (P&lt;0.001) There was a linear association between the grade of DR and a score&lt;21 on both tests,CONCLUSION: MoCA provides more insight into the cognitive function in DR."
"26285662","Cognitive outcome in acute simvastatin treatment for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: A propensity matched analysis.","OBJECTIVES: Experimental evidence has indicated the benefit of simvastatin in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Recently, acute simvastatin treatment was not shown to be beneficial in neurological outcome using modified Rankin Scale. Cognitive function is another important dimension of outcome assessment and yet had not been investigated in statin studies for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. We therefore explored whether acute simvastatin treatment would improve cognitive outcomes.METHODS: The study recruited SAH patients with acute simvastatin treatment enrolled in a randomized controlled double-blinded clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01038193). A control cohort of SAH patients without simvastatin treatment was identified with propensity score matching of age and admission grade. Primary outcome measure was Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Secondary outcome measures were delayed ischaemic deficit (DID), delayed cerebral infarction, modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).RESULTS: Fifty-one SAH patients with acute simvastatin treatment and 51 SAH patients without simvastatin treatment were recruited for analysis. At 3 months, there were no differences in MoCA scores (MoCA: 21+/-6 vs. 21+/-5, p=0.772). MoCA-assessed cognitive impairment (MoCA&lt;26) was not different (75% vs. 80%, OR 0.7, 95%CI 0.3 to 1.8, p=0.477). There were also no differences in DID, delayed cerebral infarction, favorable mRS outcome, and MMSE scores, and MMSE-assessed cognitive impairment between both groups.CONCLUSIONS: The current study does not support that acute simvastatin treatment improves cognitive outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage."
"26179382","Call for uniform neuropsychological assessment after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: Swiss recommendations.","BACKGROUND: In a high proportion of patients with favorable outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), neuropsychological deficits, depression, anxiety, and fatigue are responsible for the inability to return to their regular premorbid life and pursue their professional careers. These problems often remain unrecognized, as no recommendations concerning a standardized comprehensive assessment have yet found entry into clinical routines.METHODS: To establish a nationwide standard concerning a comprehensive assessment after aSAH, representatives of all neuropsychological and neurosurgical departments of those eight Swiss centers treating acute aSAH have agreed on a common protocol. In addition, a battery of questionnaires and neuropsychological tests was selected, optimally suited to the deficits found most prevalent in aSAH patients that was available in different languages and standardized.RESULTS: We propose a baseline inpatient neuropsychological screening using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) between days 14 and 28 after aSAH. In an outpatient setting at 3 and 12 months after bleeding, we recommend a neuropsychological examination, testing all relevant domains including attention, speed of information processing, executive functions, verbal and visual learning/memory, language, visuo-perceptual abilities, and premorbid intelligence. In addition, a detailed assessment capturing anxiety, depression, fatigue, symptoms of frontal lobe affection, and quality of life should be performed.CONCLUSIONS: This standardized neuropsychological assessment will lead to a more comprehensive assessment of the patient, facilitate the detection and subsequent treatment of previously unrecognized but relevant impairments, and help to determine the incidence, characteristics, modifiable risk factors, and the clinical course of these impairments after aSAH."
"26133933","The Effects of Near-Infrared Spectroscopy on the Neurocognitive Functions in the Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting with Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Disease: A Randomized Prospective Study.","PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to research the use of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) on the neurocognitive functions in the patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with asymptomatic carotid artery disease.METHODS: The study design was carried out with the participation of 79 patients in a prospective, randomized and double blind control method. The patients were separated into two groups as NIRS (n = 43) and no NIRS (n = 36). A neurocognitive test was applied preoperatively and postoperatively to all patients before discharge. Cognitive functions were evaluated by applying the Montreal Cognitive Assessment test (MoCA).RESULTS: The decrease in the postoperative score of mean MoCA in no NIRS group was statistically significant when compared to preoperatively (p &lt;0.001). Postoperative mean MoCA score was found to be significantly higher in NIRS group (NIRS: 26.8 ± 1.9 vs. no NIRS: 23.6 ± 2.5, p &lt;0.001). It has been determined that there was a moderately positive significant correlation between the increase in the NIRS used patients (%) and increase in the MoCA score of the patients (r = 0.59, p &lt;0.001).CONCLUSION: Intraoperative NIRS usage in the patients undergoing CABG with carotid artery disease might be useful due to its postoperative positive effects on the cognitive functions."
"26119578","Screening and facilitating further assessment for cognitive impairment after stroke: application of a shortened Montreal Cognitive Assessment (miniMoCA).","PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to examine the performance of a shortened version of the MoCA (miniMoCA), as a clinical cognitive impairment screening tool in stroke rehabilitation patients.METHODS: Cognitive status was assessed using the MoCA and Cognistat in 72 patients. Agreement between the tests was assessed using the Kappa statistic. The sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of a miniMoCA to a MoCA score &lt;26 was also examined.RESULTS: A significant level of agreement was found between the MoCA and miniMoCA to the Cognistat in classifying patients by level of cognitive function. The miniMoCA showed a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 92% (PPV 98%, NPV 75%) to abnormal MoCA scores (&lt;26).CONCLUSIONS: This study extends the utility of the miniMoCA as an optimal brief screening tool for cognitive impairment in stroke patients. Further research is needed to determine the validity of the miniMoCA against a neuropsychological test.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: Although the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a recommended tool to screen for cognitive impairment in stroke patients, its lengthy administration can lead to inconsistent screening of patients for post-stroke cognitive function. In the current work, a shortened version of the MoCA (miniMoCA) was administered in a sample of stoke inpatients, utilizing only five of the eight original subtests. The proposed miniMoCA was found to streamline the administration of this screen test, while maintaining a heightened level of sensitivity for accurately identifying which patients do not require a more in-depth cognitive assessment."
"26088186","Cerebral Microbleeds and Cognitive Function in Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack Patients.","BACKGROUND: We explored the association between cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and cognitive impairment in patients with ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA).METHODS: A total of 488 ischemic stroke/TIA patients received magnetic resonance imaging. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to evaluate global cognitive function and cognitive domains. The association of CMB quantity with cognitive function and the impact of CMB locations (strictly lobar, strictly deep, and mixed regions) on cognitive impairment were examined in regression models with adjustments for confounders.RESULTS: A total of 113 subjects (23.2%) had =1 CMB. Strictly lobar, strictly deep, and mixed CMBs were identified in 36, 40, and 37 patients, respectively. The presence of =5 CMBs or strictly deep CMBs was associated with the MoCA total score (p = 0.007 and 0.020, respectively). Of all MoCA domains tested, a lower score in the attention domain was related to the presence of =5 CMBs (p = 0.014) and strictly deep CMBs (p = 0.028).CONCLUSION: CMBs were associated with cognitive dysfunction in stroke/TIA patients, especially in the attention domain. This association was mainly driven by CMBs in the deep region, underlining the role of hypertensive microangiopathy in stroke-related cognitive impairment."

However, the potential influence of CAS on cognitive function in patients with carotid artery stenosis and cerebral lacunar infarction has not been determined. This study investigated changes in cognitive function associated with CAS and the factors related to these changes.METHODS: This prospective cohort study comprised 579 Chinese patients with cerebral lacunar infarction and carotid artery stenosis for whom CAS was indicated, and a matched control group of 552 healthy individuals. Cognitive function before CAS and at scheduled intervals from 6 months to 3 years was assessed with instruments that included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale. Potential factors that might affect cognitive function were analyzed via logistic regression.RESULTS: The MMSE and MoCA scores of the patients before CAS were significantly lower than that of the control subjects. These scores were significantly higher 6 months after CAS and sustained or increased throughout the 3-year follow-up. Also significantly improved after CAS from baseline were scores for an alternating trail test, cube copying, clock-drawing, attention, and delayed recall in an auditory-verbal learning test. Logistic regression analyses showed that age greater than 65 y, little education, diabetes, and hypertension were independent risk factors for deteriorated MoCA scores 3 years after CAS.CONCLUSION: CAS was associated with significantly improved cognitive function in cerebral lacunar infarction patients with severe stenosis."
"26062587","[Diabetes and Dementia].","An aging global population is driving the current epidemic of dementia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetes is a known risk factor for the development of vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and mild cognitive impairment. Good control of diabetes may improve cognitive decline and prevent Alzheimer's disease. Mild cognitive impairment with type 2 diabetes (DM-MCI) often presents as a decline in attention, psychomotor speed, executive function, and memory. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is one of the best screening tools for detecting DM-MCI. We found that 72% of the patients admitted to educational hospitalization for type 2 diabetes could also be categorized into groups with frontal lobe dysfunction, delayed recall, and a mixed-type group. Anti-diabetic drugs and insulin may protect and improve cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and DM-MCI, but more studies are needed to verify this claim. Diabetes mellitus may be linked not only to Alzheimer's disease but also to other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's, Huntington's and frontotemporal lobe dementia. "

Subjects underwent neurologic and cognitive evaluation at baseline, pre-discharge and 30 days; cerebral diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 4 ± 2 days post-procedure and at 30 days. Technical success, which included complete 3-vessel cerebral coverage, was achieved in 88.9% (40/45) of cases. The primary in-hospital procedural safety endpoint (death, stroke, life-threatening or disabling bleeding, stage 2 or 3 acute kidney injury, or major vascular complications) occurred in 21.7% of TriGuard and 30.8% of control subjects (P = 0.34). In the Per Treatment population (subjects with complete three-vessel cerebral coverage), TriGuard use was associated with greater freedom from new ischaemic brain lesions (26.9 vs. 11.5%), fewer new neurologic deficits detected by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (3.1 vs. 15.4%), improved Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores, better performance on a delayed memory task (P = 0.028) at discharge, and a &gt;2-fold increase in recovery of normal cognitive function (MoCA score &gt;26) at 30 days.CONCLUSION: TriGuard cerebral protection during TAVI is safe and complete cerebral vessel coverage was achieved in 89% of subjects. In this exploratory study, subjects undergoing protected TAVI had more freedom from ischaemic brain lesions, fewer neurologic deficits, and improved cognitive function in some domains at discharge and 30 days compared with controls."
"25966900","Cognitive impairment is not a predictor of failure to adhere to anticoagulation of stroke patients with atrial fibrillation.","BACKGROUND: Oral anticoagulation (OAC) with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) is an effective strategy that is used for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, OAC is underused particularly in elderly patients, who are often physically disabled or cognitively impaired. We aimed at evaluating the effect of cognitive status and disability on OAC adherence 1 year after stroke or TIA.METHODS: In this prospective, single-center, observational study patients with ischemic stroke or TIA were consecutively included between 3/2011 and 9/2012. The detailed medical history, basic demographic variables, cardiovascular risk factors, stroke severity according to the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), medication including OAC were all recorded. Cognitive performance was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score at baseline. The functional status was assessed by recording activities and instrumental activities of daily living, respectively (ADL, IADL). After 12 months, patients had a follow-up visit to reassess the cognitive and functional status (MoCA, ADL and IADL) and to document the current use of OAC.RESULTS: In total, 12 months after the ischemic stroke or TIA AF had been diagnosed in 160/586 (27.3%). Of these, 151 patients (94.4%) were treated with OAC. OAC was performed using VKA in 79/151 (52.3%) and DOACs in 72/151 (47.7%). Cognitive impairment at 12 months follow-up was not associated with the absence of OAC treatment. However, regression analysis revealed that patients with AF with physical (ADL) and functional disability (IADL) were less likely to be treated with OAC (p = 0.08 and p = 0.04, respectively) 12 months after a stroke. None of these two factors, however, was independently associated with nonadherence to OAC 12 months after stroke. Although cognitive performance was similar in patients receiving VKA and direct anticoagulants (DOAC), adherence to VKA tended to be lower (82.6 vs. 94.6%, p = 0.12).CONCLUSIONS: In stroke and TIA patients with AF, the multifactorial medical and functional constellation rather than cognitive impairment specifically can be an obstacle for long-term OAC."
"25966264","Comparison of integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine therapy on vascular cognitive impairment with no dementia.","The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical effect of western medicine therapy assisted by Ginkgo biloba tablets (GBT) in patients with vascular cognitive impairment with no dementia (VCIND).

The conventional treatment group was provided with anti-platelet aggregation conventional treatment. In this group, 75 mg aspirin was given three times a day for 3 months, whereas the combined treatment group was given 19.2 mg GBT three times a day for 3 months along with conventional anti-platelet aggregation treatment. Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography were used to observe changes in cognitive ability and cerebral blood flow in patients with VCIND before and after treatment in the two groups. After 3 months of treatment, the MoCA scores of execution, attention, abstraction, delayed memory, and orientation were significantly increased in the combined treatment group compared with those before treatment and those in the control group after treatment. In addition, the blood flow velocity of the anterior cerebral artery was significantly increased in the combined treatment group. GBT can improve the therapeutic efficacy, cognitive ability, and cerebral blood flow supply of patients with VCIND. "
"25962184","Mild cognitive impairment: vascular risk factors in community elderly in four cities of Hebei Province, China.","BACKGROUND: Evidence has demonstrated that vascular risk factors (VRFs) contribute to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the elderly population. Because of the race and different diagnosis standard, there is still no definitive conclusions.OBJECTIVE: To estimate the VRFs and potential protective factors for MCI in elderly population living in the community in North China.METHODS: A total of 3136 participants entered the study. They were screened for hypertension, coronary heart disease (CHD), and cerebrovascular disease (CVD). Cognitive function was assessed with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The diagnosis of MCI was made according to Petersen's criteria. We investigated the relationship between vascular risk factors, potential protective factors and MCI.RESULTS: A total of 2511 (80%) participant belonged to normal group and 625 (20%) participants showed MCI. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that stroke and diabetes, but not hypertension or CHD was associated with MCI. Besides, exercise habit could lower the risk of MCI.CONCLUSIONS: Vascular Risk Factors, including stroke and diabetes, rather than hypertension and CHD are independent risk factors of MCI. Involvement in physical activities seems to reduce the risk of MCI."
"25957568","Subclinical atherosclerosis and subsequent cognitive function.","OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between measures of subclinical atherosclerosis and subsequent cognitive function.METHOD: Participants from the Dallas Heart Study (DHS), a population-based multiethnic study of cardiovascular disease pathogenesis, were re-examined 8 years later (DHS-2) with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); N = 1904, mean age = 42.9, range 8-65. Associations of baseline measures of subclinical atherosclerosis (coronary artery calcium, abdominal aortic plaque, and abdominal aortic wall thickness) with MoCA scores measured at follow-up were examined in the group as a whole and in relation to age and ApoE4 status.RESULTS: A significant linear trend of successively lower MoCA scores with increasing numbers of atherosclerotic indicators was observed (F(3, 1150) = 5.918, p = .001). CAC was weakly correlated with MoCA scores (p = .047) and MoCA scores were significantly different between participants with and without CAC (M = 22.35 vs 23.69, p = 0.038). With the exception of a small association between abdominal AWT and MoCA in subjects over age 50, abdominal AWT and abdominal aortic plaque did not correlate with MoCA total score (p = .052). Cognitive scores and atherosclerosis measures were not impacted by ApoE4 status (p = .455).CONCLUSION: In this ethnically diverse population-based sample, subclinical atherosclerosis was minimally associated with later cognitive function in middle-aged adults."
"25944337","Scaling Cognitive Domains of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment: An Analysis Using the Partial Credit Model.","The psychometric properties of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were examined by using the Partial Credit Model. The study sample included 897 participants who were distributed into two main subgroups: (I) the clinical group (90 patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment, 90 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 33 patients with Frontotemporal Dementia, and 34 patients with Vascular dementia, whose diagnoses were previously established according to a consensus that was reached by a multidisciplinary team, based on the international criteria) and (II) the healthy group (composed of 650 cognitively healthy community dwellers). The results show (i) an overall good fit for both the items and the persons' values, (ii) high variability for the cognitive performance level of the cognitive domains (ranging between 1.90 and -3.35, where &quot;Short-term Memory&quot; was the most difficult item and &quot;Spatial Orientation&quot; was the easiest item) and between the subjects on the scale, (iii) high reliability for the estimation of the persons' values, (iv) good discriminant validity and high diagnostic utility, and (v) a minimal differential item functioning effect related to of pathology, gender, age, and educational level. MoCA and its cognitive domains are suitable measures to use for screening the cognitive status of cognitively healthy subjects and patients with cognitive impairment. "

Shunted patients were excluded. Cerebral perfusion was measured by magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) in 46 patients with &gt;65% ICA (31 males, 64.5 ± 6.7 years) 1 week before and 6 weeks after CEA. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) 1 week before and 6 weeks after CEA.RESULTS: After CEA, perfusion parameters from PWI decreased, including mean transit time (MTT) (21.07 ± 7.36 vs. 14.27 ± 6.22, p &lt; .0001), time to peak (TTP) (28.69 ± 8.54 vs. 23.45 ± 4.25, p = .001), arrive time (T0) (19.89 ± 7.32 vs. 15.20 ± 3.51, p = .001), and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) (11.48 ± 3.50 vs. 7.53 ± 3.17, p &lt; .0001). A significant improvement was observed in MoCA (20.48 ± 1.70 vs. 22.04 ± 1.48, p = .001). Spearman's rank correlation analysis between TTP and MoCA scores demonstrated a linear relationship with an excellent correlation coefficient (R = -.893, p &lt; .001). Linear regression indicated that diabetes was a risk factor for cognitive improvement in patients with ICA (p = .014). Further analysis showed that patients with DM performed worse in MoCA after the procedure (with-DM 21.15 ± 1.28 vs. non-DM 22.4 ± 1.46, p = .010) while the baselines were similar (non-DM: 20.3 ± 1.8 vs. with-DM: 20.9 ± 1.4, p = .362).CONCLUSION: CEA could improve the cerebral perfusion and the cognitive function in un-shunted ICA patients. Cerebral reperfusion was an important factor for cognitive improvement. Diabetes had a negative effect on cognitive improvement after CEA."
"25903433","A study on cognitive impairment and gray matter volume abnormalities in silent cerebral infarction patients.","INTRODUCTION: The relationship between silent cerebral infarction (SCI) and the integrity of cognitive function is unknown. We intended to investigate whether cognitive impairment is associated with gray matter volume (GMV) in the SCI patients.METHODS: Sixty-two patients with SCI and 62 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC) were evaluated with P300 test, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test, Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and Hamilton Depression Scale (HDRS). Whole brain high-resolution T1-weighted images were processed with SPM12b software and analyzed by voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Correlation analysis was performed between the GMV and the scores of MoCA Scale, P300 latency, P300 amplitude, HAMA, HDRS, age, and educational level.RESULTS: The brains of the SCI patients have a significant reduction in GMV in the left superior and inferior frontal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, and bilateral hippocampus gyrus (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01, FDR correction). No significant increase of GMV was detected. The GMV of their frontal and temporal lobes is positively correlated with the score of MoCA scale and P300 amplitude (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.62, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01). The GMV of frontal, temporal, and hippocampus is negatively correlated with P300 latency (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.71, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). No significant correlation between the GMV of abnormal brain regions and another two clinical characteristics was found.CONCLUSION: SCI patients have impaired cognitive function and reduced GMV compared to the HC subjects. The neuropathological basis of such cognitive deficits in SCI patients might be a reduced GMV."
"25879880","Cognitive impairment six months after ischaemic stroke: a profile from the ASPIRE-S study.","BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment commonly occurs in the acute phase post-stroke, but may persist with over half of all stroke survivors experiencing some form of long-term cognitive deficit. Recent evidence suggests that optimising secondary prevention adherence is a critical factor in preventing recurrent stroke and the incidence of stroke-related cognitive impairment and dementia. The aim of this study was to profile cognitive impairment of stroke survivors at six months, and to identify factors associated with cognitive impairment post-stroke, focusing on indicators of adequate secondary prevention and psychological function.METHODS: Participants were assessed at six months following an ischaemic stroke as part of the Action on Secondary Prevention Interventions and Rehabilitation in Stroke study (ASPIRE-S), which examined the secondary preventive and rehabilitative profile of patients in the community post-stroke. Cognitive impairment was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).RESULTS: Two-hundred and fifty-six stroke patients were assessed at six months. Over half of the sample (56.6%) were found to have cognitive impairment, with significant associations between cognitive impairment and female sex (odds ratio (OR)<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.6, 95% CI 1.01-2.57) and history of cerebrovascular disease (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.22, 95% CI 1.38-3.59). Treatment with antihypertensive medications (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>.65, 95% CI .44-.96) and prescription of anticoagulant therapy (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>.41, 95% CI .26-.68) were associated with reduced likelihood of cognitive impairment, however increasing number of total prescribed medications was moderately associated with poorer cognitive impairment (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.12, 95% CI 1.04-1.19).CONCLUSIONS: Findings reveal levels of cognitive impairment at 6 months post-stroke that are concerning. Encouragingly, aspects of secondary prevention were identified that may be protective in reducing the incidence of cognitive impairment post-stroke. Neuropsychological rehabilitation post-stroke is also required as part of stroke rehabilitation models to meet the burden of post-stroke cognitive impairment."
"25874998","Prevalence of post-stroke cognitive impairment in china: a community-based, cross-sectional study.","International hospital-based studies have indicated a high risk of cognitive impairment after stroke, evidence from community-based studies in China is scarce. To determine the prevalence of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) and its subtypes in stroke survivors residing in selected rural and urban Chinese communities, we conducted a community-based, cross-sectional study in 599 patients accounting for 48% of all stroke survivors registered in the 4 communities, who had suffered confirmed strokes and had undergone cognitive assessments via the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Hachinski Ischemia Scale (HIS). Detection of PSCI was based on scores in these neuropsychological scales. Factors potentially impacting on occurrence of PSCI were explored by comparing demographic characteristics, stroke features, and cardiovascular risk factors between patients with and without PSCI. The overall prevalence of PSCI was 80.97% (95%CI: 77.82%-84.11%), while that of non-dementia PSCI (PSCI-ND) and post-stroke vascular dementia (PSD) was 48.91% (95%CI: 44.91%-52.92%) and 32.05% (95%CI: 28.32%-35.79%), respectively. Prior stroke and complications during the acute phase were independent risk factors for PSCI. The risk of recurrent stroke survivors having PSCI was 2.7 times higher than for first-episode survivors, and it was 3 times higher for those with complications during the acute phase than for those without. The higher prevalence of PSCI in this study compared with previous Chinese studies was possibly due to the combined effects of including rural stroke survivors, a longer period from stroke onset, and different assessment methods. There is an urgent need to recognize and prevent PSCI in stroke patients, especially those with recurrent stroke and complications during the acute phase. "
"25859933","Microstructural White Matter Abnormalities and Cognitive Dysfunction in Subcortical Ischemic Vascular Disease: an Atlas-Based Diffusion Tensor Analysis Study.","Recent studies in subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) suggest the involvement of white matter (WM) abnormalities underlying the pathogenesis of cognitive function impairment. Here, we performed magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) on detecting WM damage and to investigate the correlations between DTI measures and cognitive dysfunction in SIVD patients. Fifty right-handed SIVD patients were recruited and divided into vascular cognitive impairment on dementia (VCIND) group and normal cognition (NC) group. Twenty-two VCIND patients and 28 NC patients underwent DTI scanning and neuropsychological assessment. Atlas-based analysis (ABA) was performed on each subject for extracting FA and MD measures from supratentorial tracts. Among VCIND, as compared to NC patients, decreased FA and increased MD were observed in all projection fibers (bilateral anterior, posterior limb, and retrolenticular part of internal capsule, anterior, superior, and posterior corona radiata and posterior thalamic radiation), association fibers (bilateral sagittal stratum, external capsule, cingulum, fornix, and stria terminalis, superior longitudinal fasciculus, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus), and commissural fibers (genu, body, splenium, and bilateral tapetum of corpus callosum). Furthermore, we also found that MoCA scores correlated with DTI values in all supratentorial WM tracts. The results suggested that SIVD patients demonstrated abnormal WM connectivity in all supratentorial regions. Moreover, the severity of damage in WM tracts correlated with cognitive dysfunction. "
"25858350","The Brief Memory and Executive Test (BMET) for detecting vascular cognitive impairment in small vessel disease: a validation study.","BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is common in patients with cerebral small vessel disease, but is not well detected using common cognitive screening tests which have been primarily devised for cortical dementias. We developed the Brief Memory and Executive Test (BMET); a rapid screening measure sensitive to the impaired executive function and processing speed characteristic of small vessel disease (SVD). To assess the BMET's validity for general use, we evaluated it when administered by non-psychologists in a multicentre study and collected control data to derive normative scores.METHODS: Two-hundred participants with SVD, defined as a clinical lacunar stroke and a corresponding lacunar infarct on MRI, and 303 healthy controls aged between 40-90 years old were recruited. The BMET, as well as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), were performed. Overall, 55 SVD participants underwent repeat testing at 3 months to assess the BMET test-retest reliability.RESULTS: Administering the BMET took a mean (SD) of 12.9 (4.7) in cases and 9.5 (2.6) minutes in controls. Receiver Operator Curve analysis showed the BMET was a good predictor of cognitive impairment in SVD (AUC<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.94) and performed significantly better than both the MoCA (AUC<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.77) and the MMSE (AUC<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.70). Using a cut-off score of 13, the BMET had a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 76% for detecting cognitive impairment in SVD.CONCLUSIONS: The BMET is a brief and sensitive tool for the detection of cognitive impairment in patients with SVD."
"25817619","Can the Montreal Cognitive Assessment predict discharge destination in a stroke population in the hospital?","BACKGROUND: To decide on an appropriate discharge destination for stroke survivors from hospital, factors such as activities of daily living and age are often taken into account as predictors. Cognition has been found to support the decision whether to send a patient home or to a dependent living situation. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) has been proven to be a suitable cognitive screening instrument in the acute phase after stroke. However, its predictive value in the determination of discharge destination is unknown. The aim of the present study was to examine whether cognitive functioning, as measured with the MOCA, in the acute phase after stroke could predict discharge destination.METHODS: The study involved 211 patients with a first-ever cerebral stroke within the first week after stroke. Demographic and stroke-specific data, cognitive functioning (MOCA), and level of functional disability (Barthel Index [BI]) were collected. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to predict discharge destination (dependent versus independent living situation).RESULTS: Both age (B = -.05; P &lt; .01) and BI score (B = .33; P &lt; .001) were found to be significantly related to discharge destination with explained variance of 43%. Adding MOCA score as a predictor variable to the model resulted in a nonsignificant improvement of the model, explaining 44% of the variance.CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive functioning, as measured by a single screening instrument such as the MOCA, in the acute phase after stroke is not predictive for discharge destination."
"25770310","Impact of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on post-stroke dysmnesia and the role of BDNF Val66Met SNP.","BACKGROUND: Little is known about the effects of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on dysmnesia and the impact of brain nucleotide neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). This study investigated the impact of low-frequency rTMS on post-stroke dysmnesia and the impact of BDNF Val66Met SNP.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty patients with post-stroke dysmnesia were prospectively randomized into the rTMS and sham groups. BDNF Val66Met SNP was determined using restriction fragment length polymorphism. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Loewenstein Occupational Therapy of Cognitive Assessment (LOTCA), and Rivermead Behavior Memory Test (RBMT) scores, as well as plasma BDNF concentrations, were measured at baseline and at 3 days and 2 months post-treatment.RESULTS: MoCA, LOTCA, and RBMT scores were higher after rTMS. Three days after treatment, BDNF decreased in the rTMS group but it increased in the sham group (P&lt;0.05). Two months after treatment, RMBT scores in the rTMS group were higher than in the sham group, but not MoCA and LOTCA scores.CONCLUSIONS: Low-frequency rTMS may improve after-stoke memory through various pathways, which may involve polymorphisms and several neural genes, but not through an increase in BDNF levels."
"25766087","The Cognitive Assessment scale for Stroke Patients (CASP) vs. MMSE and MoCA in non-aphasic hemispheric stroke patients.","INTRODUCTION: CASP specifically assesses post-stroke cognitive impairments. Its items are visual and as such can be administered to patients with severe expressive aphasia. We have previously shown that the CASP was more suitable than the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in aphasic patients. Our objective was to compare the above scales in non-aphasic stroke patients, and assess to what extent the solely visual items of the CASP were problematic in cases of neurovisual impairments.METHODS: Fifty non-aphasic patients admitted to Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&amp;R) units after a recent left- or right-hemisphere stroke were evaluated with the CASP, MMSE and MoCA. We compared these three scales in terms of feasibility, concordance, and influence of neurovisual impairments on the total score.RESULTS: Twenty-nine men and 21 women were included (mean age 63 ± 14). For three patients, the MoCa was impossible to administer. It took significantly less time to administer the CASP (10 ± 5 min) than the MoCA (11 ± 5 min, P=0.02), yet it still took more time than MMSE administration (7 ± 3 min, P&lt;10(-6)). Neurovisual impairments affected equally the total scores of the three tests. Concordance between these scores was poor and only the CASP could specifically assess unilateral spatial neglect.CONCLUSION: The sole visual format of the CASP scale seems suitable for administration in post-stroke patients."
"25724660","Cognitive performance in community-dwelling older adults with stroke and the contribution of age and diffuse subcortical damage: a population-based study in rural Ecuador (The Atahualpa Project).","BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is common among stroke survivors. However, there is controversy on the role of the stroke itself or the associated subcortical damage in post-stroke cognitive decline.AIM: To assess the independent contribution and the interaction of age, the stroke itself and diffuse subcortical damage in the poor cognitive performance observed in patients with stroke.METHODS: Atahualpa residents aged =60 years were identified during a door-to-door survey and invited to undergo brain MRI for identification of stroke lesions and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) of presumed vascular origin. Cognitive performance was evaluated by the use of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Using a generalized linear model, we examined the association between MoCA score, stroke and WMH, after adjusting for demographics, education, vascular risk factors, depression and edentulism.RESULTS: Out of 311 persons aged =60 years, 242 (78 %) were enrolled. MRI showed strokes in 39 (16 %) and moderate-to-severe WMH in 52 (22 %) cases. Mean MoCA score was 18.5 ± 4.7 in the entire population. When participants were stratified according to the median age of the population (67 years), the generalized linear model showed that MoCA scores were not different in younger persons irrespective of the presence of stroke or WMH. In contrast, increased age associated with lower MoCA scores in persons with WMH (p = 0.002) or with both stroke and WMH (p = 0.003), but not in those with stroke without WMH (p = 0.087).CONCLUSIONS: Interaction of age and diffuse subcortical damage are major determinants for poor cognitive performance among stroke patients."

We investigated the validity, reliability, and feasibility of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 5-minute protocol (MoCA 5-minute protocol) administered over the telephone.METHODS: Four items examining attention, verbal learning and memory, executive functions/language, and orientation were extracted from the MoCA to form the MoCA 5-minute protocol. One hundred four patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack, including 53 with normal cognition (Clinical Dementia Rating, 0) and 51 with cognitive impairment (Clinical Dementia Rating, 0.5 or 1), were administered the MoCA in clinic and a month later, the MoCA 5-minute protocol over the telephone.RESULTS: Administration of the MoCA 5-minute protocol took 5 minutes over the telephone. Total score of the MoCA 5-minute protocol correlated negatively with age (r=-0.36; P&lt;0.001) and positively with years of education (r=0.41; P&lt;0.001) but not with sex (<U+03C1>=0.03; P=0.773). Total scores of the MoCA and MoCA 5-minute protocol were highly correlated (r=0.87; P&lt;0.001). The MoCA 5-minute protocol performed equally well as the MoCA in differentiating patients with cognitive impairment from those without (areas under receiver operating characteristics curve for MoCA 5-minute protocol, 0.78; MoCA=0.74; P&gt;0.05 for difference; Cohen d for group difference, 0.80-1.13). It differentiated cognitively impaired patients with executive domain impairment from those without (areas under receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.89; P&lt;0.001; Cohen d=1.7 for group difference). Thirty-day test-retest reliability was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.89).CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA 5-minute protocol is a free, valid, and reliable cognitive screen for stroke and transient ischemic attack. It is brief and highly feasible for telephone administration."

In the acupuncture group, acupuncture was applied to Baihui (GV 20), Shuigou (GV 26), Fengfu (GV 16), Fengchi (GB 20) and the others, once a day, 6 times a week. The treatment of 4 weeks made one session and totally 2 sessions were required. In the medication group, nimodipine 30 mg, three times a day and fluoxetine 20 mg, once a day were prescribed for oral administration, for 8 weeks totally. Before treatment, at the end of the 4th week and at the end of the 8th week of treatment, cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and solubility CD40 ligand (sCD40L) were determined respectively. The scores in Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and Hamilton' s depression scale (HAMD) were evaluated in the two groups. The efficacies on cognitive function and depression symptoms were compared in the patients between the two groups. Results Compared with the outcome before treatment, mean blood flow velocity (Vm) of middle cerebral artery (MCA), anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) was increased significantly at the end of the 4th week of treatment in the two groups (all P&lt;0.05). At the end of the 8th week, Vm was increased much significantly (all P&lt;0.01). The differences were not significant in comparison between the two groups (all P&gt;0.05). Compared with the expression before treatment, sCD40L was reduced significantly after treatment in the patients of the two groups (all P&lt;0.01), but the differ- ence was not significant between the two groups (all P&gt;0.05). Compared with that before treatment, MoCA score was increased significantly after treatment in the two groups (all P&lt;0.01), HAMD score was reduced sig- nificantly (all P&lt;0.01), the differences were not significant in comparison between the two groups (all P&gt;0.05). The total effective rate of cognitive improvement was 86.7% (26/30) in the acupuncture group and was 80.0% (24/30) in the medication group, the differences were not significant in comparison of the two groups (P&gt;0.05). The total effective rate of the improvement in depression was 93.3% (21/30) in the acupuncture group and was 86.7% (26/30) in the medication group, the differences were not significant in comparison of the two groups (P&gt;0.05).CONCLUSION: Acupuncture could significantly increases CBFV and reduces serum sCD40L expressions in the patients of SIVD complicated with depression, and significantly improves cognitive function and relieves depression symptoms. The efficacy of it is similar to that of western medication. The increase of serum sCD40L expression is possibly involved in the occurrence and development of SIVD. Reducing sCD40L expression contributes to the alleviation of damage induced by cerebral ischemia and reperfusion."
"25639837","Depression, anxiety, and cognitive functioning after intracerebral hemorrhage.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Post-stroke depression (PSD) is an important complication of stroke. We studied long-term PSD after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) at young age, as well as anxiety, and cognitive functioning of the survivors.METHODS: We gathered clinical and imaging data of 336 young ICH patients between age 16 and 49 treated in the Helsinki University Central Hospital. After a median follow-up of 9.7 (7.0-12.0) years, we interviewed 130 survivors with structural questionnaires including Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale (PASS), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with PSD (BDI-II score &gt;13). Degree of disability was measured by modified Rankin Scale score (mRS).RESULTS: PSD was present among 30 (23.1%) and anxiety among 52 (40.0%) patients (HADS score &gt;6). Higher degree of disability was associated with symptoms of depression (higher BDI-II scores, P = 0.001), emotional distress (higher HADS scores, P = 0.004), and pain (higher PASS scores, P = 0.008, and higher BPI scores, P = 0.003). The only baseline factor identified to associate with PSD was hydrocephalus (P = 0.014). Median PASS score was 9 (IQR 0-25), median BPI score was 5 (0-23), and median MoCA score was 26 (22-28) hinting to normal or mild cognitive dysfunction. Antidepressants were used by 9.2%.CONCLUSIONS: One of four survivors of ICH at young age suffers long-term PSD. Higher degree of disability predicted occurrence of PSD. Treatment of depression appears as an unmet need in young ICH survivors."

Tools with sensitivity = 80% and specificity = 60% were selected. Clinical utility was assessed using a previously validated tool and those scoring &lt;6 were excluded.DATA SYNTHESIS: Twenty-one papers regarding 12 screening tools were selected. Only the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) met all psychometric and clinical utility criteria for any levels of cognitive impairment. However, the MMSE is most accurate to screen for dementia (cut-off score 23/24) and should only be used for this purpose. In addition, the following can be used to detect:  Any impairment: Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R), Barrow Neurological Institute Screen for Higher Cerebral Functions (BNIS) and Cognistat.  Multiple-domain impairments: ACE-R, Telephone-MoCA or modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS).  Dementia: TICS; Cambridge Cognitive Examination; Rotterdam-Cambridge Cognitive Examination; Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) and short-IQCODE. The IQCODE and short-IQCODE are useful when the patient is unable to respond and an informant's view is required.CONCLUSION: The MoCA is the most valid and clinically feasible screening tool to identify stroke survivors with a wide range of cognitive impairments who warrant further assessment."

In this study, we aim to investigate whether a physical exercise programme (MoveIT) can prevent cognitive decline in patients in the acute phase after a TIA or minor ischaemic stroke.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A single-blinded randomised controlled trial will be conducted to investigate the effect of an aerobic exercise programme on cognition compared with usual care. 120 adult patients with a TIA or minor ischaemic stroke less than 1 month ago will be randomly allocated to an exercise programme consisting of a 12-week aerobic exercise programme and regular follow-up visits to a specialised physiotherapist during the period of 1 year or to usual care. Outcome measures will be assessed at the baseline, and at the 1-year and 2-year follow-up. The primary outcome is cognitive functioning measured with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test and with additional neuropsychological tests. Secondary outcomes include maximal exercise capacity, self-reported physical activity and measures of secondary prevention.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study received ethical approval from the VU University Amsterdam Ethics committee (2011/383). The results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international conferences. We will also disseminate the main results to our participants in a letter.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The Nederlands Trial Register NTR3884."

All patients had a single depressive episode of mild severity. Diagnosis of affective and cognitive impairment was carried out using clinical and neuropsychological methods (the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the night sleep questionnaire developed by A.M. Vein, the Mini-mental state examination (MMSE), the modified Mini-Cog method, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA), the Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI-S, CGI-I) to assess the degree and dynamics of the disease, the Patient Global Impression (PGI) scale. The survey had been performed after 2,4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Agomelatine (valdoxan) was used 1 time per day in the evening in a dose of 25 mg (1 tablet).RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Agomelatine improved sleep from the second week of treatment, reduced anxiety symptoms after six weeks and depressive symptoms after eight weeks. The improvement of cognitive functions was noted as well. No side-effects was observed. The results revealed the high antidepressive activity of the drug in treatment of mild depressive states in patients with chronic brain ischemia, the balanced spectrum of effects on anxiety, depression, insomnia, the positive effect on cognitive functions that allows to recommend agomelatine in treatment of patients with CBI."
"27981883","Varicose vein therapy and nerve lesions.","Treating varicose veins using endovenous thermal techniques - especially laser and radio frequency ablation - has emerged as an effective alternative to open surgery with stripping and high ligation. Even though these methods are very gentle and patient-friendly, they are nevertheless accompanied by risks and side effects. Compared to open surgical therapy, the risk of damage to peripheral and motor nerves is reduced; however, it still exists as a result of heat exposure and tumescent anaesthesia. Non-thermal methods that can be applied without tumescent anaesthesia have been introduced to the market. They pose a considerably lower risk of nerve lesions while proving to be much more effective. This paper investigates data on postoperative nerve damage and paraesthesia using internet research (PubMed). It analyses the current state of knowledge regarding non-thermal treatment methods and takes into account the latest developments in the use of cyanoacrylate to close insufficient saphenous veins."
"27936074","Association between Metabolic Syndrome and Cognitive Impairment after Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Cross-Sectional Study in a Chinese Population.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Metabolic syndrome (MetS), a risk factor for many vascular conditions, is associated with vascular cognitive disorders. The objective of the present study was to explore the associations of MetS and its individual components with the risks of cognitive impairment and neurological dysfunction in patients after acute stroke.METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 840 patients ranging in age from 53 to 89 years from the Tianjin area of North China. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination. Neuropsychiatric behavior was assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire. Emotional state was examined according to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and neuromotor function was evaluated using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Barthel index, and the Activity of Daily Living test. After overnight fasting, blood samples were obtained to measure biochemistry indicators.RESULTS: MetS and its individual components were closely correlated with MoCA score. MetS patients had high levels of inflammation and a 3.542-fold increased odds ratio (OR) for cognitive impairment [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.972-6.361]. Of the individual MetS components, central obesity (OR 3.039; 95% CI: 1.839-5.023), high fasting plasma glucose (OR 1.915; 95% CI: 1.016-3.607), and type 2 diabetes (OR 2.241; 95% CI: 1.630-3.081) were associated with an increased incidence of cognitive impairment. Consistent and significant worsening in different neurological domains was observed with greater numbers of MetS components.CONCLUSIONS: MetS was associated with worse cognitive function, neuromotor dysfunction, and neuropsychological symptoms among Chinese acute stroke patients."

Patients who had stroke as the qualifying event with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale indicating aphasia or neglect were excluded from these analyses. Patients with a cerebrovascular event (ischemic stroke, cerebral infarct with temporary signs or intracranial hemorrhage) during follow-up were excluded from follow-up visit analyses. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score was used to assess cognition impairment at baseline, 4 months, 12 months and closeout. Cognitive impairment was defined as MoCA &lt;26. Mean MoCA scores and the percentage of patients with cognitive impairment were compared between treatment groups at each time point using t tests and chi-square tests. Differences in MoCA mean at baseline and follow-up time points were compared using mixed model repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer tests.RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for mean MoCA at any time point. Mean MoCA scores improved in both groups. The percentage of patients with cognitive impairment in the AMM versus PTAS groups was not significantly different at any time point.CONCLUSIONS: Revascularization with PTAS showed no improvement in cognitive impairment over AMM alone among patients who did not have recurrent cerebrovascular events during follow-up."
"27804110","Cognitive function in stroke survivors: A 10-year follow-up study.","OBJECTIVES: Post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) has considerable impact on patients and society. However, long-term studies on PSCI are scarce and may be influenced by assessment methods and selection bias. We aimed to (i) assess the prevalence of long-term PSCI; (ii) compare two common cognitive assessment instruments; and (iii) compare cognitive function of long-term stroke survivors with non-stroke persons.METHODS: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were administered to 10-year survivors from a population-based cohort of first-ever stroke patients included in the Lund Stroke Register, Sweden, in 2001-2002. PSCI was defined as MMSE&lt;27 and/or MoCA&lt;25 and severe cognitive impairment as MMSE&lt;23. Age- and sex-matched non-stroke control subjects who had performed MMSE (but not MoCA) were recruited from the longitudinal population study &quot;Good Ageing in Skåne.&quot; The odds of having cognitive impairment for stroke survivors compared to controls were examined with logistic regression analyses adjusting for education.RESULTS: Of 145 stroke survivors after 10 years, 127 participated. MMSE showed PSCI in 46%, whereas MoCA displayed PSCI in 61%. Among the stroke survivors with MoCA&lt;25, 35% had MMSE=27 (P&lt;.001). The odds of having severe cognitive impairment defined as MMSE&lt;23 were higher among the stroke survivors compared to 354 controls (education-adjusted; OR=2.5; P=.004).CONCLUSIONS: Post-stroke cognitive impairment was prevalent among 10-year stroke survivors, and the odds of having severe cognitive impairment were higher among the stroke survivors compared to non-stroke persons. The burden of long-term PSCI might have been underestimated previously, and MoCA may be more suitable than MMSE to detect long-term PSCI."
"27798938","Cognitive Impairment in Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease: The Canadian Frailty Observation and Interventions Trial.","BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than one third of older adults, and is a strong risk factor for vascular disease and cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment can have detrimental effects on the quality of life through decreased treatment adherence and poor nutrition and results in increased costs of care and early mortality. Though widely studied in hemodialysis populations, little is known about cognitive impairment in patients with pre-dialysis CKD.METHODS: Multicenter, cross-sectional, prospective cohort study including 385 patients with CKD stages G4-G5. Cognitive function was measured with a validated tool called the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as part of a comprehensive frailty assessment in the Canadian Frailty Observation and Interventions Trial. Cognitive impairment was defined as a MoCA score of =24. We determined the prevalence and risk factors for cognitive impairment in patients with CKD stages G4-G5, not on dialysis.RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty seven participants (61%) with CKD stages G4-G5 had cognitive impairment at baseline assessment. When compared to a control group, this population scored lower in all domains of cognition, with the most pronounced deficits observed in recall, attention, and visual/executive function (p &lt; 0.01 for all comparisons). Older age, recent history of falls and history of stroke were independently associated with cognitive impairment.CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered a high rate of unrecognized cognitive impairment in an advanced CKD population. This impairment is global, affecting all aspects of cognition and is likely vascular in nature. The longitudinal trajectory of cognitive function and its effect on dialysis decision-making and outcomes deserves further study."

The cognitive functions of two groups were evaluated by designated specialists using MoCA (Beijing version) and MMSE (Chinese version).RESULTS: Comparedwith the patientswith stroke, the patientswith TBI received significantly lower score in orientation subtest and recall subtest in both tests.MoCA abnormal rates in the TBI group and stroke group were 94.17% and 86.61% respectively,whileMMSE abnormal rateswere 69.90% and 57.48%, respectively. In the TBI group, 87.10% patientswith normalMMSE score had abnormalMoCA score and in the stroke group, about 70.37% patients with normal MMSE score had abnormal MoCA score. The diagnostic consistency of two scales in the TBI group and the stroke group were 72% and 69%, respectively.CONCLUSION: In our rehabilitation center, patients with TBI may have more extensive and severe cognitive impairments than patients with stroke, prominently in orientation and recall domain. In screening post- TBI cognitive impairment, MoCA tends to be more sensitive than MMSE."

Thirty patients with dysphagia after stroke were enrolled in our study. To evaluate the ICF dysphagia scale, 6 scales were used as comparisons, namely the Barthel Index (BI), Repetitive Saliva Swallowing Test (RSST), Kubota Water Swallowing Test (KWST), Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Multiple regression analysis was performed to quantitate the relationship between the ICF scale and the other 7 scales. In addition, 60 ICF scales were analyzed by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. A total of 21 ICF codes were identified, which were closely related with the other scales. These included 13 codes from Body Function, 1 from Body Structure, 3 from Activities and Participation, and 4 from Environmental Factors. A topographic network map with 30 ICF key codes was also generated to visualize their relationships. The number of ICF codes identified is in line with other well-established evaluation methods. The network topographic map generated here could be used as an instruction tool in future evaluations. We also found that attention functions and biting were critical codes of these scales, and could be used as treatment targets. "
"27634030","Does Coronary Angiography and Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Affect Cognitive Function?","Cerebral microemboli are frequently observed during coronary angiography (CA) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and their numbers have been related to the vascular access site used. Although cerebral microemboli can cause silent cerebral lesions, their clinical impact is debated. To study this, 93 patients referred for CA or PCI underwent serial cognitive testing using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test to detect postprocedural cognitive impairment. Patients were randomized to radial or femoral access. In a subgroup of 35 patients, the number of cerebral microemboli was monitored with transcranial Doppler technique. We found the median precatheterization result of the MoCA test to be 27, and it did not change significantly 4 and 31 days, respectively, after the procedure. There was no significant correlation between the number of cerebral microemboli and the difference between preprocedural and postprocedural MoCA tests. The test results did not differ between vascular access sites. One-third of the patients had a precatheterization median MoCA test result &lt;26 corresponding to mild cognitive impairment. In conclusion, using the MoCA test, we could not detect any cognitive impairment after CA or PCI, and no significant correlations were found between the results of the MoCA test and cerebral microemboli or vascular access site, respectively. In patients with suspected coronary heart disease, mild cognitive impairment was common."

The study was performed at two trial sites. We studied 136 outpatients with cognitive decline. MRI was performed using a magnetic field of 1.5 and 3 T. Neuropsychological assessment included Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale (MoCA), Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-R), Cambridge Cognitive Examination battery (CAMCOG) (Part 3), Clock Drawing Test, fluency test and the visual memory test (SCT). CSF was examined for standard parameters such as tau, phosphorylated tau, amyloid-ß 1-40 and 42 and Qalbumin, in accordance with established protocols and genotype. In 61 patients (45 %), at least 1 CMB was found. Most of the CMBs were described in the amnestic profile (67 %). In 86 % of the cases, multiple CMB were observed. The ratio of Aß1-40/42 in non-amnestic patients with CMB was significantly lower (mean 0.6) than in patients without CMB (mean 1.2). A notable difference in the albumin ratio as an indicator of the BBB was observed between groups with and without CMB. In the CMP-positive group, the E2 genotype was observed more frequently, and the E4 genotype less frequently, than in the CMB-negative group. Based on the cerebrospinal fluid-serum albumin ratio, we were able to show that patients with CMB present several features of BBB dysfunction. According to logistic regression, the predictive factors for CMB in patients with cognitive decline were age, WMHs score and albumin ratio. We found a significant reduction in the Aß-amyloid ratio in the non-amnestic profile group with CMB (particularly in the cortical region) in comparison to those without CMB. While this is an interesting finding, its significance needs to be assessed in a prospective follow-up. "

Primary endpoints included Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) and Clinic Dementia Rating (CDR) scores, and secondary endpoints comprised Neuropsychiatric Inventory Caregiver Distress Scale (NPI-D), MMSE, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Activity of Daily Life (ADL) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores. Memantine treatment had no effect on overall NPI-Q scores, with the exception of the agitation subdomain in all patients with bvFTD. However, patients with moderate-to-severe bvFTD exhibited a better performance than patients with mild bvFTD, demonstrated by improved NPI-Q total scores and subscales of agitation, depression, apathy and disinhibition. In the moderate-to-severe group, CDR and HAMD scores remained stable, but MMSE, MoCA and ADL scores were reduced after 6 months of treatment. Memantine was well-tolerated in patients. In conclusion, patients with moderate-to-severe bvFTD responded significantly better to memantine in comparison to patients with mild bvFTD with regard to their neuropsychiatric scores, while memantine did not present any cognitive or functional benefits in patients with mild bvFTD. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with a larger number of patients is required to verify these promising results for patients with moderate-to-severe bvFTD."
"27318613","French consensus procedure for assessing cognitive function in Parkinson's disease.","INTRODUCTION: One of the objectives of the French expert centers for Parkinson's disease (NS-Park) network was to determine a consensus procedure for assessing cognitive function in patients with Parkinson's. This article presents this procedure and briefly describes the selected tests.METHODS: A group of 13 experts used the Delphi method for consensus building to define the overall structure and components of the assessment procedure. For inclusion in the battery, tests had to be validated in the French language, require little motor participation, have normative data and be recognized by the international community. Experimental tasks and tests requiring specific devices were excluded.RESULTS: Two possibilities were identified, depending on whether an abbreviated or comprehensive assessment of cognitive function was necessary. For an abbreviated assessment, the experts recommended the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as a screening test for cognitive impairment or dementia. For a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, the experts recommended assessing global efficiency plus the five main cognitive domains (attention and working memory, executive function, episodic memory, visuospatial function and language) that may be impaired in Parkinson's disease, using two tests for each domain.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: A common procedure for assessing cognitive function is now available across the French network dedicated to Parkinson's disease, and is recommended for both research and clinical practice. It will also help to promote standardization of the neuropsychological assessment of Parkinson's disease."
"27221810","A multi-centre randomised controlled trial comparing radiofrequency and mechanical occlusion chemically assisted ablation of varicose veins - Final results of the Venefit versus Clarivein for varicose veins trial.","Background Endovenous thermal ablation has revolutionised varicose vein treatment. New non-thermal techniques such as mechanical occlusion chemically assisted endovenous ablation (MOCA) allow treatment of entire trunks with single anaesthetic injections. Previous non-randomised work has shown reduced pain post-operatively with MOCA. This study presents a multi-centre randomised controlled trial assessing the difference in pain during truncal ablation using MOCA and radiofrequency endovenous ablation (RFA) with six months' follow-up. Methods Patients undergoing local anaesthetic endovenous ablation for primary varicose veins were randomised to either MOCA or RFA. Pain scores using Visual Analogue Scale and number scale (0-10) during truncal ablation were recorded. Adjunctive procedures were completed subsequently. Pain after phlebectomy was not assessed. Patients were reviewed at one and six months with clinical scores, quality of life scores and duplex ultrasound assessment of the treated leg. Results A total of 170 patients were recruited over a 21-month period from 240 screened. Patients in the MOCA group experienced significantly less maximum pain during the procedure by Visual Analogue Scale (MOCA median 15<U+2009>mm (interquartile range 7-36<U+2009>mm) versus RFA 34<U+2009>mm (interquartile range 16-53<U+2009>mm), p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.003) and number scale (MOCA median 3 (interquartile range 1-5) versus RFA 4<U+2009>mm (interquartile range 3-6.5), p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.002). ' Average' pain scores were also significantly less in the MOCA group; 74% underwent simultaneous phlebectomy. Occlusion rates, clinical severity scores, disease specific and generic quality of life scores were similar between groups at one and six months. There were two deep vein thromboses, one in each group. Conclusion Pain secondary to truncal ablation is less painful with MOCA than RFA with similar short-term technical, quality of life and safety outcomes."
"27174221","Comprehensive rehabilitation with integrative medicine for subacute stroke: A multicenter randomized controlled trial.","To determine whether integrative medicine rehabilitation (IMR) that combines conventional rehabilitation (CR) with acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine has better effects for subacute stroke than CR alone, we conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial that involved three hospitals in China. Three hundred sixty patients with subacute stroke were randomized into IMR and CR groups. The primary outcome was the Modified Barthel Index (MBI). The secondary outcomes were the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hamilton's Depression Scale (HAMD), and the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). All variables were evaluated at week 0 (baseline), week 4 (half-way of intervention), week 8 (after treatment) and week 20 (follow-up). In comparison with the CR group, the IMR group had significantly better improvements (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01 or P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05) in all the primary and secondary outcomes. There were also significantly better changes from baseline in theses outcomes in the IMR group than in the CR group (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01). A low incidence of adverse events with mild symptoms was observed in the IMR group. We conclude that conventional rehabilitation combined with integrative medicine is safe and more effective for subacute stroke rehabilitation."

"27067253","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment is superior to National Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network 5-minute protocol in predicting vascular cognitive impairment at 1 year.","BACKGROUND: The predictive ability of National Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network (NINDS-CSN) 5-minute protocol and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) administered sub-acutely and at the convalescent phase after stroke for significant vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) at 1 year is unknown. We compared prognostic values of these tests.METHODS: Patients with ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) received MoCA sub-acutely (within 2 weeks) and 3-6 months after stroke followed by a formal neuropsychological evaluation at 1 year. The total score of NINDS-CSN 5-minutes protocol was derived from MoCA. Moderate-severe VCI was defined as neuropsychological impairment in<U+2009>=<U+2009>3 domains. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analyses were conducted to establish the optimal cutoff points and discriminatory properties of the MoCA and NINDS-CSN 5-minute protocol in detecting moderate-severe VCI.RESULTS: Four hundre patients were recruited at baseline. Of these, 291 received a formal neuropsychological assessment 1 year after stroke. 19% patients had moderate-severe VCI. The MoCA was superior to the NINDS-CSN 5-minute protocol [sub-acute AUCs: 0.89 vs 0.80, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01; 3-6 months AUCs: 0.90 vs 0.83, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01] in predicting for moderate-severe VCI at 1 year. At respective cutoff points, MoCA had significantly higher sensitivity than the NINDS-CSN 5-minute protocol at baseline (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01) and 3-6 months (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.04).CONCLUSIONS: MoCA administered sub-acutely and 3-6 months after stroke is superior to the NINDS-CSN 5-minute protocol in predicting moderate-severe VCI at 1 year."
"27062418","The Impact of Falls on Motor and Cognitive Recovery after Discharge from In-Patient Stroke Rehabilitation.","BACKGROUND: Falls are common among community-dwelling stroke survivors. The aims of this study were (1) to compare motor and cognitive outcomes between individuals who fell in the 6 months' postdischarge from in-patient stroke rehabilitation and those who did not fall, and (2) to explore potential mechanisms underlying the relationship between falls and recovery of motor and cognitive function.METHODS: Secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of individuals discharged home from in-patient rehabilitation was conducted. Participants were recruited at discharge and completed a 6-month falls monitoring period using postcards with follow-up. Nonfallers and fallers were compared at the 6-month follow-up assessment on the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment (CMSA), gait speed, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Measures of balance confidence and physical activity were also assessed.RESULTS: Twenty-three fallers were matched to 23 nonfallers on age and functional balance scores at discharge. A total of 43 falls were reported during the study period (8 participants fell more than once). At follow-up, BBS scores (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.0066) and CMSA foot scores (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.0033) were significantly lower for fallers than for nonfallers. The 2 groups did not differ on CMSA leg scores (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.049), gait speed (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.47), or MoCA score (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.23). There was no significant association between change in balance confidence scores and change in physical activity levels among all participants from the first and third questionnaire (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>.27, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.08).CONCLUSIONS: Performance in balance and motor recovery of the foot were compromised in fallers when compared to nonfallers at 6 months post discharge from in-patient stroke rehabilitation."
"27048925","Associations between the Brief Memory and Executive Test (BMET), Activities of Daily Living, and Quality of Life in Patients with Cerebral Small Vessel Disease.","OBJECTIVES: In addition to neuropsychological difficulties, patients with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) can have reduced activities of daily living and a poorer quality of life compared to healthy adults. The Brief Memory and Executive Test (BMET), is a cognitive screening tool designed to be sensitive to the neuropsychological profile of patients with SVD. While the BMET is sensitive to the cognitive consequences of SVD, it is unclear how well scores on this measure relate to functional outcomes. The aims of this study are to investigate the relationship between scores on the BMET and functional outcomes (activities of daily living and quality of life) in SVD, and to compare this with other commonly used cognitive screening tools.METHODS: This study included 184 participants with SVD (mean age=63.2; SD=9.9) and 299 healthy controls (mean age=62.4; SD=13.8) who were tested using the BMET, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Stroke Specific - Quality of Life Scale (SS-QoL), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and measures of both instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and basic activities of daily living (BADL).RESULTS: After controlling for covariates the scores on the BMET, but not the MoCA or MMSE, were significantly related to poorer IADL and quality of life in the SVD group. In addition to the BMET scores, symptoms of depression were found to be significant associated with functional outcome.CONCLUSION: These results support the clinical utility of using of the BMET, in combination with a standardized depression questionnaire, during the early assessment of patients with SVD."

"26903584","Validating a Pragmatic Approach to Cognitive Screening in Stroke Prevention Clinics Using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is used commonly to identify cognitive impairment (CI), but there are multiple published cut points for normal and abnormal. We seek to validate a pragmatic approach to screening for moderate-severe CI, by classifying patients into high-, intermediate-, and low-risk categories.METHODS: A total of 390 participants attending an academic Stroke Prevention Clinic completed the MoCA and more detailed neuropsychological testing. Between April 23, 2012 and April 30, 2014, all consecutive new referrals to the regional Stroke Prevention Clinic who were English-speaking, not severely aphasic, and could see and write well enough to complete neuropsychological testing were assessed for inclusion, and consenting patients were enrolled. CI was defined as =2 SDs below normal for age and education on at least 2 cognitive subtests. A single cut point for CI was compared with 2 cut points (high sensitivity and high specificity) generated using receiver operator characteristic and area under the curve analyses. The intermediate-risk group contained those scoring between the 2 cut points.RESULTS: Thirty-four percent of participants had a symptomatic or silent stroke, 34% were seen for possible or probable transient ischemic attack, and 32% were diagnosed with other vascular or nonvascular conditions. Using a single cut point, sensitivity and specificity were optimal with MoCA =22, (sensitivity=60.4%, specificity=89.9%, area under the curve=0.801, positive predictive value=48.5%, negative predictive value=93.5%, positive likelihood ratio=6, and negative likelihood ratio=0.4). Using 2 cut points, sensitivity was optimal with MoCA =28 (sensitivity=96.2%, negative predictive value =97.6%, and negative likelihood ratio=1.27), and specificity was optimal with MoCA =22 (specificity=89.9%, positive predictive value=48.5%, and positive likelihood ratio=6).CONCLUSIONS: Stratifying participants into 3 categories facilitates the identification of a homogenous group at low risk for CI, as well as 2 other groups with intermediate and higher risk. This approach could facilitate clinical care pathways and patient selection for research."
"26886083","Brain Microvasculature Involvement in ANCA Positive Vasculitis.","OBJECTIVE: Endothelial dysfunction is associated with arterial stiffness, a factor that is increasingly recognised as an important determinant of cardiovascular risk. High-flow organs such as the brain and kidneys are particularly sensitive to excessive pressure and flow pulsatility. High, local blood flow is associated with low microvascular impedance, which facilitates the penetration of excessive pulsatile energy into the microvascular bed leading to tissue damage. Systemic endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness have been demonstrated in peripheral vessels in associated vasculitis (AAV). Although, the brain involvement is not infrequent in AAV, it has not been evaluated previously. Our aim is to evaluate the involvement of the brain microvasculature in AAV.METHODS: Twenty-three patients with inactive AAV were studied. Brain blood flow was assessed by transcranial Doppler (TCD) and single-photon positron emission tomography (SPECT), structural brain involvement by brain MRI and cognitive scores by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test.RESULTS: Lower mean flow velocity (MFV) was associated to altered SPECT perfusion, higher white matter changes (WMC), lower MoCA scores and younger age (p &lt; 0.05). Middle cerebral artery pulsatility index (MCA-PI) was related to hypertension, diabetes, lower scores on MoCA, increased vasculitis damage index (VDI) and perfusion impairment in SPECT (p &lt; 0.05). These data were reproduced for all intracranial arteries. Up to 88.9% of patients had WMC on MRI. A higher lesion load was associated with age, decreased MoCA and fewer MFV with higher PI. The multivariable linear regression analysis showed that the greater the lesion loads, greater the bifrontal atrophy, MCA-PI and lower MoCA scores. Up to 60.9% of patients presented a decreased MoCA score (p = 0.012). It appeared to be related to VDI (p = 0.04), WMC (p = 0.004) and altered SPECT (p = 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The alterations in brain perfusion SPECT, the presence of white matter lesions on MRI, as well as increased PI and RI with lower MFV of the cerebral vessels in TCD suggest the presence of microangiopathy in asymptomatic AAV that could lead to cognitive impairment."

While the MCI-no LI group had increased ReHo and ALFF in the bilateral hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, frontal lobe, and decreased ALFF and ReHo in the temporal lobe. Compared with the MCI-no LI patients, those with MCI-LI had decreased ALFF in the frontal lobe; decreased ReHo in the Pcu/CU and insula; and increased ALFF and ReHo in the temporal lobe (p<U+200A>&lt; <U+200A>0.05, AlphaSim corrected). In MCI-LI patients, the MOCA scores showed a relatively weak correlation with ALFF values in the medial frontal gyrus (r<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.432, p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.045) (of borderline significance after Bonferroni correction).CONCLUSIONS: The spontaneous brain activities in MCI-LI were distinct from MCI-no LI. The probable compensatory mechanism observed in MCI-no LI might be disrupted in MCI with LI due to vascular damage."

MiR-132 was detected using a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method. To test the predictive value of miR-132 for PSCI, prediction capabilities were compared using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under curve (AUC) analysis.RESULTS: The level of miR-132 in PSCI patient serum was significantly elevated compared to that of PSCN and AMC subjects. The ROC curve showed that miR-132 achieved an AUC of 0.961 (p&lt;0.0001). Importantly, the miR-132 level was correlated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score in PSCI patients.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that there was a substantial correlation between serum miR-132 expression and post-stroke cognitive functionality, suggesting that miR-132 may be a risk marker for PSCI. Because of the limitations of this study, the results should be treated with caution."

Based on the regulation of blood pressure and blood sugar and anticoagulation,cognitive rehabilitation training was adopted in the control group. On the basis of treatment in the control group,acupuncture was applied in the observation group. The acupoints were Baihui(GV 20), Sishencong (EX-HN 1), Shenting (GV 24), Yintang(GV 29), Hegu (LI 4) and Taichong(LR 3). Sishencong(EX-HN 1), Shenting (GV 24) and Yintang (GV 29) were connected to electroacupuncture apparatus. The treatment was given once a day,5 times a week, and 8-week treatment was acquired in the two groups. In the 4th week and the 8th week,limbs motor function, daily life ability and cognitive function were evaluated by Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) scale,Bathel index and MoCA scale.RESULTS: In 4 weeks and 8 weeks, the scores of FMA, Bathel index and MoCA in the two groups were improved compared with those before treatment (all P &lt; 0.05). After 8-week treatment, the scores of Bathel index and MoCA in the observation group were better than those in the control group (both P &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: Based on the cognitive rehabilitation training and the conventional treatment, acupuncture can improve the cognitive function and daily life ability of stroke patients at subacute stage with mild cognitive impairment."

We also demonstrated that the test was effective for screening for very mild vascular dementia (VaD) in the community. Herein, we examined the effectiveness of MoCA in the assessment of patients with VaD in an outpatient clinic. Forty-four patients with VaD (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences [NINDS-AIREN] criteria) and 58 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association [NINCDS-ADRDA] criteria) were compared with 67 non-demented control subjects. All were outpatients at the Tajiri Memory Clinic, Osaki-Tajiri, northern Japan. All underwent 1.5 Tesla MRI and ethyl cysteinate dimer (ECD) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) examinations. The SPECT images were used to classify the VaD patients into two subgroups, those with frontal hypoperfusion (F-VaD) and those without frontal hypoperfusion. The frontal hypoperfusion pattern was defined as the &quot;P2&quot; pattern of the Sliverman classification, with or without focal hypometabolism in other areas, based on the agreement of three neurologists who were blinded to the results of the neuropsychological examinations. Total scores and attention subscores on the MoCA were lower in the F-VaD group compared with other groups. Our results suggest that the MoCA attention subscale can detect VaD participants, particularly those with frontal hypoperfusion. "

Patients with first-time anterior circulation TIA (diagnosed within 24 h of onset) and normal cognition, treated between August 2009 and August 2014 at the Department of Neurology of Chengdu Military General Hospital, China, were analyzed retrospectively. Patients underwent whole-brain CTPI within 1 week of TIA to detect cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean transit time (MTT) and time to peak (TTP) in the ischemic region. Based on cognitive function assessment 4 weeks after TIA, using the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and mini mental state examination, the patients were divided into control and VCI groups. CTPI parameters and other clinical data were compared between groups, and Spearman's correlation analysis used to identify associations between cognitive scores and CTPI parameters in the VCI group. 50 patients (25 per group; aged 55-72 years) were included. Patient age, gender, smoking status, alcohol consumption, educational level, time from TIA onset to admission, time from TIA onset to CTPI, and prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation and hyperhomocysteinemia did not differ between groups. Both groups showed TTP and MTT prolongation, CBF reduction, but no change in CBV in the ischemic region; these changes were significantly larger in the VCI group (P &lt; 0.05). MTT correlated negatively with MoCA score (r = -0.51, P = 0.009). CTPI could facilitate early diagnosis of VCI in patients with anterior circulation TIA. "

A cohort of people with TIA was recruited within two weeks of symptom onset. All individuals completed a robotic-based assessment of 8 behavioural tasks related to upper limb motor and proprioceptive function, as well as cognitive function. Robotic task performance was compared to a large cohort of controls without neurological impairments corrected for the influence of age. Impairment in people with TIA was defined as performance below the 5th percentile of controls. Participants with TIA were also assessed with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment (CMSA) of the arm, the Behavioural Inattention Test (BIT), the Purdue pegboard test (PPB), and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Age-related white matter change (ARWMC), prior infarction and cella-media index (CMI) were assessed from baseline CT scan that was performed within 24 hours of TIA. Acute infarction was assessed from diffusion-weighted imaging in a subset of people with TIA. Twenty-two people with TIA were assessed. Robotic assessment showed impaired upper limb motor function in 7/22 people with TIA patients and upper limb sensory impairment in 4/22 individuals. Cognitive tasks involving robotic assessment of the upper limb were completed in 13 participants, of whom 8 (61.5%) showed significant impairment. Abnormal performance in the CMSA arm inventory was present in 12/22 (54.5%) participants. ARWMC was 11.8 ± 6.4 and CMI was 5.4 ± 1.5. DWI was positive in 0 participants. Quantitative robotic assessment showed that people who have had a TIA display a spectrum of upper limb motor and sensory performance deficits as well as cognitive function deficits despite resolution of symptoms and no evidence of tissue infarction."
"29271534","Vascular risk factors and depression in Parkinson's disease.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to address the vascular depression hypothesis in Parkinson's disease (PD) from a large cohort of Chinese population.METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of 1784 Chinese patients with PD was conducted. Patients were divided into absence of depression (score = 20) and presence of depression (score &gt; 20) based on assessment of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Other clinical assessments included the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the frontal assessment battery (FAB) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).RESULTS: Patients with depression showed a higher proportion of women, longer disease duration, higher UPDRS part III score, higher levodopa equivalent daily dose use, higher occurrences of motor fluctuation and dyskinesia, lower FAB score and lower MoCA score than those without depression (P &lt; 0.05). The proportions of drinking and overweight/obesity in the depression group were significantly lower than those in the non-depression group (P &lt; 0.05). A forward binary logistic regression model indicated that depression in PD was associated with female sex [odds ratio (OR) 1.376, P = 0.025], higher UPDRS part III score (OR 1.042, P &lt; 0.001), lower FAB score (OR 0.937, P = 0.015), anxiety (OR 18.156, P &lt; 0.001) and overweight/obesity (OR 0.700, P = 0.019), whereas no associations were found with hypertension, diabetes, smoking, drinking, hyperlipidaemia and heart disease.CONCLUSIONS: Our study failed to verify the vascular depression hypothesis in PD. On the contrary, it was demonstrated that overweight/obesity is negatively associated with the presence of depression in PD."
"29262796","Malnutrition-inflammation is a risk factor for cerebral small vessel diseases and cognitive decline in peritoneal dialysis patients: a cross-sectional observational study.","BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease patients have an increased prevalence of subclinical cerebrovascular diseases. Dialysis patients have severe vascular diseases burden. The cerebral small vessel diseases (CSVD) are difficult to find by clinical assessment. The evaluation of CVSD needs MRI. Cognitive impairment is a consequence of CVSD which is diagnosed by cognitive testing. These limited the study of CVSD and cognitive function in dialysis patients. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients are minority of dialysis population. We know even fewer about the CVSD in this special population.METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled 72 PD patients who received care at the Peking Union Medical College hospital peritoneal dialysis center. CSVD were assessed by brain MR images. Cognitive function was evaluated with the Chinese version of the MMSE and MoCA.RESULTS: In our PD patients, the brain MRI showed the prevalence different signs of CSVD were: lacunar infarcts 38.9%, microbleeds 36.1%, abnormal brain white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) 48.6%, and intracerebral hemorrhage 4.2%. 25% and 86.8%of our patients could be diagnosed as cognitive impairment, according to the MMSE and MoCA test, respectively. nPCR was lower in patients with a lacunar infarct or intracerebral hemorrhage, and relative to the MMSA/MoCA score; hsCRP was higher in patients with lacunar infarct or abnormal WMHs and negative relative to the MMSA/MoCA score. In logistic regression analyses, nPCR was an independent risk factor for lacunar infarcts and impaired cognitive function. The presence of lacunar infarct was an independent risk factor for cognitive function decline.CONCLUSION: We demonstrated a high prevalence of CSVD and cognitive impairment in our PD patients. Lacunar infarct was the main kind of CVSD responsible for PD patients cognitive function decline. Our novel observation also revealed an association between malnutrition-inflammation and CSVD."

The influence of hypertension as modifiable risk factor in the evolution of cognitive impairment is emphasized in numerous investigations. Almost all the proposed in research literature data were obtained from the investigation of old patients group, who had high indexes of blood pressure and stroke histories. Therefore, we think that it is very impotent to detect the slight and moderate cognitive impairment of hypertensive patients of working age until the expressed clinical signs appear. Objective - determine the age and hypertension duration influence on the evolution of cognitive impairments in patients with essential hypertension of the second stage. There were examined 102 patients with essential hypertension of the second stage, which had not any attendant illnesses. Their average years were about 49,84±0,83 average. Disease duration was approximately 8,78±0,60. According to the purpose of examination all patients were divided by age and disease duration into 3 groups. To study cognitive impairment used a number of neuropsychological tests. Analyzing the MoCA test data of examined patients it should be noted a tendency to decreasing of cognitive function indexes with age increasing. Thus, the patients of the first group have no cognitive impairment. But authentic lowering of MoCA test results may be noted in the patients group of 56 years and higher, up to 6,1% in comparison with the patients under 45 years. The indexes of MoCA test in the group of patients with arterial hypertension duration more than 10 years were authentically lower comparing with the group of patients with disease duration up to 5 years and patients with arterial hypertension duration of 5 to 10 years in 9,9% and in 4,9% accordantly. We have found that with increasing duration of the disease and age the working age patients with essential hypertension of the second stage, significant increase in cognitive impairment was observed. Diagnosing of cognitive impairment is the measure of prevention of dementia in future and it must be an inseparable part of system examination of hypertensive patients."
"29111025","Orthostatic hypotension associated with executive dysfunction in mild cognitive impairment.","INTRODUCTION: Midlife hypertension is associated with dementia in longitudinal studies while chronic hypotension in the elderly is associated with dementia onset. Orthostatic hypotension could influence cognitive performance in the elderly. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between orthostatic hypotension and cognitive functions.METHODS: Consecutive participants with complete neuropsychological evaluation from a Memory Clinic were included. Orthostatic hypotension (OH) was defined by a fall=20/10mmHg systolic/diastolic pressure. Participants were classified into one of 3 groups: 1) subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), 2) mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 3) dementia. Neuropsychological tests were analyzed for patients with and without OH.RESULTS: One hundred and twenty participants were included, of which 16 (13%) were classified as SCI, 42 (35%) as MCI, and 63 (52%) with dementia. Prevalence of OH was 0% for the SCI group, 26% (n=11) for the MCI group, and 38% (n=24) for the dementia group. Age, sex, education, and brief cognitive test scores (MMSE &amp; MoCA) were not different between groups with or without OH. In the MCI group, OH was associated with lower cognitive performance in several executive functions tests: visual working memory (p&lt;0.001), processing speed (p=0.006), Stroop flexibility (p=0.030) and Trail-Making Test part B (p=0.024). There was no difference in episodic memory performance. OH was associated with a diagnosis of hypertension and the use of antihypertensive medication. No differences were observed in vascular brain injury between groups with and without OH.CONCLUSIONS: This study found that orthostatic hypotension prevalence is correlated to severity of cognitive deficits in a Memory Clinic. In MCI, OH is associated with lower performance in executive functions. OH could represent an under-recognized correlate of cognitive performance."

However, behavioral measures of cognition are difficult to obtain in the acute phase of recovery due to clinical factors (e.g. fatigue) and functional barriers (e.g. language deficits). The aim of the current study was to test whether single channel wireless EEG data obtained acutely following stroke could predict longer-term cognitive function.METHODS: Resting state Relative Power (RP) of delta, theta, alpha, beta, delta/alpha ratio (DAR), and delta/theta ratio (DTR) were obtained from a single electrode over FP1 in 24 participants within 72 hours of a first-ever stroke. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was administered at 90-days post-stroke. Correlation and regression analyses were completed to identify relationships between 90-day cognitive function and electrophysiological data, neurological status, and demographic characteristics at admission.RESULTS: Four acute qEEG indices demonstrated moderate to high correlations with 90-day MoCA scores: DTR (r = -0.57, p = 0.01), RP theta (r = 0.50, p = 0.01), RP delta (r = -0.47, p = 0.02), and DAR (r = -0.45, p = 0.03). Acute DTR (b = -0.36, p &lt; 0.05) and stroke severity on admission (b = -0.63, p &lt; 0.01) were the best linear combination of predictors of MoCA scores 90-days post-stroke, accounting for 75% of variance.CONCLUSIONS: Data generated by a single pre-frontal electrode support the prognostic value of acute DAR, and identify DTR as a potential marker of post-stroke cognitive outcome. Use of single channel recording in an acute clinical setting may provide an efficient and valid predictor of cognitive function after stroke."
"28959202","A 58-Year Old Male with Cognitive Deteriorations Caused by Septum Pellucidum Cyst: A Case Report.","Dementia is known to be induced by vascular dementia and certain neurodegenerative diseases. The presenting features of disordered memory, intellect and personality often result in referral to a neurologist initially. Septum pellucidum cyst (SPC) is a rare clinical finding and defined as a cystic structure between the lateral ventricles. SPC induced memory disorder and dementia has been seldom reported in which the clinical features are atypical and can be misdiagnosed. The main difficulty is to establish a correlation between symptoms and the cyst. When indicated, the treatment is essentially surgical and the ideal operative technique is also a matter of debate. Here, we reported a 58-year-male Chinese patient who presented with memory impairment 1 year ago. Both the physical and laboratory examinations were performed to evaluate the general conditions of the patient. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was applied to observe SPC and the neighboring brain structures. Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were used to assess cognitive function. The results of the patient's laboratory examinations were normal. However, the patient exhibited severe sleeplessness along with cognitive deteriorations despite short-term (less than 2 weeks) use of benzodiazepines with regular dose. MRI fulfills the consensus criteria for clinical diagnosis of SPC. Furthermore, the results of MMSE and MoCA were showed mild cognitive impairment (MCI) before the treatment of SPC. After neuroendoscopic fenestration of SPC, the patient's syndromes were disappeared, and his cognitive function was improved. In conclusion, the patient's symptoms were due to a secondary lesion attributed to the cyst. Comprehensive clinical evaluation and MRI help diagnose SPC induced dementia."

According to cognitive function, the patients were divided into a group of normal cognitive function, a mild cognitive impairment group (MCI group) and a dementia group. The patients were also divided into normal a blood sugar group, an impaired glucose regulation group (IGR group) and a diabetes mellitus (DM) group based on glucose metabolism. Cognitive functions of patients in the different glucose metabolism groups were compared based on Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). General data, medical history, neuropsychological assessment and haematological index of the patients in each group were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was used to study independent risk factors influencing cognitive impairment. When comparing the group of normal cognitive function with the MCI group, there were no statistical significant differences between the MMSEs scores of patients among the three groups, but the difference in MoCAs scores had statistical significance. Hypertension history, hyperhomocysteinemia (Hhcy) and sedentariness were independent risk factors for SAO patients with MCI. When comparing the group of normal cognitive function with the dementia group, there were statistically significant differences (P&lt;0.05) between the MMSE and MoCA scores of patients among the three groups. Abnormal glucose metabolism, old age, female, high blood pressure, Hhcy, family stroke history and sedentariness were independent risk factors for SAO patients with dementia. In conclusion, abnormal glucose metabolism impairing cognitive function is not an independent risk factor for SAO patients with MCI, but is an independent risk factor for SAO patients with dementia."

Specific deficits in the cognitive domains of executive functioning and visuo-constructional abilities were also independently predicted by diastolic dysfunction (P &lt; 0.05).Mild cognitive impairment is prevalent in patients with subclinical chronic heart disease at high-risk of CHF. Independent associations with LV diastolic dysfunction suggest a link between cardiac and cognitive functioning beyond shared risk factors.</AbstractText>: Mild cognitive impairment is prevalent in patients with subclinical chronic heart disease at high-risk of CHF.

"28934304","The significant effects of cerebral microbleeds on cognitive dysfunction: An updated meta-analysis.","OBJECTIVE: Accumulated data suggests that cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) play an important role in the decline of cognitive function, but the results remain inconsistent. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the association between CMBs and cognitive function, as well as the various effects of CMBs on different domains of cognition.METHODS: We searched through the databases of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ScienceDirect. After a consistency test, the publication bias was evaluated and a sensitivity analysis was performed with combined odds ratios (OR) and standardized mean difference (SMD) of CMBs.RESULTS: A meta-analysis of 25 studies with 9343 participants total was conducted. Patients with CMBs had higher incidence of cognitive impairment (OR:3.5410; 95% confidence interval [CI] [2.2979, 5.4567], p&lt;0.05) and lower scores of cognitive functions (SMD: -0.2700 [-0.4267, -0.1133], p&lt;0.05 in Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] group and -0.4869 [-0.8902, -0.0818], p&lt;0.05 in Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] group). Our results also indicated that patients with CMBs had obvious decline in cognitive functions, for instance, orientation (SMD: -0.9565 [-1.7260, -0.1869], p&lt;0.05), attention and calculation (SMD: -1.1518 [-1.9553, -0.3484], p&lt;0.05) and delayed recall (SMD: -0.5527 [-1.1043, -0.0011], p = 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that CMBs might be an important risk factor for cognitive dysfunction, especially in the domains of orientation, attention and calculation and delayed recall functions. Prospective cohort studies with further investigations will be needed in larger samples."

"28887072","Minimum Clinically Important Difference of Montreal Cognitive Assessment in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients.","Cognitive impairment is a major factor contributing to poor functional outcome after subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by a ruptured cerebral aneurysm (aSAH). Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has been shown to be superior to the Mini-Mental State Examination in screening for cognitive domain deficit and correlating to functional outcome in aSAH patients. The aim of the current study was to determine the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score change that was associated with change of health in general in an aSAH patient cohort. We recruited aSAH patients from a regional neurosurgical center over a 3-year period. Patient assessments including MoCA and global rating of change (GRoC) were carried out at at 3 and 12months after aSAH. Anchor-based and distribution-based approaches were adopted to calculate the Minimum Clinically Important Difference (MID). One hundred and seventy-five aSAH patients completed both 3-month and 1-year assessments and consented for participation. Employing the distribution-based approach for the 3-month and 1-year MoCA scores, the MID estimates equated to a change of 2.0 and 1.1 respectively. Employing the anchor-based approach (with GRoC), the MID estimate of MoCA (median, IQR) was 2, 1-4. In conclusion, we found that the MID of MoCA score associated with change of health in general in aSAH patients was 2. The MID provides guidance for future clinical trial design targeting on cognitive dysfunction after aSAH."

"28810566","Correlation analysis between the LDL-C in serum and the onset of transient ischemic attack caused by CSVD.","The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in serum and the onset of transient ischemic attack caused by cerebral small vascular disease (CSVD). Between September 2012 and September 2015, 249 patients who were diagnosed as CSVD were randomly enrolled in this study. According to MRI results, patients were divided into the patient and control groups. In the patient group, the patients were further subdivided into the white matter lesion (WML) group (n=86) and lacunar infarction (LI) group (n=53). Head MRI and/or CT were conducted on all the patients. This included T1 and T2 phases, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR). Additionally, mini-mental status examination (MMSE) test and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) test were carried out on all the patients. As a result, the age, total cholesterol (TC) level and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in the patient group were higher than those in the control group (p&lt;0.05). The MMSE and MoCA scores in the patient group were significantly lower than those in the control group (p&lt;0.05). With all the risk factors being set as independent variables and small vessel disease (SVD) as the dependent variable, we performed the logistic regression analysis and correlation analysis for paired data, and found that the increase in LDL was correlated to the onset of SVD, OR=1,321. After adjustment of other risk factors, we enrolled the level of triglyceride (TG) into the multivariable analysis and obtained a statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.05). In conclusion, LDL is a major risk factor affecting the onset of transient ischemic attack (TIA) induced by CSVD. Patients with hyperlipidemia should receive head MRI or CT examination to eliminate the probability of the existence of CSVD. To reduce the occurrence of adverse events in clinical practice, we can perform early intervention in SVD by decreasing the level of LDL, improving the endothelial function of small vessels and applying the anti-inflammation and nerve-protection methods."

"28653212","Higher blood-brain barrier permeability is associated with higher white matter hyperintensities burden.","The pathogenesis of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) is incompletely understood but blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction may play a key role. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between BBB permeability and the severity of WMH burden. Consecutive participants without symptomatic stroke history presented for physical examination were recruited in this cross-sectional study and divided into three WMH burden groups according to total Fazekas scores. They received dynamic contrast-enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging to measure BBB permeability, and received Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). A total of 102 participants aged 49-90 years (mean age of 69.82 years) were enrolled (36 with low WMH burden, 35 with medium WMH burden, and 31 with high WMH burden). Multivariable linear regression analyses revealed that participants with higher WMH burden had significantly higher BBB leakage rate and area under the leakage curve in normal-appearing white matter, WMH, cortical gray matter, and deep gray matter (DGM) after adjustment for age, sex, and vascular risk factors. Scores on MMSE and MoCA decreased with increasing leakage rate in WMH and DGM after adjustment for age, sex, WMH burden, and education years. We found that higher BBB permeability is associated with higher WMH burden and cognitive decline. The compromised BBB integrity may be a critical contributor to the pathogenesis of WMH and part of a series of pathological processes that finally lead to cognitive impairment."
"28600443","Prevalence, risk factors and consequences of cerebral small vessel diseases: data from three Asian countries.","BACKGROUND: Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) has been suggested to be more common in Asians compared with Caucasians. However, data from population-based studies in Asia are lacking. We report on the prevalence, risk factors and consequences of SVD from contemporary studies in three Asian countries using 3-Tesla MRI for the evaluation of SVD.METHODS: Clinical, cognitive and 3-Tesla brain MRI assessments were performed among participants of three studies from Singapore, Hong Kong and Korea. SVD markers include white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) using the modified Fazekas scale, lacunes and microbleeds. Cognition was assessed using the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Adjustments were made for age, sex and cardiovascular risk factors.RESULTS: A total of 1797 subjects were available for analysis (mean age: 70.1±6.3 years and 57% women). The prevalence of confluent WMH was 36.6%, lacunes, 24.6% and microbleeds, 26.9%. Presence of all three SVD markers showed a steeper increase with increasing age rising from 1.9% in the lowest to 46.2% in the highest 5-year age strata. The major risk factors for the increased severity of SVD markers were advancing age and hypertension. Moreover, increasing severity of SVD markers was independently associated with worse performance on MMSE and MoCA.CONCLUSION: Elderly Asians have a high burden of SVD which was associated with cognitive dysfunction. This suggests that SVD markers should be a potential target for treatment in clinical trials so as to delay progression of cerebrovascular disease and potentially cognitive decline."
"28594795","[Assessing efficacy of carotid endarterectomy by means of intraoperative flowmetry].","AIM: The study was aimed at determining volumetric blood flow velocity (VBFV) through the internal carotid artery (ICA) and assessing functional outcomes of treatment of patients, taking into consideration the dynamics of VBFV before and after the operation.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study comprised a total of 53 patients subjected to examination of VBFV through the ICA before and after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) assessed by means of flowmetry. Neurological deficit was evaluated by means of the NIHS Scale (the M NIHSS prior to operation equalling 2.49), the degree of disability and functional independence of the patient after endured stroke was assessed by the modified Rankin Scale (the M mRS before operation amounting to 1.23) and the Rivermead Mobility Index, the severity of cognitive dysfunctions was determined by the Mini-Mental State Examination (the M MMSE before surgery equalling 24.85) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale (the M MoCA before surgery scoring 23.3).RESULTS: At the first stage of examination we determined that the VBFV after the operation increased in all patients, but the highest values of the increment were observed in groups of patients with ICA stenoses of 80-89% and 90-99%. During the second stage, it was determined that with a higher value of the VBFV after carotid endarterectomy regression of neurological deficit occurred faster (the postoperative M NIHSS scoring 2.09, with the M mRS of 1.00), the patients demonstrated higher results while undergoing the tests for intellectual ability (the postoperative MMSE and MoCA equalling 25.4 and 23.91, respectively) compared with the patients showing low values of the increment of the VBFV after the operation.CONCLUSION: Intraoperative flowmetry is a simple and efficient method of evaluating the VBFV through the ICA, an increase in volumetric blood flow (VBF) contributes to restoration of normal perfusion of the brain and creates prerequisites for more complete and faster restoration of the lost functions after ischaemic stroke (IS) and chronic cerebral ischaemia."
"28495909","Pulse wave velocity is associated with cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients.","Cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients is common and associated with adverse outcomes. So far, the underlying pathogenesis remains unclear. Therefore, we examined the potential relationship between cognitive impairment and three different categories of risk factors with particular focus on arterial stiffness measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV). A total of 201 chronic hemodialysis patients underwent cognitive testing under standardized conditions using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Demographic data including cardiovascular risk factors, dialysis-associated factors as well as factors related to chronic kidney disease (CKD) were analyzed. To account for arterial stiffness, PWV was measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoried with an oscillometric device that records brachial blood pressure along with pulse waves. In our cohort, 60.2% of patients showed pathological MoCA test results indicating cognitive impairment. PWV was significantly associated with cognitive impairment apart from age, educational level, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. High prevalence of cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients was confirmed. For the first time, an association between cognitive impairment and arterial stiffness was detected in a larger cohort of hemodialysis patients. Concerning the underlying pathogenesis of cognitive impairment, current results revealed a potential involvement of arterial stiffness, which has to be further evaluated in future studies."
"28489814","Diagnostic Values of Serum Levels of Homocysteine and Uric Acid for Predicting Vascular Mild Cognitive Impairment in Patients with Cerebral Small Vessel Disease.","BACKGROUND This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic values of serum levels of Hcy and UA for predicting vascular mild cognitive impairment (VMCI) in patients with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). MATERIAL AND METHODS We selected 172 cerebral SVD patients and divided them into a VMCI group and a non-VMCI group. Eighty-six healthy individuals without nervous system diseases were selected as the control group. Enzymatic cycling method was performed to detect serum Hcy and UA levels. Serum levels of folic acid (FOA) and vitamin B12 (VitB12) were detected by chemiluminescence immunoassay. Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) was applied to evaluate the cognitive function. The ROC curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic values of serum Hcy and UA levels for predicting VMCI. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the possible risk factors. RESULTS Compared with the non-VMCI and control groups, serum FOA and VitB12 levels were lower and serum Hcy and UA levels were higher in the VMCI group. AUC values of serum Hcy and UA levels were 0.703 and 0.829, respectively. Serum Hcy and UA levels were negatively correlated with serum FOA and VitB12 levels, total MoCA score, and subscores on visuospatial ability and executive function, on language ability and on delayed recall, and they were positively correlated with serum cholesterol (CH) level. Serum Hcy and UA levels were indicated as risk factors for VMCI in cerebral SVD patients. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that serum Hcy and UA levels may serve as predictive factors for VMCI in cerebral SVD patients."
"28487471","Using DTI to assess white matter microstructure in cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) in multicentre studies.","Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) have been proposed as clinical trial markers of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) due to their associations with outcomes such as cognition. However, studies investigating this have been predominantly single-centre. As clinical trials are likely to be multisite, further studies are required to determine whether associations with cognition of similar strengths can be detected in a multicentre setting. One hundred and nine patients (mean age =68 years) with symptomatic lacunar infarction and confluent white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on MRI was recruited across six sites as part of the PRESERVE DTI substudy. After handling missing data, 3T-MRI scanning was available from five sites on five scanner models (Siemens and Philips), alongside neuropsychological and quality of life (QoL) assessments. FA median and MD peak height were extracted from DTI histogram analysis. Multiple linear regressions were performed, including normalized brain volume, WMH lesion load, and n° lacunes as covariates, to investigate the association of FA and MD with cognition and QoL. DTI metrics from all white matter were significantly associated with global cognition (standardized ß =0.268), mental flexibility (ß =0.306), verbal fluency (ß =0.376), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (ß =0.273). The magnitudes of these associations were comparable with those previously reported from single-centre studies found in a systematic literature review. In this multicentre study, we confirmed associations between DTI parameters and cognition, which were similar in strength to those found in previous single-centre studies. The present study supports the use of DTI metrics as biomarkers of disease progression in multicentre studies."

Calpain-10 belongs to a commonly expressed member of the Calpain-like cysteine protease family, which acts as risk marker for some diseases. The purpose of this study is to elucidate correlation between Calpain-10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the incidence of OSAHS followed by ischemic stroke (IS).METHODS: OSAHS patients were divided as OSAHS<U+200A>+<U+200A>IS, OSAHS, and control groups, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was performed for Calpain-10 protein expression, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism for detection of gene polymorphisms of SNP 43 and SNP 19, and PCR-allele specific amplification for SNP 44. Polysomnography was conducted to check the nocturnal polysomnography indicators, and also Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Scientific Data System scores cognition and anxiety of patients, respectively. Logistic analysis was used for the risky factors for OSAHS.RESULTS: Calpain-10 protein expression was significantly increased in the OSAHS<U+200A>+<U+200A>IS and OSAHS groups compared with the control group. Significant differences in SNP 43 and SNP 44 genotype, and also allele frequency were observed in 3 groups, among which the OSAHS<U+200A>+<U+200A>IS group had higher SNP 43 and SNP 44 allele frequency than the control and OSAHS groups. There were differences regarding apnea-hypopnea index, minimum fingertip blood oxygen saturation (LSaO2 [%]), oxygen reduction index (ODI) between patients with different genotypes of SNP 43 and SNP 44 in OSAHS patients, and also GC and AT frequency in the OSAHS<U+200A>+<U+200A>IS and OSAHS groups. As compared with the OSAHS group, the MoCA scores and MoCA subitems in the OSAHS<U+200A>+<U+200A>IS group were declined, whereas the Scientific Data System scores were elevated. Additionally, GG 43 genotype, high apnea-hypopnea index, and body mass index were detected as the risk factors of OSAHS.CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that the Calpain-10 SNP 43 may be related to OSAHS with IS, with SNP 43 GG genotype as a risk factor for OSAHS with IS."
"28376127","The &quot;DOC&quot; screen: Feasible and valid screening for depression, Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and cognitive impairment in stroke prevention clinics.","BACKGROUND: Post-stroke Depression, Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and Cognitive impairment (&quot;DOC&quot;) are associated with greater mortality, worse recovery and poorer quality of life. Best practice recommendations endorse routine screening for each condition; yet, all are under-assessed, diagnosed and treated. We seek to determine the feasibility and validity of an integrated tool (&quot;DOC&quot; screen) to identify stroke clinic patients at high-risk of depression, OSA, and cognitive impairment.METHODS: All consecutive new referrals to a regional Stroke Prevention Clinic who were English-speaking and non-aphasic were eligible to be screened. Time for screen completion was logged. DOC screen results were compared to the neuropsychological battery and polysomnogram assessments using a modified receiver operator characteristic and area under the curve analysis. Data is reported to conform to STARD guidelines.FINDINGS: 1503 people were screened over 2 years. 89% of eligible patients completed the screen in 5 minutes or less (mean 4.2 minutes), less than half the time it takes to complete the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). 437 people consented to detailed testing. Of those, 421 completed the Structured Clinical Interview for Depression within 3 months of screening, 387 completed detailed neuropsychological testing within 3 months, and 88 had overnight polysomnograms. Screening scores combined with demographic variables (age, sex, education, body mass index), had excellent validity compared to gold standard diagnoses: DOC-Mood AUC 0.90; DOC-Apnea AUC 0.80; DOC-Cog AUC 0.81. DOC screen scores can reliably categorize patients in to low-, intermediate- or high-risk groups for further action and can do so with comparable accuracy to more time-consuming screens.CONCLUSIONS: Systematic screening of depression, obstructive sleep apnea, and cognitive impairment in 5 minutes or less is feasible and valid in a high volume stroke clinic using the DOC screen. The DOC screen may facilitate improved identification and treatment of these comorbidities to improve function in patients after stroke and in those with other neurological diseases that share these comorbid conditions (e.g. Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment, Parkinson's disease, Traumatic Brain Injury, multiple sclerosis)."

The scores of MoCA and MMSE were considered to have declined if there were a reduction of =2 points in the respective scores measured across two time points. The decline in neuropsychological diagnosis transitional status was defined by a category transition from no cognitive impairment or any cognitive impairment to a more severe cognitive impairment or dementia.RESULTS: 275 patients with a mean age of 59.8 ± 11.6 years, and education of 7.7 ± 4.3 years completed all the assessments at baseline, 3-6 months and 1-year follow-ups. A decline in MoCA scores from 3-6 months to 1 year was associated with higher risk of decline in diagnosis transitional status (odd ratio = 3.21, p = 0.004) in the same time period whereas there was no association with a decline in MMSE scores.CONCLUSIONS: The decline in MoCA scores from 3-6 months to 1 year after stroke/TIA has three times higher risk for decline in the diagnosis transitional status. The decline of MoCA scores (reduction = 2points) is associated with the decline in neuropsychological diagnosis transitional status."
"28333925","Video-based educational intervention associated with improved stroke literacy, self-efficacy, and patient satisfaction.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Interventions are needed to improve stroke literacy among recent stroke survivors. We developed an educational video for patients hospitalized with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).METHODS: A 5-minute stroke education video was shown to our AIS and ICH patients admitted from March to June 2015. Demographics and a 5-minute protocol Montreal Cognitive Assessment were also collected. Questions related to stroke knowledge, self-efficacy, and patient satisfaction were answered before, immediately after, and 30 days after the video.RESULTS: Among 250 screened, 102 patients consented, and 93 completed the video intervention. There was a significant difference between pre-video median knowledge score of 6 (IQR 4-7) and the post-video score of 7 (IQR 6-8; p&lt;0.001) and between pre-video and the 30 day score of 7 (IQR 5-8; p = 0.04). There was a significant difference between the proportion of patients who were very certain in recognizing symptoms of a stroke pre- and post-video, which was maintained at 30-days (35.5% vs. 53.5%, p = 0.01; 35.5% vs. 54.4%, p = 0.02). The proportion who were &quot;very satisfied&quot; with their education post-video (74.2%) was significantly higher than pre-video (49.5%, p&lt;0.01), and this was maintained at 30 days (75.4%, p&lt;0.01). There was no association between MoCA scores and stroke knowledge acquisition or retention. There was no association between stroke knowledge acquisition and rates of home blood pressure monitoring or primary care provider follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: An educational video was associated with improved stroke knowledge, self-efficacy in recognizing stroke symptoms, and satisfaction with education in hospitalized stroke patients, which was maintained at 30 days after discharge."
"28319944","Time-of-Day Could Affect Cognitive Screening Performance in Older Patients with TIA and Stroke.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The impact of time-of-day on the cognitive performance of older patients with limited cognitive reserve after a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke, and on short cognitive tests, such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), is unknown. We retrospectively studied whether morning versus afternoon assessment might affect the classification of patients aged 70 or older as severe (SCI), mild (MCI), and no (NCI) cognitive impairment by the MoCA.METHODS: Morning (12 p.m. or earlier) versus afternoon (later than 12 p.m.) proportions of SCI (MoCA score &lt;20), MCI (MoCA score 25-20) and NCI (MoCA score =26) were compared in a cohort of patients aged =70, attending a rapid-access TIA/stroke clinic.RESULTS: Of 278 patients, 113 (40.6%) were tested in the morning and 165 (59.4%) in the afternoon. The proportion with SCI was greater in the afternoon than in the morning (10.9 vs. 1.8%, respectively, p = 0.004), with no difference in age, education, diagnosis, disability, or vascular risk factors.CONCLUSIONS: Time-of-day appears to affect cognitive performance of older patients after they undergo TIA and minor stroke. If our cross-sectional findings are confirmed in cross-over studies with repeated testing, timing of assessments should be considered in clinical practice and in research studies."

"28260915","Prevalence of mild cognitive impairment in employable patients after acute coronary event in cardiac rehabilitation.","INTRODUCTION: Adequate cognitive function in patients is a prerequisite for successful implementation of patient education and lifestyle coping in comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs. Although the association between cardiovascular diseases and cognitive impairments (CIs) is well known, the prevalence particularly of mild CI in CR and the characteristics of affected patients have been insufficiently investigated so far.METHODS: In this prospective observational study, 496 patients (54.5 ± 6.2 years, 79.8% men) with coronary artery disease following an acute coronary event (ACE) were analyzed. Patients were enrolled within 14 days of discharge from the hospital in a 3-week inpatient CR program. Patients were tested for CI using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) upon admission to and discharge from CR. Additionally, sociodemographic, clinical, and physiological variables were documented. The data were analyzed descriptively and in a multivariate stepwise backward elimination regression model with respect to CI.CONCLUSION: The prevalence of CI in CR was considerably high, affecting more than one-third of cardiac patients. Besides age and education level, CI was associated with heavy workloads and a longer sick leave before ACE."
"28236597","Cognitive Change 1 Year after CEA or CAS Compared with Medication.","BACKGROUND: Whether improvement of cognitive function can be maintained remains controversial.AIMS: This study aimed to investigate cognitive changes between before carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS) and 1 year after intervention using cognitive evaluation tools.METHODS: Patients suspected as having carotid stenosis were prospectively registered for evaluation of cognitive function from October 2011 to December 2013 in the Department of Neurosurgery, Fukuoka University Hospital. Cognitive evaluation by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were performed before and 1 year after CEA or CAS. Cognitive changes were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, whereas the subscores of MoCA and MMSE were also compared.RESULTS: The MoCA score was significantly ameliorated from 21 to 23 at 1 year after CEA (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.003), but the MMSE score did not significantly change (24 to 25, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.56). Additionally, the MoCA score was improved 1 year after CAS (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.04), but it was unchanged in those who were treated medically (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.15). Regarding the analyses of subscores, patients who had CEA improved in the areas of executive and memory functions, whereas those with medical treatment only showed improvement in memory. CAS did not improve any subscores. There was no significant improvement in the subscores of the MMSE in patients with CEA, CAS, or medical treatment 1 year after treatment compared with before treatment.CONCLUSIONS: CEA or CAS may be significantly associated with cognitive improvement as evaluated by the MoCA. However, patients treated medically do not show improvement in cognitive performance."
"28230198","Longitudinal association of hypertension and diabetes mellitus with cognitive functioning in a general 70-year-old population: the SONIC study.","Both hypertension and diabetes in middle-aged individuals have been suggested to be predictive indicators of cognitive decline. However, the association of hypertension, diabetes and their combination with cognitive functioning is still controversial in older people. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between cognitive decline and hypertension, diabetes, and their combination in 70-year-old people based on a 3-year longitudinal analysis. Four hundred and fifty-four people aged 70 (±1) years who participated in the Japanese longitudinal cohort study of Septuagenarians, Octogenarians and Nonagenarians Investigation with Centenarians (SONIC) were recruited randomly from a general population and were monitored for 3 years. The data, including most of the demographics, cognitive functioning measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Japanese version (MoCA-J), blood pressure, blood chemistry and other medical histories, were collected at baseline and during the follow-up. The prevalence of hypertension noted in the follow-up survey was significantly higher than than noted at baseline. The mean MoCA-J score at follow-up was not significantly different from the score obtained at baseline. However, the participants with diabetes, especially combined with hypertension at baseline, had significantly lower MoCA-J scores than those without lifestyle-related diseases. The combination of hypertension and diabetes was still a significant risk factor for cognitive decline, considering the MoCA-J scores obtained during the follow-up after adjustments at baseline, relative to sex, body mass index, dyslipidemia, smoking, excessive alcohol intake, antihypertensive treatment and education level (ß=-0.14; P&lt;0.01). Our findings indicate that diabetes and the combination of hypertension and diabetes are clear risk factors for future cognitive decline in elderly individuals who are 70 years of age."
"28205215","Multicenter Validation of an MMSE-MoCA Conversion Table.","BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence points to the superiority of the MoCA over the MMSE as a cognitive screening tool. To facilitate the transition from the MMSE to the MoCA in clinical and research settings, authors have developed MMSE-MoCA conversion tables. However, it is unknown whether a conversion table generated from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients would apply to patients with other dementia subtypes like vascular dementia or frontotemporal dementia. Furthermore, the reliability and accuracy of MMSE-MoCA conversion tables has not been properly evaluated.METHOD: We retrospectively examined the MMSE-MoCA relationship in a large multicenter sample gathered from 3 Memory Clinics in Quebec, Canada (1492 patients). We produced an MMSE-MoCA conversion table using the equi-percentile method with log-linear smoothing. We then cross-validated our conversion table with the ADNI dataset (1202 patients) and evaluated its accuracy for future predictions.RESULTS: The MMSE-MoCA conversion table is consistent with previously published tables and has an intra-class correlation of 0.633 with the ADNI sample. However, we found that the MMSE-MoCA relationship is significantly modified by diagnosis (P &lt; .01), with dementia subtypes associated with a dysexecutive syndrome showing a trend towards higher MMSE than other dementia syndromes for a given MoCA score. The large width of 95% confidence interval (CI) for a new prediction suggests questionable reliability for clinical use.CONCLUSION: In this study, we validated a conversion table between MMSE and MoCA using a large multicenter sample. Our results suggest caution in interpreting the tables in heterogeneous clinical populations, as the MMSE-MoCA relationship may be different across dementia subtypes."
"28189742","Abnormal cortical functional activity in patients with ischemic white matter lesions: A resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study.","There is increasing evidence that white matter lesions (WMLs) are associated with cognitive impairments. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship of WMLs with cognitive impairments from the aspect of cortical functional activity. Briefly, Sixteen patients with ischemic WMLs and 13 controls participated in this study. A regional homogeneity (ReHo) approach was used to investigate altered neural coherence in patients with ischemic WMLs during the resting state. A correlation analysis was further performed between regions with altered ReHo and cognitive test scores, including Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), in the patient group. Finally, we found regions with altered ReHo values in patients with ischemic WMLs to be involved in default mode network (DMN), frontal-parietal control network (FPCN), dorsal attention network (DAN), motor network and right temporal cortex. Moreover, some altered regions belonging to DMN, FPCN and motor network were significantly correlated with cognitive test scores. Our results provide neuroimaging evidence for the impairments of memory, attention, executive and motor function in patients with ischemic WMLs. It is interesting to note that the decreased ReHo was mainly in the anterior brain regions, while increased ReHo in the posterior brain regions, which may indicate a failure down regulation of spontaneous activity in posterior regions. In summary, this study indicates an important role of specific cortical dysfunction in cognitive associated with WMLs."

Cognitive function was assessed by the Beijing version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-BJ) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) before and 1 month after treatment, when high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and homocysteine (Hcy) were also detected. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was done for explore the independent risk factors for vascular dementia (VD).RESULTS: The proportion of cognitive impairment was significantly lower after treatment than before in both the Treatment (88% vs. 64%, P = 0.023) and Control (87% vs. 70%, P = 0.047) groups. Vascular dementia dropped from 30 to 10% in the Treatment (P = 0.035) and from 25.9 to 16.7% in the Control (P = 0.027) groups. Total cognitive improvement was more significant in the Treatment Group (P = 0.018); naming, memory, attention, and linguistic abilities were significantly improved (all P &lt; 0.05). Serum Hcy and hs-CRP levels were significantly lower in the Treatment Group than in the Control Group 1 month after treatment (P &lt; 0.05).DISCUSSION: Dl-3-n-butylphthalide could significantly improve the cognitive function of AIS patients 1 month after stroke. Hcy was involved in the incidence of VD 1 month after AIS. However, further studies are necessary because of differences between groups at baseline."
"28143956","Correlation between serum S100ß protein levels and cognitive dysfunction in patients with cerebral small vessel disease: a case-control study.","The present study was designed to explore the correlation between serum S100ß levels and cognitive dysfunction in patients with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). A total of 172 SVD patients participated in the study, and they were assigned to patients with no cognitive impairment (NCI group) and those with vascular cognitive impairment no dementia (VCIND group). In total, 105 people were recruited into the normal control group. Serum S100ß protein level was detected by ELISA. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was employed for the predictive value of serum S100ß in diagnosing SVD with cognitive dysfunction. Pearson correlation analysis was used to examine the association of S100ß level with mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and the association of S100ß levels with hypertension. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze risk factors of SVD. The serum S100ß levels in the VCIND group were higher than those in the NCI and normal control groups. Logistic regression analysis revealed that a high serum S100ß protein level, hypertension, and high low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) level were the independent risk factors for SVD. In addition, hypertension patients showed higher S100ß levels than those with normal blood pressure and the normal control group, and there was a positive correlation between S100ß level and blood pressure. The concentration of serum S100ß level was related to impairment of cognition function of VCIND patients, therefore, early detection of serum S100ß was of great value for diagnosis of SVD."
"28131163","The test accuracy of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) by stroke lateralisation.","BACKGROUND: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is an increasingly popular screening tool for detecting cognitive impairment post-stroke. However its' test accuracy by stroke lateralisation is as yet unknown.AIM: Our aim was to investigate whether the test accuracy of the MoCA differs by stroke lateralisation across different cognitive domains.METHODS: We retrospectively examined the cognitive profiles of 228 subacute stroke patients (86 Left, 142 Right), comparing MoCA-total and domain-specific scores with performance on detailed neuropsychological assessment.RESULTS: The prevalence of cognitive impairment detected on neuropsychological assessment was high and relatively comparable between the right and left hemisphere stroke groups (91% and 93% respectively). Notably however, 29% of the right stroke group and 6% of the left stroke group achieved a &quot;cognitively-intact&quot; MoCA score (=25). A high proportion of right stroke patients who had an overall MoCA-intact score were found to be impaired in intellectual functioning, processing speed, executive functions and non-verbal memory on neuropsychological assessment. Furthermore, a high proportion of patients who scored full-marks within a MoCA-specified domain, irrespective of their overall score, were found to have impairment on corresponding neuropsychological assessment for both stroke groups.CONCLUSIONS: Particular care needs to be taken in interpreting MoCA-intact performance for right hemisphere patients due to its poor sensitivity to right hemisphere deficits. Scoring maximum points within a MoCA-specified domain also does not necessarily indicate intact cognitive functioning in that domain. Clinicians should consider supplementing their MoCA assessment with additional tools to increase the test accuracy of detecting relevant cognitive impairments post-stroke."
"28125616","Evaluating the Effect of Cognitive Dysfunction on Mental Imagery in Patients with Stroke Using Temporal Congruence and the Imagined 'Timed Up and Go' Test (iTUG).","BACKGROUND: Motor imagery (MI) capacity may be altered following stroke. MI is evaluated by measuring temporal congruence between the timed performance of an imagined and an executed task. Temporal congruence between imagined and physical gait-related activities has not been evaluated following stroke. Moreover, the effect of cognitive dysfunction on temporal congruence is not known.OBJECTIVE: To assess temporal congruence between the Timed Up and Go test (TUG) and the imagined TUG (iTUG) tests in patients with stroke and to investigate the role played by cognitive dysfunctions in changes in temporal congruence.METHODS: TUG and iTUG performance were recorded and compared in twenty patients with chronic stroke and 20 controls. Cognitive function was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), the Frontal Assessment Battery at Bedside (FAB) and the Bells Test.RESULTS: The temporal congruence of the patients with stroke was significantly altered compared to the controls, indicating a loss of MI capacity (respectively 45.11 ±35.11 vs 24.36 ±17.91, p = 0.02). Furthermore, iTUG test results were positively correlated with pathological scores on the Bells Test (r = 0.085, p = 0.013), likely suggesting that impairment of attention was a contributing factor.CONCLUSION: These results highlight the importance of evaluating potential attention disorder in patients with stroke to optimise the use of MI for rehabilitation and recovery. However further study is needed to determine how MI should be used in the case of cognitive dysfunction."
"28118690","Poststroke QEEG informs early prognostication of cognitive impairment.","Cognitive impairment is a common consequence of stroke, but remains difficult to predict. We investigate the ability of early QEEG assessment to inform such prediction, using binary logistic regression. Thirty-five patients (12 female, ages 18-87) suffering middle cerebral artery, ischemic stroke were studied. Resting-state EEG was recorded 48-239 h after symptom onset. Relative power for delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands, delta:alpha ratio, and peak alpha frequency were analyzed. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was administered, where possible, on day of EEG and at median 99 days (range 69-138) poststroke. Eight patients could not complete the baseline MoCA, and four the follow-up MoCA, for varying reasons (most commonly, stroke symptoms). Fifteen patients (48%) had cognitive impairment (MoCA score =25) at follow-up. One QEEG index was able to correctly predict presence/absence of cognitive impairment in 24/31 patients (77.4%), whereas predischarge MoCA did so in 23 patients. This index, relative theta frequency (4-7.5 Hz) power, was computed from only three posterior electrodes over the stroke-affected hemisphere. Its predictive accuracy (three electrodes) was higher than that of any &quot;global&quot; QEEG measure (averaged over 19 electrodes). These results may signify association between poststroke alpha slowing and cognitive impairment, which may be mediated by attentional (dys)function, which warrants further investigation. Pending further studies, QEEG measure(s)-from a few electrodes-could inform early prognostication of poststroke cognitive outcomes (and clinical decisions), particularly when cognitive function cannot be adequately assessed (due to symptoms, language, or other issues) or when assessment is equivocal."

The DR patients underwent laboratory tests. All individuals underwent a neuropsychological test. The differences in the ALFF values between the two groups were compared. The relationships between ALFF values and clinical measurements were analysed using a multiple-factor analysis.RESULTS: Compared to the controls, the DR group showed significantly increased ALFF values in the bilateral occipital gyrus, right lingual gyrus, and precuneus, and decreased values in the right posterior/anterior cerebellar lobe and the parahippocampal, fusiform, superior temporal, inferior parietal, and angular gyrus. Furthermore, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores were negatively correlated with decreased ALFF values in the right occipital lobe of the DR group, while increased ALFF values in the right precuneus and lingual gyrus were found to be positively correlated with glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with DR showed spontaneous cerebral activity abnormalities in many cerebral regions that were associated with cognitive impairments. HbA1c levels altered spontaneous cerebral activity in DR patients."
"29801885","Clinical and radiological determinants of transient symptoms associated with infarction (TSI).","BACKGROUND: The definition of transient ischemic attack was traditionally based on clinical features only.

"29538217","Correlation between acute stroke-induced white matter lesions and insulin resistance.","The present study was to examine the relationship between white matter lesions (WMLs) and insulin resistance (IR) in patients with acute stroke and evaluate clinical prognosis.Around 200 patients with initial onset of acute stroke including 146 patients (73.0%) with WMLs and 54 patients (27%) without WMLs were analyzed by neuropsychological scales. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin, blood lipid, homocysteine (Hcy), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), creatinine, and uric acid, diabetes mellitus (DM), prediabetes (PD), and normal glucose (NG) were determined according to HbA1c levels. According to homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-IR index of IR, HOMA-IR index =2.5 indicated IR, and HOMA-IR index<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>2.5 represented noninsulin resistance (NON-IR).IR values and the proportion of patients with IR, HbA1c levels and the quantity of DM patients, the levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, Hcy, and hs-CRP of patients with WMLs were significantly higher than those in patients without WMLs (all P<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>.05). OR value of IR exposure and WMLs was 1.862 (1.235-2.236). OR values of level 1, level 2, and level 3 WMLs were 1.632 (1.032-2.532), 1.328 (1.152-2.865), and 1.158 (0.639-3.526), respectively. Regarding WMLs patients, MoCA and MMSE scores were significantly decreased, and Hamilton Depression Scale scores were significantly increased (all P<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>.05). National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin scale scores of patients with WMLs were significantly increased, and BI scores were significantly decreased (all P<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>.05).IR is intimately correlated with the WMLs of acute stroke. The incidence and severity of WMLs are significantly associated with cerebral arterial thrombosis, neuropsychology, and neurological scores."
