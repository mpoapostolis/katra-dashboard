"24903316","Feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of early mood screening to diagnose persisting clinical depression/anxiety disorder after stroke.","BACKGROUND: Depression/anxiety disorders are common after stroke and have a negative impact on outcomes. Guidelines recommend that all stroke survivors are screened for these problems. However, there is no consensus on timing or method of assessment. We investigated the feasibility and accuracy of a very early screening strategy and the diagnostic accuracy this has for depression/anxiety disorders at 1 month.METHODS: Screening tools were Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Depression Intensity Scale Circles (DISCs); we also assessed cognition using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Screening was offered to sequential stroke admissions. At 1 month we assessed for clinical depression/anxiety disorder using Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and retested screening tools. We described test accuracy of acute depression/anxiety screening for clinical diagnosis of depression/anxiety disorder at 1 month and described temporal change in screening test scores. We assessed feasibility by describing proportions that were able, agreed to and completed the screening tests.RESULTS: Over 4 months, 102/146 admissions were suitable for screening following initial medical assessment, 69 (68%) agreed to screening, of whom 33 (48%) required researcher assistance to complete the screening test battery. Median time to assessment was 2 days (IQR: 1-4). Early HADS suggested n = 9 (13%) with depression; DISCs n = 25 (37%). Median acute MoCA was 21/30. At 1 month, n = 61 (88%) provided data. Repeat scores showed improvement over time; HADS (anxiety) mean difference: 2.5 (95% CI: 1.2-3.7), HADS (depression) mean difference: 1.6 (95% CI: 0.3-2.9). MINI defined n = 12 (20%) with depression and n = 6 (10%) with anxiety disorder. Comparing baseline screening to 1-month clinical diagnosis, HADS sensitivity was 0.25 (95% CI: 0.09-0.53) and specificity 0.94 (95% CI: 0.84-0.98); DISCs sensitivity was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.65-0.99) and specificity 0.78 (95% CI: 0.64-0.87).CONCLUSIONS: Even amongst 'medically stable' stroke patients, depression/anxiety screening at the acute stage may not be feasible or accurate. Half of participants required assistance from the researcher to complete assessments. The poor predictive accuracy of HADS for depression/anxiety disorder at 1 month may be due in part to the high prevalence of cognitive impairment in our sample. Screening in the first few days after stroke does not appear useful for detecting clinically important and sustained depression/anxiety problems."
"24876438","Autonomy of patients with type 2 diabetes with an insulin pump device: is it predictable?","BACKGROUND: Insulin pump therapy may be offered to patients with type 2 diabetes that is not controlled by multiple daily injections. Patients with type 2 diabetes may suffer from unrecognized cognitive disabilities, which may compromise the use of a pump device.METHODS: To predict patient autonomy, we evaluated 39 patients with type 2 diabetes from our database (n = 143) after continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) initiation using (1) an autonomy questionnaire evaluating the patient's cognitive and operative capacities for CSII utilization, (2) the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) for the detection of mild cognitive disabilities, (3) the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) for the detection of anxiety and depression, and (4) the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ). Patients were selected to constitute 3 groups matched for age, with different degrees of autonomy at discharge after the initial training program: complete (n = 13), partial (n = 13), or no autonomy (n = 13).RESULTS: The satisfaction level with the pump device was high. At the last follow-up visit, only 23% of patients did not reach complete autonomy. The autonomy score correlated fairly with the MOCA score (R = 0.771, P &lt; .001). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that at a cut-off score of 24, the MOCA identified autonomous versus dependent patients at long-term follow-up (area under the ROC curve [AUC], 0.893; sensitivity, 81%; specificity, 81%). The HADS correlated negatively with the autonomy score, and the sociocultural level also influenced autonomy with pump utilization.CONCLUSION: Patients with type 2 diabetes with partial autonomy at discharge may progress to complete autonomy. The MOCA and HADS may help predict a patient's ability to manage with a pump device."
"26136184","Epilepsy in patients with primary brain tumors: The impact on mood, cognition, and HRQOL.","BACKGROUND: A primary brain tumor (PBT) is often a fatal disease of the nervous system and has a serious impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Presence of epilepsy and adverse reactions from tumor and epilepsy treatments may cause additional decline in HRQOL.OBJECTIVES: We aimed to study the impact of epileptic seizures on cognition, mood, and HRQOL in patients with brain tumor-related epilepsy.MATERIALS AND METHOD: Patients were grouped on an ordinal scale according to epilepsy burden from none to severe based on the presence of epileptic seizures and seizure frequency: L1, no epilepsy; L2, with epilepsy, seizure-free in the last 6 months with antiepileptic drugs; and L3, with epilepsy, at least one seizure in the last 6 months with AEDs. Health-related quality of life was measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br) and Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31 (QOLIE-31) tools, cognition by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) tool and Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), mood by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), activities of daily living (ADLs) by the Barthel Index (BI), and performance status by the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) scale in patients with primary brain tumors at least one month following neurosurgery with or without radiotherapy and chemotherapy.RESULTS: Eighty-one patients with a diagnosis of primary brain tumors were recruited. Sixty-eight percent of patients were diagnosed with primary brain tumor-related epilepsy, 50.61% patients had cognitive impairment, 33% had abnormal scores in the anxiety scale, and 34% had abnormal scores in the depression scale. There were no statistically significant differences in these scores among L1, L2, and L3 groups. There were statistically significant differences in duration of disease and KPS and BI scores between L1 and L3 groups. The L3 group has significantly longer duration of disease and scored low in both the BI and KPS scale when compared to the L1 group. All patients with primary brain tumors scored significantly low in FACT-Br 'physical well-being' (PWB) and 'emotional well-being' (EWB) and high in 'social well-being' (SWB) when compared to healthy controls. When scores of each group were individually compared to healthy controls, the L3 group showed the lowest scores in PWB, EWB, and 'functional well-being'. In SWB, L1 and L2 groups showed statistically significantly high scores when compared to normative data. The QOLIE-31 applied to groups with epilepsy showed statistically significantly lower scores in the L3 group when compared to the L2 group in 'cognitive' and 'social functioning' domains. On multivariate analysis, both poor performance status and frequency of seizures were found to be independent risk factors for poor HRQOL when FACT-Br mean scores were compared. Level of seizures was found to be an independent risk factor for poor HRQOL when QOLIE-31 scores were compared between L2 and L3 groups.DISCUSSION: Presence of brain tumors could be attributed to cognitive impairment irrespective of the presence of epilepsy in our cohort. High seizure burden is an independent risk factor for poor HRQOL in patients with primary brain tumors. The QOLIE-31 is a more sensitive tool than the FACT-Br because of the presence of a seizure-related questionnaire."
"26099337","Cognitive impairment in relation to depression, anxiety and virological response in hepatitis C patients in Egypt.","OBJECTIVE: Cognitive impairment commonly occurs in hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence and sociodemographic and clinical correlates of cognitive impairment in HCV patients before and after 12 weeks of interferon treatment in comparison with a control group.METHODS: Hundred and sixteen consecutive HCV patients were included in the study and divided into treated and untreated groups. All patients were assessed using sociodemographic and clinical questionnaire, Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MOCA) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) before and after 12 weeks of treatment or observation.RESULTS: Thirty-eight percent of treated patients showed cognitive impairment at baseline, which increased to 69% after 12 weeks of interferon treatment. This cognitive impairment was reflected in the total MOCA score and in visuo-constructional skills, attention, concentration, working memory, language, and short-term memory, which was not shown by untreated group after 12 weeks of observation. Cognitive impairment was associated with low education, but not with depression, anxiety, or virological response.CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairment is common in HCV patients and increases significantly after interferon treatment. It is not related to depression or anxiety in HCV patients. Future research should focus on prevention, treatment and outcome of cognitive impairment in HCV patients, particularly those receiving interferon therapy."
"25639837","Depression, anxiety, and cognitive functioning after intracerebral hemorrhage.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Post-stroke depression (PSD) is an important complication of stroke. We studied long-term PSD after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) at young age, as well as anxiety, and cognitive functioning of the survivors.METHODS: We gathered clinical and imaging data of 336 young ICH patients between age 16 and 49 treated in the Helsinki University Central Hospital. After a median follow-up of 9.7 (7.0-12.0) years, we interviewed 130 survivors with structural questionnaires including Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale (PASS), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with PSD (BDI-II score &gt;13). Degree of disability was measured by modified Rankin Scale score (mRS).RESULTS: PSD was present among 30 (23.1%) and anxiety among 52 (40.0%) patients (HADS score &gt;6). Higher degree of disability was associated with symptoms of depression (higher BDI-II scores, P = 0.001), emotional distress (higher HADS scores, P = 0.004), and pain (higher PASS scores, P = 0.008, and higher BPI scores, P = 0.003). The only baseline factor identified to associate with PSD was hydrocephalus (P = 0.014). Median PASS score was 9 (IQR 0-25), median BPI score was 5 (0-23), and median MoCA score was 26 (22-28) hinting to normal or mild cognitive dysfunction. Antidepressants were used by 9.2%.CONCLUSIONS: One of four survivors of ICH at young age suffers long-term PSD. Higher degree of disability predicted occurrence of PSD. Treatment of depression appears as an unmet need in young ICH survivors."

"26978498","[Clinical experience of the use of agomelatine in the treatment of patients with depression and chronic brain ischemia].","OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy and tolerability of agomelatine (valdoxan) in treatment of mild depressive states in patients with chronic brain ischemia (CBI).MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprised 33 patients (23 women, 10 men, average age 54.5 years), including 12 people (36.4%) with CBI, stage I, and 21 (63.6%) with CBI, stage II. All patients had a single depressive episode of mild severity. Diagnosis of affective and cognitive impairment was carried out using clinical and neuropsychological methods (the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the night sleep questionnaire developed by A.M. Vein, the Mini-mental state examination (MMSE), the modified Mini-Cog method, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA), the Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI-S, CGI-I) to assess the degree and dynamics of the disease, the Patient Global Impression (PGI) scale. The survey had been performed after 2,4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Agomelatine (valdoxan) was used 1 time per day in the evening in a dose of 25 mg (1 tablet).RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Agomelatine improved sleep from the second week of treatment, reduced anxiety symptoms after six weeks and depressive symptoms after eight weeks. The improvement of cognitive functions was noted as well. No side-effects was observed. The results revealed the high antidepressive activity of the drug in treatment of mild depressive states in patients with chronic brain ischemia, the balanced spectrum of effects on anxiety, depression, insomnia, the positive effect on cognitive functions that allows to recommend agomelatine in treatment of patients with CBI."

The results demonstrated that the patients from the group of CSII therapy have had less signs and symptoms of neuropathy, cognitive disorders and better emotional condition than the patients from the group of basal-bolus therapy."
"27443241","Deep brain stimulation for patients with Parkinson's disease: Effect on caregiver burden.","INTRODUCTION: Our aim is to assess the burden on caregivers of patients with Parkinson's disease treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS) compared to those caring for patients at advanced stages and undergoing other treatments. We have also assessed the variables associated with presence of caregiver overload.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We included consecutive patients with Parkinson's disease treated with DBS. Our control group included patients in advanced stages of Parkinson's disease undergoing other treatments. Patients were assessed with the following scales: UPDRS-II, UPDRS-III, UPDRS-IV, Hoehn and Yahr, Schwab &amp; England, Barthel, PDQ-39, MoCA, Apathy Evaluation Scale, HADS, and the abbreviated QUIP. Caregiver burden was evaluated with the Zarit caregiver burden interview and their moods were assessed with the HADS scale.RESULTS: We included 11 patients treated with DBS and 11 with other treatments. For patients treated with DBS, we observed a better quality of life according to the PDQ-39 questionnaire (P=.028), and a lower score on the HADS anxiety subscale (P=.010). Caregiver overload was observed in 54.5% of the caregivers of patients in both groups (P=1.000); Zarit scores were similar (P=.835). Caregiver overload was associated with higher scores on the caregiver's Apathy Evaluation Scale (P=.048) and on the HADS anxiety subscale (P=.006).CONCLUSION: According to our results, treatment with DBS is not associated with lower caregiver burden. Apathy in patients and anxiety in caregivers are factors associated with the appearance of overload."

"29197202","Factor structure and cut-off scores of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) in a Croatian sample of adult patients suffering from advanced cancer.","BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer should be systematically screened for psychological problems at key points in their pathway. Usage of self-report scales for measuring anxiety and depression (such as Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS)) is a very practical methodfor detecting anxiety and depression. The aim of this research was to determine latent structure, reliability and cut-off scores of HADSin a Croatian sample of adult patients suffering from advanced metastatic cancer.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: According to inclusion and exclusion criteria, participant were recruited at University Hospital Centre Zagreb (N=46; January 2015) and Clinical Hospital Centre 'Sisters of Mercy' (N=29; April 2015). All participants underwent short structured psychodiagnostic interview, cognitive evaluation (usingMontreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test) and were given HADS.RESULTS: When using PCA separately for the items of each original scale of HADS, only four items for the component Depression satisfactorily saturate principal component and when using PCA for all the items, only seven items from the original scale satisfactorily saturate unique principal component. Maximum Likelihood extraction method showed that only four items from the original scale satisfactorily saturated the theoretical scales.CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the best solution to use HADS, in defined Croatian population, is as one-dimensional screening instrument (Cronbach's alpha coefficient of internal consistency=0.774) with cut-off score 11/12."
"28783374","HIV and Cognitive Impairment in Clinical Practice: The Evaluation of a Stepwise Screening Protocol in Relation to Clinical Outcomes and Management.","Neurocognitive impairment (NCI) is an increasingly important comorbidity in an ageing HIV+ population. Despite the lack of available treatment modalities, screening for NCI is recommended. In the UMC Utrecht, yearly NCI screening is done using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) tool and the HIV Dementia Scale (HDS). The aim of this study was to evaluate this screening protocol in relation to clinical outcomes and management. A retrospective cohort study was performed in suppressed adult HIV+ patients. Apart from the MoCa and the HDS, the Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation-Participation (USER-P) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were performed. Patients scoring below average on cognitive screening tests or with subjective cognitive complaints were further evaluated using a standardized protocol, including optimizing cART and checking for somatic disorders. In patients with cognitive complaints and participation restrictions, cognitive rehabilitation was proposed. Two hundred eighty-six patients were screened. The vast majority were MSM with an average age of 49 years. One hundred forty-four out of 286 patients (50%) had an abnormal test score and/or had subjective cognitive complaints. Restrictions in participation were present in 23% of patients. Six patients on Efavirenz switched their regimes, as this drug is known for its potential central nervous system (CNS) side effects. A depressive component was present in 58 patients (40%). Five patients had a clinical relevant laboratory abnormality. Moreover, six patients were referred for cognitive rehabilitation, which resulted in a 100% success rate in set goals in the five evaluable patients. Although the protocol was not fully adhered to in all patients, it did result in detectable underlying causes of NCI in 59% of patients, and 21% was referred for further treatment. Moreover, cognitive rehabilitation appears to be a very successful intervention for patients with NCI who experience subjective complaints and participation restrictions."
"29734988","Change in Cognition and Other Non-Motor Symptoms With Obstructive Sleep Apnea Treatment in Parkinson Disease.","STUDY OBJECTIVES: Parkinson disease (PD) non-motor symptoms are associated with sleep disorders and impair quality of life. Our objective was to assess the effect of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) treatment using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on PD non-motor symptoms.METHODS: In this prospective observational study, 67 patients with idiopathic PD underwent polysomnography. Those with moderate-severe OSA were offered CPAP therapy. Subjects were divided into those without OSA (OSA-), and those with OSA (OSA+). Analyses were conducted for 6 and 12 months' follow-up data. At 6 months, those who had used CPAP at home for at least 1 month were considered CPAP users (OSA+CPAP+), whereas those who did not try it, or declined further treatment following a short trial were considered non-users (OSA+CPAP-). For the 12-month analysis, only those still actively using CPAP at 12 months were included in the OSA+CPAP+ group. Non-motor symptom measurements were: Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part 1 (UPDRS1), Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS), Fatigue Severity Scale, Apathy Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).CONCLUSIONS: CPAP treatment of OSA in PD is associated with improved overall non-motor symptoms, sleep quality, anxiety, and global cognitive function over a 12-month period."
"29359732","[The efficacy of the exoskeleton ExoAtlet to restore walking in patients with multiple sclerosis].","AIM: To investigate the efficacy and safety of the exoskeleton ExoAtlet in complex therapy of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).MATERIAL AND METHODS: A pilot study within the prospective open controlled program was conducted. Eighteen patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) in remission and secondary progressive MS (SPMS) with the level of neurological deficit on the EDSS from 3 to 7 points have completed the study. EDSS, MSFC, HADS, MoCA scales were administered and the force measuring insoles F-Scan Tekscan (USA) were used to study the biomechanics of walking.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Good tolerability of workload within 30-40 min. was observed. The improvement in the EDSS was detected in 9 patients, in whole, a significant positive trend (p&lt;0.01) was shown. The study of the biomechanics of the walk showed its significant impairment compared to healthy individuals: reduction of parameters of rate, speed and step length, significant instability, pronounced asymmetry, the decrease in support and shock lower limb function, high coefficient of variability of the parameters, the phenomenon of recurrence of the vertical component of support reactions. After a course of exercise of walking in the exoskeleton, the walking speed and stability increased, oscillation of the body decreased, support function increased, the phenomenon of cyclical changes of the vertical component of support reactions reduced. The results of the pilot study showed promising future research opportunities for robotic-assisted walking and maintenance of the vertical posture with the help of the exoskeleton ExoAtlet to restore the abilities of movement in MS patients with locomotor disorders."
