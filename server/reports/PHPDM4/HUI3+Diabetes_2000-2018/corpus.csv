"14675484","Health-related quality of life deficits associated with varying degrees of disease severity in type 2 diabetes.","BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a chronic medical condition accompanied by a considerable health-related quality of life (HRQL) burden. The purpose of this analysis was to use generic measures of HRQL to describe HRQL deficits associated with varying degrees of severity of type 2 diabetes.METHODS: The RAND-12 physical and mental health composites (PHC and MHC, respectively) and Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) were self-completed by 372 subjects enrolled in a prospective, controlled study of an intervention to improve care for individuals with type 2 diabetes in rural communities. Analysis of covariance was used to assess differences in HRQL according to disease severity and control of blood glucose. Disease severity was defined in terms of treatment intensity, emergency room visits and absenteeism from work specifically attributable to diabetes. To control for potential confounding, the analysis was adjusted for important sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.RESULTS: The PHC and MHC were significantly lower for individuals treated with insulin as compared to diet alone (PHC: 41.01 vs 45.11, MHC: 43.23 vs 47.00, p &lt; 0.05). Individuals treated with insulin had lower scores on the vision, emotion and pain attributes of the HUI3 than individuals managed with oral medication or diet. The PHC, MHC, pain attribute and overall score on the HUI3 captured substantial decrements in HRQL associated with absenteeism from work due to diabetes, while the burden associated with emergency room utilization for diabetes was seen in the PHC and HUI3 pain attribute.CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that generic measures of HRQL captured deficits associated with more severe disease in type 2 diabetes."
"14672109","A comparison of the health utilities indices Mark 2 and Mark 3 in type 2 diabetes.","PURPOSE: Past research into health-related quality of life (HRQL) in diabetes using preference-based measures, such as the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI2) or the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3), is sparse. Important differences between the HUI2 and HUI3 could lead to differences in their abilities to capture HRQL deficits in type 2 diabetes. This analysis compared the extent to which the HUI2 and HUI3 detect differences associated with varying levels of disease severity or advancement in type 2 diabetes. METHODS. This analysis was conducted as part of using baseline, cross-sectional data from a larger, prospective, controlled study of an intervention to improve care for individuals with type 2 diabetes in rural communities in Alberta, Canada. The HU12 and HUI3 were self-administered to 372 community-dwelling individuals with type 2 diabetes.RESULTS: Relative to HUI2 scores, larger differences in overall HUI3 scores were seen for comparisons for individuals presumed to have more advanced disease. The pain attribute of the HUI3 categorized a larger proportion of individuals as moderately to severely impaired (41.5% v. 24.2%, P &lt; 0.001), as did the emotion attribute (20.5% v. 7.7%, P &lt; 0.001). For individuals with negative overall HUI3 scores, differences between overall HUI2 and HUI3 scores persisted after rescaling (mean difference = 0.33, P = 0.009).CONCLUSIONS: The greater range of possible scores on the HUI3, its relative ability to assess the utility of states worse than dead, and its relative superiority in discriminating moderate to severe impairment from mild or no impairment might favor its use over the HUI2 in type 2 diabetes."
"15161780","Improvements in patient-reported outcomes associated with an intervention to enhance quality of care for rural patients with type 2 diabetes: results of a controlled trial.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine patient-reported outcomes in a controlled trial of a multifaceted provider-level intervention to improve quality of care for rural patients with type 2 diabetes.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a before/after intervention study with concurrent controls in two rural regions in Alberta, Canada. The intervention consisted of six monthly visits by a multidisciplinary health care team and was primarily directed at primary care providers. Clinical and patient-reported outcomes were assessed after 6 months. Patient-reported outcomes included changes in health-related quality of life (Health Utilities Index Mark 3 [HUI3]), satisfaction with care, lifestyle (Diabetes Lifestyle Form), and adherence to self-care activities. Analysis of covariance was used to assess differences over time between the control and intervention regions.RESULTS: A total of 200 intervention and 172 control subjects were included in this analysis. After adjusting for important clinical and demographic differences, a statistically significant and clinically important improvement in the overall HUI3 score was seen at the 6-month follow-up in the intervention region (0.06 [95% CI 0.02-0.10]) compared with the control region (0.01 [-0.04 to 0.04]) (P = 0.03 for the difference between groups). Satisfaction with general medical care (P &lt; 0.001 between groups) and diabetes care (P &lt; 0.001 between groups) increased among patients in the intervention region compared with the control region. Self-efficacy, attitudes, and beliefs about diabetes control all increased in the intervention region when compared with the control region, but adherence to self-care activities did not.CONCLUSIONS: A provider-level intervention directed at improving quality of clinical care for patients with type 2 diabetes also had a favorable impact on overall health-related quality of life, satisfaction with care, and other humanistic outcomes."
"15085916","Construct validity of the RAND-12 and Health Utilities Index Mark 2 and 3 in type 2 diabetes.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the cross-sectional construct validity of the RAND-12 and the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI2) and Mark 3 (HUI3) in type 2 diabetes.METHODS: Parametric tests were used to test for differences in HRQL scores between known groups with type 2 diabetes, defined in terms of treatment intensity, duration of diabetes and glycemic control.RESULTS: The PHC of the RAND-12 was significantly lower for individuals treated with insulin (40.28 +/- 10.97) than diet alone (45.18 +/- 12.02, p &lt; 0.01), as was the MHC (42.83 +/- 10.75 vs. 46.87 +/- 10.89, p &lt; 0.05). MHC (43.56 +/- 10.20 vs. 46.18 +/- 9.94, p &lt; 0.05) and PHC (41.04 +/- 10.64 vs. 45.62 +/- 10.48, p &lt; 0.001) were both lower for those with longer duration of diabetes. Overall HUI3 scores were lower in individuals above the median duration of diabetes (5.0 years) as compared to those with a shorter duration (0.60 +/- 0.29 vs. 0.67 +/- 0.29, p &lt; 0.01) and for individuals whose diabetes was managed using insulin compared to diet alone (0.59 +/- 0.30 vs. 0.69 +/- 0.30, p &lt; 0.05). Disease severity was associated with impairment on the ambulation, dexterity and pain attributes of the HUI3. Similar results were found for the HUI2. Overall HUI2 scores were highest for individuals managed with diet alone compared to those managed with insulin. Disease severity was associated with the mobility and self-care attributes of the HUI2. No relationship was found between any of the measures of HRQL and glycemic control.CONCLUSIONS: Scores for individuals presumed to have more severe or advanced disease were significantly lower for many comparisons using the RAND-12, HUI2 and HUI3. The results of this study contribute evidence of construct validity of the HUI2, HUI3 and RAND-12 in type 2 diabetes."
"15038828","Using linked data to calculate summary measures of population health: Health-adjusted life expectancy of people with Diabetes Mellitus.","OBJECTIVES: To estimate the health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE) from diabetes mellitus (DM) using a population health survey linked to a population-based DM registry. METHODS: The 1996/97 Ontario Health Survey (N = 35,517) was linked to the Ontario Diabetes Database (N = 487,576). The Health Utilities Index (HUI3) was used to estimate health-related quality of life. HALE was estimated using an adapted Sullivan method. RESULTS: Life expectancy at birth of people with DM was 64.7 and 70.7 years for men and women - 12.8 and 12.2 years less than for men and women without DM. The HUI3 was lower for physician-diagnosed DM compared to self-reported DM (0.799 versus 0.872). HALE at birth was 58.3 and 62.8 years for men and women - 11.9 and 10.7 years less than that of men and women without DM. CONCLUSIONS: The linked data approach demonstrates that DM is an important cause of disease burden. This approach reduces assumptions when estimating the prevalence and severity of disability from DM compared to methods that rely on self-reported disease status or indirect assessment of disability severity."
"16330290","Triple therapy with glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled by metformin and a thiazolidinedione: results of a 30-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.","OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus that was inadequately controlled with a combination of immediate- or extended-release metformin and a thiazolidinedione.METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 2-arm study consisting of a 4-week stabilization and eligibility period and a 26-week treatment period. Patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes for a minimum of 1 year received glimepiride (titrated sequentially from 2 to 4 to 8 mg/d over 6 weeks, followed by 20 weeks of maintenance therapy) or placebo in combination with an established regimen of immediate- or extended release metformin and rosiglitazone or pioglitazone. The primary efficacy outcome was the change in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) from baseline. The safety analysis was based on the incidence of hypo glycemia, adverse events, and laboratory abnormalities. Changes in lipid levels (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides) were evaluated, and health-related quality of life was assessed based on scores on the Diabetes Care Profile (DCP) and Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HU13).RESULTS: Of 170 randomized patients, 159 were included in the efficacy analysis and 168 were included in the safety analysis. Demographic variables were similar at baseline between the glimepiride and placebo groups (mean age, 56.5 and 56.4 years, respectively; percent men/women, 61.0%/39.0% and 62.3%/37.7%; weight, 100.9 and 96.3 kg). HbA(1c) was significantly improved at end point with glimepiride combination therapy compared with placebo (mean [SE], -1.31% [0.08] vs -0.33% [0.08], respectively; P &lt; 0.001). The majority of patients (62.2%) who received glimepiride achieved an HbA(1c) value of &lt; or =7%, compared with 26.0% of patients receiving placebo (P &lt; 0.001 between groups). At end point, the adjusted mean differences between treatments significantly favored the glimepiride combination in terms of fasting plasma glucose (-37.4 [4.0] mg/dL; P &lt; 0.001), fasting insulin (4.06 [1.69] microIU/mL; P &lt; 0.03), and C-peptide (124.5 [35.9] pmol/L; P &lt; 0.001). The adjusted mean changes in body mass index from baseline to end point were 1.26 (0.16) kg/m(2) with glimepiride and 0.17 (0.16) kg/m(2) with placebo (P &lt; 0.001). Similarly, the mean change in weight was greater with glimepiride than with placebo (3.76 [0.54] vs 0.45 [0.52] kg; P &lt; 0.001). There were no significant differences in lipid levels between groups. Clinically significant adverse events, laboratory abnormalities, and rates of severe hypoglycemia were similar between treatment groups. The overall incidence of hypoglycemia, however, was 51.2% in the glimepiride group and 8.3% in the placebo group (P &lt; 0.001). In general, there was no significant difference between treatment groups with respect to scores on the DCP or HUI3 over the study period.CONCLUSIONS: In these patients with type 2 diabetes that was not adequately controlled by dual combination therapy with metformin and a thiazolidinedione, the addition of glimepiride improved glycemic control compared with placebo with an acceptable tolerability profile. Although there were significantly more episodes of hypoglycemia with triple therapy than with dual therapy and placebo, the risk for severe hypoglycemia was low."
"16133651","Health-related quality of life measurements in elderly Canadians with osteoporosis compared to other chronic medical conditions: a population-based study from the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMos).","The objective of this research was to determine the relative decrement in health-related quality of life, as measured by the health utilities index mark 3 (HUI3), in osteoporosis compared to other chronic medical conditions. The impact of chronic medical conditions other than osteoporosis on HUI3 measurements had been previously established in the 1996/1997 Canadian National Population Health Survey (NPHS). The Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMos) is a national population-based study in which regional participants were randomly recruited, regardless of presence of osteoporosis. We analyzed data from participants aged &gt; or = 65 years who completed a baseline HUI3 questionnaire and provided information on their medical history (n=3,750). We determined the age- and gender-adjusted mean decrement in HUI3 for several chronic medical conditions, including osteoporosis. The mean changes in HUI3 adjusted for age and gender (with 95% confidence intervals) were as follows: arthritis -0.10 (-0.11, -0.09), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) -0.07 (-0.09, -0.05), diabetes mellitus -0.05 (-0.08, -0.03), heart disease -0.06 (-0.08, -0.04), hypertension -0.02 (-0.03, -0.01), and osteoporosis -0.08 (-0.11, -0.06), respectively (model r2=0.17; P&lt;0.0001). These findings were comparable to those observed in the NPHS, with the exception of osteoporosis, which had not been previously studied in this fashion. The decrement in HUI3 score seen in participants with osteoporosis was comparable to that observed in other chronic medical conditions, such as arthritis, COPD, diabetes mellitus or heart disease."
"16047506","Health-related quality of life deficits associated with diabetes and comorbidities in a Canadian National Population Health Survey.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of comorbid heart disease, stroke and arthritis on health-related quality of life (HRQL) in people with diabetes in the general Canadian population.METHODS: Data were collected as part of the 1996-1997 Canadian National Population Health Survey. HRQL was assessed using overall Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) and single attribute utility scores. Respondents (N = 66,093) were classified into 1 of 16 groups based on the presence or absence of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and arthritis, in all possible combinations and HRQL scores were compared using analysis of covariance.RESULTS: Overall HUI3 scores for respondents with diabetes alone (0.88, 95% CI: 0.87-0.89) were lower than controls (0.92: 95% CI: 0.92-0.92, p &lt; 0.001). Overall HUI3 scores for diabetes in combination with heart disease (0.77, 95% CI: 0.74-0.79), arthritis (0.78, 95% CI: 0.77-0.79) or stroke (0.79, 95% CI: 0.74-0.85) were considerably lower than diabetes alone. Triplets of comorbidities were associated with overall HRQL deficits of approximately 0.26-0.30, relative to controls.CONCLUSIONS: The illness burden experienced by individuals with diabetes is not only associated with diabetes itself, but largely with comorbid medical conditions."
"16967751","Aboriginal participation in the DOVE study.","BACKGROUND: Aboriginals constitute a substantial portion of the population of Northern Alberta. Determinants such as poverty and education can compound health-care accessibility barriers experienced by Aboriginals compared to non-Aboriginals. A diabetes care enhancement study involved the collection of baseline and follow-up data on Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients with known type 2 diabetes in two rural communities in Northern Alberta. Analyses were conducted to determine any demographic or clinical differences existing between Aboriginals and non-Aboriginals.METHODS: 394 diabetes patients were recruited from the Peace and Keeweetinok Lakes health regions. 354 self-reported whether or not they were Aboriginal; a total of 94 self-reported being Aboriginal. Baseline and follow-up data were collected through interviews, standardized physical assessments, laboratory testing and self-reporting questionnaires (RAND-12 and HUI3).RESULTS: Aboriginals were younger, with longer duration of diabetes, more likely to be female, and less likely to have completed high school. At baseline, self-reported health status was uniformly worse, but the differences disappeared with adjustments for sociodemographic confounders, except for perceived mental health status. Aboriginals considered their mental health status to be worse than non-Aboriginals at baseline. Some aspects of health utilization were also different.DISCUSSION: While demographics were different and some utilization differences existed, overall this analysis demonstrates that &quot;Aboriginality&quot; does not contribute to diabetes outcomes when adjusted for appropriate variables."
"16632135","Health Utilities Index mark 3 demonstrated construct validity in a population-based sample with type 2 diabetes.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the cross-sectional construct validity of the Health Utilities Index mark 3 (HUI3) in type 2 diabetes using population health survey data.STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Data used were from 5,134 adult respondents of Cycle 1.1 (2000-2001) of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) with type 2 diabetes. Analyses of covariance models were used to assess differences in overall and single-attribute HUI3 scores between groups hypothesized a priori to differ in HRQL. The association between health-care resource use (i.e., hospitalizations and physician and emergency room visits) and overall HUI3 scores was assessed using logistic regression models.RESULTS: For overall HUI3 scores, clinically important and statistically significant differences were observed between all groups expected to differ in HRQL. Depression was the comorbidity associated with the largest deficit (-0.17; 95% confidence interval CI=-0.22, -0.12), followed by stroke (-0.15; 95% CI=-0.21, -0.10) and heart disease (-0.08; 95% CI=-0.11, -0.05). Insulin use and comorbidities were associated with clinically important deficits in pain. Overall HUI3 scores were significantly predictive of all three categories of health-care resource use.CONCLUSION: Observed differences between groups contribute further evidence of the construct validity of the HUI3 in type 2 diabetes."
"16542446","Misinterpretation with norm-based scoring of health status in adults with type 1 diabetes.","BACKGROUND: Interpretations of profile and preference based measure scores can differ. Profile measures often use a norm-based scoring algorithm where each scale is scored to have a standardized mean and standard deviation, relative to the general population scores/norms (i.e., norm-based). Preference-based index measures generate an overall scores on the conventional scale in which 0.00 is assigned to dead and 1.00 is assigned to perfect health. Our objective was to investigate the interpretation of norm-based scoring of generic health status measures in a population of adults with type 1 diabetes by comparing norm-based health status scores and preference-based health-related quality of life (HRQL) scores.METHODS: Data were collected through self-complete questionnaires sent to patients with type 1 diabetes. The RAND-36 and the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) were included.RESULTS: A total of 216 (61%) questionnaires were returned. The respondent sample was predominantly female (58.8%); had a mean (SD) age of 37.1 (14.3) years and a mean duration of diabetes of 20.9 (12.4) years. Mean (SD) health status scores were: RAND-36 PHC 47.9 (9.4), RAND-36 MHC 47.2 (11.8), and HUI3 0.78 (0.23). Histograms of these scores show substantial left skew. HUI3 scores were similar to those previously reported for diabetes in the general Canadian population. Physical and mental health summary scores of the RAND-36 suggest that this population is as healthy as the general adult population.CONCLUSION: In this sample, a preference-based measure indicated poorer health, consistent with clinical evidence, whereas a norm-based measure indicated health similar to the average for the general population. Norm-based scoring measure may provide misleading interpretations in populations when health status is not normally distributed."
"17446823","Health-related quality of life consequences of implantable cardioverter defibrillators: results from MADIT II.","BACKGROUND: Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) improve survival and extend lives of patients with severe heart disease.OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the impact of ICDs on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) during the first 3 years after implantation.SUBJECTS: A total of 1089 patients from the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial II (MADIT II) were randomized to an ICD or medical treatment only.MEASURES: Health Utility Index (HUI3) at baseline, 3, 12, 24, and 36 months following randomization; survival data.RESEARCH DESIGN: We constructed mean profiles of HRQOL for living patients, estimated overall quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), separately by treatment arm, and calculated cumulative QALY gains/losses as the difference between the areas under the treatment specific HRQOL profiles. Multivariate fixed effect regression models were developed to impute the missing HRQOL data using baseline patient characteristics (age, gender, treatment, HUI3 score, diabetes, diuretics use, and NYHA class). Bootstrapped standard errors were calculated for the estimated differences in HRQOL gains/losses between treatment arms. Similarly, we performed subgroup analyses (by gender, age, and baseline NYHA class, blood urine nitrogen, ejection fraction, and QRS).RESULTS: There were no differences in QALYs loss for living patients by treatment group (-0.037, P = 0.64) or in overall QALYs loss by treatment group (0.043, P = 0.37) over 3 years. In subgroup analysis, female subjects demonstrated a trend towards greater survival benefit (0.298, P = 0.07) and overall QALYs (0.261, P = 0.14).CONCLUSIONS: Adverse effects of the ICD on HRQOL together with lower HRQOL among survivors may offset the 3-year survival benefits of ICDs."
"19067006","Importance of sociodemographic and morbidity aspects in measuring health-related quality of life: performances of three tools: comparison of three questionnaire scores.","BACKGROUND: Since health-related quality of life (HRQL) measures are numerous, comparisons have been suggested.AIM: To compare three HRQL measures: SF6D, HUI3 and EQ5D.METHODS: Three questionnaires (SF36, HUI3, EQ5D) were administered to 1,011 patients attending 16 general practices in two Italian cities. Information about patients' gender, age, education, marital status, smoking, body mass index (BMI) and chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal diseases) were also collected. Questionnaires scores were calculated using the appropriate algorithms; in particular SF6D scores were obtained from SF36 items. Agreement and correlation between questionnaires scores were investigated using Bland and Altman method and Spearman coefficient. The influence of socio-demographic and morbidity indicators on scores was analysed using the nonparametric quantile regression.RESULTS: The Spearman coefficient was about 0.6 for all questionnaires. The 95% limits of agreement of the scores were approximately from -0.5 to 0.3 except for SF6D and EQ5D when they were from -0.4 to 0.2. The measures were influenced by socio-demographic and clinical variables in a similar way, especially SF6D (the index obtained from SF36) and EQ5D, which appeared to be influenced by the same pattern of factors, including gender, chronic diseases, smoking and BMI.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the agreement between questionnaires scores was quite low, whilst the correlation level was good. Questionnaire scores were influenced by socio-demographic and clinical variables in a similar way, especially SF6D and EQ5D. Therefore, the descriptive capacity of SF6D and EQ5D was found to be similar."
"22515638","Baseline comparison of three health utility measures and the feeling thermometer among participants in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes trial.","BACKGROUND: Health utility (HU) measures are used as overall measures of quality of life and to determine quality adjusted life years (QALYs) in economic analyses. We compared baseline values of three HUs including Short Form 6 Dimensions (SF-6D), and Health Utilities Index, Mark II and Mark III (HUI2 and HUI3) and the feeling thermometer (FT) among type 2 diabetes participants in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial. We assessed relationships between HU and FT values and patient demographics and clinical variables.METHODS: ACCORD was a randomized clinical trial to test if intensive controls of glucose, blood pressure and lipids can reduce the risk of major cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in type 2 diabetes patients with high risk of CVD. The health-related quality of life (HRQOL) sub-study includes 2,053 randomly selected participants. Interclass correlations (ICCs) and agreement between measures by quartile were used to evaluate relationships between HU's and the FT. Multivariable regression models specified relationships between patient variables and each HU and the FT.RESULTS: The ICCs were 0.245 for FT/SF-6D, 0.313 for HUI3/SF-6D, 0.437 for HUI2/SF-6D, 0.338 for FT/HUI2, 0.337 for FT/HUI3 and 0.751 for HUI2/HUI3 (P <U+2009>&lt; <U+2009>0.001 for all). Common classification by quartile was found for the majority (62%) of values between HUI2 and HUI3, which was significantly (P <U+2009>&lt;<U+2009> 0.001) higher than between other HUs and the FT: SF-6D/HUI3 <U+2009>=<U+2009> 40.8%, SF-6D/HUI2<U+2009> =<U+2009> 40.9%, FT/HUI3 <U+2009>= <U+2009>35.0%, FT/HUI2 <U+2009>=<U+2009> 34.9%, and FT/SF-6D <U+2009>=<U+2009> 31.9%. Common classification was higher between SF-6D/HUI2 and SF-6D/HUI3 (P <U+2009>&lt; <U+2009>0.001) than between FT/SF-6D, FT/HUI2, and FT/HUI3. The mean difference in HU values per patient ranged from -0.024 <U+2009>± <U+2009>0.225 for SF-6D/ HUI3 to -0.124<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.133 for SF-6D/HUI2. Regression models were significant; clinical and demographic variables explained 6.1% (SF-6D) to 7.7% (HUI3) of the variance in HUs.CONCLUSIONS: The agreements between the different HUs were poor except for the two HUI measures; therefore HU values derived different measures may not be comparable. The FT had low agreement with HUs. The relationships between HUs and demographic and clinical measures demonstrate how severity of diabetes and other clinical and demographic factors are associated with HUs and FT measures.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00000620."
"26013567","Diabetes and quality of life: Comparing results from utility instruments and Diabetes-39.","OBJECTIVE: To compare the Diabetes-39 (D-39) with six multi-attribute utility (MAU) instruments (15D, AQoL-8D, EQ-5D, HUI3, QWB, and SF-6D), and to develop mapping algorithms which could be used to transform the D-39 scores into the MAU scores.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Self-reported diabetes sufferers (N=924) and members of the healthy public (N=1760), aged 18 years and over, were recruited from 6 countries (Australia 18%, USA 18%, UK 17%, Canada 16%, Norway 16%, and Germany 15%). Apart from the QWB which was distributed normally, non-parametric rank tests were used to compare subgroup utilities and D-39 scores. Mapping algorithms were estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS) and generalised linear models (GLM).RESULTS: MAU instruments discriminated between diabetes patients and the healthy public; however, utilities varied between instruments. The 15D, SF-6D, AQoL-8D had the strongest correlations with the D-39. Except for the HUI3, there were significant differences by gender. Mapping algorithms based on the OLS estimator consistently gave better goodness-of-fit results. The mean absolute error (MAE) values ranged from 0.061 to 0.147, the root mean square error (RMSE) values 0.083 to 0.198, and the R-square statistics 0.428 and 0.610. Based on MAE and RMSE values the preferred mapping is D-39 into 15D. R-square statistics and the range of predicted utilities indicate the preferred mapping is D-39 into AQoL-8D.CONCLUSIONS: Utilities estimated from different MAU instruments differ significantly and the outcome of a study could depend upon the instrument used. The algorithms reported in this paper enable D-39 data to be mapped into utilities predicted from any of six instruments. This provides choice for those conducting cost-utility analyses."
"27028282","Impact of intensive lifestyle intervention on preference-based quality of life in type 2 diabetes: Results from the Look AHEAD trial.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) compared with standard diabetes support and education (DSE) on preference-based health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in persons with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes.METHODS: Look AHEAD was a multisite, randomized trial of 5,145 participants assigned to ILI or DSE. Four instruments were administered during the trial: Feeling Thermometer (FT), Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI2), Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3), and Short Form 6D (SF-6D). Linear mixed effect models were used to estimate the mean difference in preference scores by treatment group for 9 years.RESULTS: The ILI had higher mean FT (0.019, 95% CI, 0.015-0.024, P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) and SF-6D (0.011, 95% CI, 0.006-0.014, P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) scores than the DSE. No significant group differences were observed for the HUI2 (0.004, 95% CI, -0.003 to 0.010, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.23) and HUI3 (0.004, -0.004 to 0.012, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.36). In year 1, the ILI had higher mean preference scores for all instruments. Thereafter, the increases remained significant only for FT and SF-6D, and the effects also become smaller.CONCLUSIONS: ILI aimed at reducing body weight among persons with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes improves preference-based HRQOL in the short term, but its long-term effect is unclear."
