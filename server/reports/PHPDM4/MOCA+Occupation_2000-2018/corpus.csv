"24415644","Cognitive function and plasma BDNF levels among manganese-exposed smelters.","OBJECTIVES: To explore the potential dose-response relationship between manganese (Mn) exposure and cognitive function and also plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in occupational Mn exposure workers.METHODS: A total 819 workers were identified from our Mn-exposed workers, and 293 control workers were recruited in the same region. All exposed workers were divided into three groups based on Mn cumulative exposure index. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test was applied to estimate cognitive function for all subjects. Plasma BDNF levels were determined by ELISA in 248 selected exposed workers and 100 controls.RESULTS: Mn-exposed workers had significantly lower MoCA scores than those in the control group (25.62 ± 0.25): those in high-exposure group had the lowest scores (21.33 ± 0.32), compared with the intermediate-exposure group (23.22 ± 0.30) and low-exposure group (23.57 ± 0.23). Mn exposure levels were inversely associated with MoCA total scores, all p&lt;0.05. A positive correlation was found between plasma BDNF levels and MoCA total scores (r=0.278, p&lt;0.01). Moreover, compared with the control group (288.7 ± 181.7 pg/mL), BDNF levels were lower in the high-exposure group (127.5 ± 99.8 pg/mL), and in the intermediate-exposure (178.2 ± 138.1 pg/mL) and low-exposure groups (223.4 ± 178.3 pg/mL). Additionally, plasma BDNF levels decreased significantly as Mn exposure levels increased (ptrend&lt;0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Mn exposure may be associated with decreased plasma BDNF levels and cognition impairment in this large cross-sectional study."

Patients older than 65 years old (odds ratio [OR] 4.88, confidence interval [CI] 1.79 - 13.28 p = 0.002) and with an education of primary level or below (OR 4.08, CI 1.30 - 12.81, p = 0.016) were independent risk factors for CI in multivariate analysis. Patients with PD-related peritonitis were significantly older (p &lt; 0.001) and more likely to have CI as defined by MoCA (p = 0.035). After adjustment for age, however, CI was not a significant independent risk factor for PD-related peritonitis among self-care PD patients (OR 2.20, CI 0.65 - 7.44, p = 0.20). When we compared patients with MoCA-defined CI receiving self-care and assisted PD, there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of age, MoCA scores, or comorbidities. There were also no statistically significant differences in 1-year outcome of PD-related peritonitis rates or exit-site infections. <U+2666></AbstractText>: The age of studied patients was 59±15.0 years, and 47% were female.

"25958706","The factors associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in surgical menopause women.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: As a sizeable proportion of persons with mild cognitive impairment will progress to frank dementia, early detection is an important strategy to prevent and decelerate the progression of cognitive decline. In Thailand, the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment in surgical menopause women has not been well established. The objectives of the present study were to determine the percentage and factors associated with mild cognitive impairment in women with surgical menopause.MATERIAL AND METHOD: Between October 2013 and July 2014, 200 eligible women at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital were enrolled. The self-reported questionnaires were used to obtain the demographic data and the Thai version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The MCI was diagnosed when the MoCA score was less than 25. The data were statistically analyzed using SPSS version 17 for student t-test, Chi-square test, and multiple regression analysis.RESULTS: The percentage of MCI in the present study was 43.5%. The univariate analysis showed that factors significantly related to MCI were marital status, educational levels, occupation, monthly income, and duration of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Nevertheless, multiple regression analysis revealed that only older age at enrollment, marital status, low educational level, and low monthly income were significantly related to MCI.CONCLUSION: Almost half of the surgical menopause women in the present study had MCI. Older age at enrollment, marital status, low educational level, and low monthly income were significantly related to MCI. Age at surgical menopause and HRT were not found to be associated with MCI in this study."

"26853687","Survey of cognitive rehabilitation practices in the state of Kuwait.","Background Rehabilitation professionals must be astute at recognizing, assessing, and treating individuals with cognitive deficits. No research is available to examine cognitive rehabilitation practices applied to individuals with neurological conditions in Kuwait.OBJECTIVES: To identify the use of cognitive assessments, the availability of resources, and the barriers to cognitive rehabilitation practices in Kuwait. Methods Face-to-face interviews were conducted with health care professionals working with adult individuals with neurological conditions. These professionals included occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, psychiatrists, and neurologists. Results The most commonly used cognitive based assessments are MMSE (41%), and MoCA and LOTCA (15.2%). The only clinical assessment used is the Line-Bisection Test (2.2%). The most used occupation-based assessments are FIM (6.5%), COPM (4.3%), the Interest Checklist (2.2%), and the Barthel Index (2.2%). Resources related to cognitive rehabilitation in Kuwait that are unavailable to practitioners include journal clubs (91%), special interest groups (89%), and continuing education programmes (82.6%). Barriers to cognitive rehabilitation practice included lack of sufficient funds for continuing education, lack of time, lack of standardized assessments, and lack of inter-professional teamwork. Conclusion Many adults in Kuwait live with cognitive impairment. There is a need to develop appropriate evidence-based cognitive rehabilitation clinical guidelines in Kuwait."
"28922182","The use of the Model of Occupational Self Efficacy in improving the cognitive functioning of individuals with brain injury: A pre- and post-intervention study.","BACKGROUND: Individuals diagnosed with a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) often experience major limitations in returning to work despite participating in rehabilitation programmes.OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine whether individuals who sustained a traumatic brain injury experienced improved cognitive functioning after participating in an intervention programme that utilizes the Model of Occupational Self-Efficacy (MOOSE).PARTICIPANTS: Ten (10) individuals who were diagnosed with a mild to moderate brain injury participated in the study.METHOD: The research study was positioned within the quantitative paradigm specifically utilizing a pre and post intervention research design. In order to gather data from the participants, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) was used to determine whether the individual with brain injury's cognitive functioning improved after participating in a vocational rehabilitation model called the Model of Occupational Self Efficacy (MOOSE).RESULTS: All the participants in this study presented with an improvement in MOCA test scores. The results of the study revealed a statistically significant effect of the intervention (i.e. MOOSE) on cognitive functioning measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, F(4, 6)<U+200A>=<U+200A>15.95, p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.002.CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicated that MOOSE is a useful model to facilitate the return of individuals living with a TBI back to work. It is also suggested that cognitive rehabilitative activities be included as part of the vocational rehabilitation programme."
