"14585160","Presenilin-interacting proteins.","Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) accounts for 5-10% of deaths from Alzheimer's disease (AD), and approximately 50% of these cases have been definitely linked to missense mutations in three genes, encoding the amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2). Of these, the vast majority of FAD-linked mutations are within PS1. There has been an extensive effort to identify proteins that functionally interact with PS1 and PS2 because of their clear roles in FAD. The goal of this review is to describe these proteins and to discuss in more detail the probable biological functions of a subset of the better-studied interacting proteins. In particular, the review examines APP, Notch, nicastrin, modifier of cellular adhesion (MOCA), beta-catenin, and the group of proteins involved in cell death, calcium metabolism and cell adhesion. We argue that, although a few of the interacting proteins are unambiguously involved in well-studied cellular pathways, their exact roles within these pathways have not been clearly defined, and indeed might vary between cell types. We also question the physiological relevance of some of the work linking PS to cell death pathways. Finally, we point out the value of using flies and worms to sort out the often contradictory work in the PS field, and we mention how knowledge of PS-interacting pathways will contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies in AD."
"15817019","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA: a brief screening tool for mild cognitive impairment.","OBJECTIVES: To develop a 10-minute cognitive screening tool (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA) to assist first-line physicians in detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a clinical state that often progresses to dementia.DESIGN: Validation study.SETTING: A community clinic and an academic center.PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-four patients meeting MCI clinical criteria supported by psychometric measures, 93 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score &gt; or =17), and 90 healthy elderly controls (NC).MEASUREMENTS: The MoCA and MMSE were administered to all participants, and sensitivity and specificity of both measures were assessed for detection of MCI and mild AD.RESULTS: Using a cutoff score 26, the MMSE had a sensitivity of 18% to detect MCI, whereas the MoCA detected 90% of MCI subjects. In the mild AD group, the MMSE had a sensitivity of 78%, whereas the MoCA detected 100%. Specificity was excellent for both MMSE and MoCA (100% and 87%, respectively).CONCLUSION: MCI as an entity is evolving and somewhat controversial. The MoCA is a brief cognitive screening tool with high sensitivity and specificity for detecting MCI as currently conceptualized in patients performing in the normal range on the MMSE."
"18044697","A comparison of the mini mental state exam to the Montreal cognitive assessment in identifying cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease.","Dementia is an important and increasingly recognized problem in Parkinson's disease (PD). The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) often fails to detect early cognitive decline. The Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) is a brief tool developed to detect mild cognitive impairment that assesses a broader range of domains frequently affected in PD. The scores on the MMSE and the MoCA were compared in 88 patients with PD. A pronounced ceiling effect was observed with the MMSE but not with the MoCA. The range and standard deviation of scores was larger with the MoCA(7-30, 4.26) than with the MMSE(16-30, 2.55). The percentage of subjects scoring below a cutoff of 26/30 (used by others to detect mild cognitive impairment) was higher on the MoCA (32%) than on the MMSE (11%) (P &lt; 0.000002). Compared to the MMSE, the MoCA may be a more sensitive tool to identify early cognitive impairment in PD."
"17542384","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment: validity and utility in a memory clinic setting.","OBJECTIVE: To prospectively validate the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in a UK memory clinic.METHOD: We administered the MoCA and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) to 32 subjects fulfilling diagnostic criteria for dementia, to 23 subjects fulfilling diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and to 12 memory clinic comparison subjects, at baseline and then at 6-month follow-up. Clinical diagnoses for dementia and MCI were made according to ICD-10 and Petersen criteria. The sensitivity and specificity of both measures were assessed for detection of MCI and dementia.RESULTS: With a cut-off score of 26, the MMSE had a sensitivity of 17% to detect subjects with MCI, whereas the MoCA detected 83%. The MMSE had a sensitivity of 25% to detect subjects with dementia, whereas the MoCA detected 94%. Specificity for the MMSE was 100%, and specificity for the MoCA was 50%. Of subjects with MCI, 35% developed dementia within 6 months, and all scored less than 26 points on the MoCA at baseline.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA is a useful brief screening tool for the detection of mild dementia or MCI in subjects scoring over 25 points on the MMSE. In patients already diagnosed with MCI, the MoCA helps identify those at risk of developing dementia at 6-month follow-up."
"17328916","Mild cognitive impairment in symptomatic and asymptomatic cerebrovascular disease.","We tried to evaluate and to compare usefulness of two brief cognitive tests in early detection of cognitive decline in subjects with increased cerebrovascular (CV) risk. As CV risk factors are recognised as important in etiology of dementia, we also aimed to determine the possible associations of specific CV risk factors and cognitive results. Patients (PGs) with first-ever stroke or TIA (N=110) and CV symptoms-free controls (CGs) with CV risk factors present (N=45) matched for age, gender and education level were tested using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) on admission, at three- and six-month points. In all subjects, detailed CV risk factors profile was assessed. We observed the decrement in cognitive performance during the six-month study period in both groups, more evident if MoCA (p&lt;0.001) than if MMSE was used (p=0.022). Six months after first stroke/TIA 83.6% PGs scored below normal range on MoCA. In PGs, positive associations for cognitive decrement and multiple CV risk factors (&gt;2) were found (p=0.034 for MMSE; p=0.002 for MoCA). In CGs, positive associations were found for cognitive decrement and arterial hypertension with increased IMT values (p&lt;0.001 for MMSE) and for multiple CV risk factors and arterial hypertension (p=0.003 for MoCA). The use of MoCA could aid to early recognition of cognitive deficits in persons with increased CV risk. Individuals with multiple CV risk factors seem to have increased risk of cognitive decline."
"18850670","Cross validation of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in community dwelling older adults residing in the Southeastern US.","OBJECTIVE: Cross validation study of the MoCA for the detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in a community-based cohort residing in the Southeastern United States.METHODS: One hundred and eighteen English-speaking older adults, who underwent diagnostic evaluation as part of an on-going prospective study, were administered the MoCA and MMSE. Twenty were diagnosed with AD, 24 met criteria for amnestic MCI and 74 were considered cognitively normal. Sensitivities and specificities were calculated using the recommended cut-off scores and ROC curve analyses were performed to determine optimal sensitivity and specificity. The influence of age, education and gender on MoCA score was also examined.RESULTS: Using a cut-off score of 24 or below, the MMSE was insensitive to cognitive impairment. Using the recommended cut-off score of 26, the MoCA detected 97% of those with cognitive impairment but specificity was fair (35%). Using a lower cut-off score of 23, the MoCA exhibited excellent sensitivity (96%) and specificity (95%).CONCLUSION: The MoCA appears to have utility as a cognitive screen for early detection of AD and for MCI and warrants further investigation regarding its applicability in primary care settings, varying ethnic groups, and younger at-risk individuals."
"18474719","Brief screening for mild cognitive impairment in elderly outpatient clinic: validation of the Korean version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a brief cognitive screening tool with high sensitivity for screening patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The authors examined the validity and reliability of the Korean version of the MoCA (MoCA-K) in elderly outpatients. The MoCA-K, a Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale, and neuropsychological batteries were administered to 196 elderly persons (mild Alzheimer's disease [AD] = 44, MCI = 37, normal controls [NC] = 115). MoCA-K scores were highly correlated with those of MMSE and CDR. Using a cutoff score of 22/23, the MoCA-K had an excellent sensitivity of 89% and a good specificity of 84% for screening MCI. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were good. The results obtained show that the MoCA-K is brief, reliable, and suitable for use as a screening tool to screen MCI patients in elderly outpatient clinic settings."
"18335256","Feasibility study of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in patients with brain metastases.","GOAL OF WORK: Detection of cognitive impairment in patients with brain metastases is important for both patient management and clinical trials. The most commonly used cognitive screen, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), though convenient, is not sensitive in these patients. More sensitive tools are less convenient and, therefore, uncommonly used. Therefore, a practical and sensitive tool is needed. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a good candidate, shown to be sensitive in detecting mild cognitive impairment in the pre-dementia setting. This study is the first to explore the MoCA in cancer patients and is aimed at determining the feasibility of administering the MoCA in brain tumor patients. The secondary objective is to explore the relationship between MoCA and MMSE scores.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients with brain metastases being treated with whole brain radiotherapy were prospectively accrued from January to May 2007. All patients were administered both the MoCA and MMSE.MAIN RESULTS: The MoCA was completed in 10 min in 88% of patients. 92% of all the patients found the MoCA to be only mildly or not at all inconvenient. Eighty percent of the patients were deemed cognitively impaired by the MoCA compared with 30% by the MMSE (p &lt; 0.0001). Of the 28 patients with a normal MMSE, 71% had cognitive impairment according to the MoCA. Overall, 50% of the patients had an abnormal MoCA, yet normal MMSE.CONCLUSION: The MoCA was well tolerated and provided additional information over the MMSE, justifying further validation studies of the MoCA in brain tumor patients."
"19937448","Validation studies of the Portuguese experimental version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA): confirmatory factor analysis.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a cognitive screening instrument created with the purpose of overcoming some of the insufficiencies of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The MoCA evaluates more cognitive areas and is comprised of more complex tasks as compared with the MMSE, which makes it a more sensitive instrument in the detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a state that often progresses to dementia. In this study we performed an analysis of the psychometric and diagnostic properties of the Portuguese experimental version of the MoCA in a clinical sample of 212 subjects with MCI and several dementia subtypes in a memory clinic setting. Additionally, we performed a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to assess the MoCA's latent factorial structure. In a clinical population, the MoCA is a valid and reliable instrument with good psychometric properties, revealing high sensitivity in identifying MCI and dementia patients who generally score within the normal range on the MMSE. By using the parcels method, CFA results showed very good/excellent adjustment indexes. The practical implications of this CFA study allow us to propose a two factor model factorial structure for the MoCA: a first factor designated Memory, which includes memory, language and orientation subtests (the latter being closely correlated with the former), and a second factor designated Attention/Executive Functions, comprised of attention, executive functions and visuospacial abilities tasks."
"19933974","Validity of the MoCA and MMSE in the detection of MCI and dementia in Parkinson disease.","BACKGROUND: Due to the high prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia in Parkinson disease (PD), routine cognitive screening is important for the optimal management of patients with PD. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is more sensitive than the commonly used Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in detecting MCI and dementia in patients without PD, but its validity in PD has not been established.METHODS: A representative sample of 132 patients with PD at 2 movement disorders centers was administered the MoCA, MMSE, and a neuropsychological battery with operationalized criteria for deficits. MCI and PD dementia (PDD) criteria were applied by an investigator blinded to the MoCA and MMSE results. The discriminant validity of the MoCA and MMSE as screening and diagnostic instruments was ascertained.RESULTS: Approximately one third of the sample met diagnostic criteria for a cognitive disorder (12.9% PDD and 17.4% MCI). Mean (SD) MoCA and MMSE scores were 25.0 (3.8) and 28.1 (2.0). The overall discriminant validity for detection of any cognitive disorder was similar for the MoCA and the MMSE (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve [95% confidence interval]): MoCA (0.79 [0.72, 0.87]) and MMSE (0.76 [0.67, 0.85]), but as a screening instrument the MoCA (optimal cutoff point = 26/27, 64% correctly diagnosed, lack of ceiling effect) was superior to the MMSE (optimal cutoff point = 29/30, 54% correctly diagnosed, presence of ceiling effect).CONCLUSIONS: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment, but not the Mini-Mental State Examination, has adequate psychometric properties as a screening instrument for the detection of mild cognitive impairment or dementia in Parkinson disease. However, a positive screen using either instrument requires additional assessment due to suboptimal specificity at the recommended screening cutoff point."
"19831129","Detection of cognitive impairment and dementia using the animal fluency test: the DECIDE study.","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of a one-minute screening test measured against a validated 10-minute screening test for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in detecting CI in patients aged &gt; or = 65 years with two or more vascular risk factors (VRF).METHODS: Patients (n=1523) aged 65 years or older without documented CI symptoms or dementia with two or more VRF participated in this study set in Canadian primary care practice. Baseline data was collected, followed by the 1-minute animal fluency (AF) test and the 10-minute Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Physicians (n=122) completed case reports during patient interviews and reported their diagnostic impression. AF test sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in predicting a positive MoCA was assessed.RESULTS: Study sample mean age was 79.7 years, 55% were female, 97.6% were Caucasian and 75% had &lt; or = 12 years of education. The AF test and MoCA detected CI in 52 and 56 percent of the study population, respectively. The AF test demonstrated sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in predicting a positive MoCA of 67 percent each. Physicians diagnostic impression of MCI was reported for 37% of patients, and of dementia for 6%.CONCLUSION: In an elderly population with at least two VRF, using AF can be useful in detecting previously unknown symptoms of CI or dementia. Screening for CI in this high risk population is warranted to assist physician recognition of early CI. The short AF administration time favours its incorporation into clinical practice."
"19772593","Quantitative gait analysis under dual-task in older people with mild cognitive impairment: a reliability study.","BACKGROUND: Reliability of quantitative gait assessment while dual-tasking (walking while doing a secondary task such as talking) in people with cognitive impairment is unknown. Dual-tasking gait assessment is becoming highly important for mobility research with older adults since better reflects their performance in the basic activities of daily living. Our purpose was to establish the test-retest reliability of assessing quantitative gait variables using an electronic walkway in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) under single and dual-task conditions.METHODS: The gait performance of 11 elderly individuals with MCI was evaluated using an electronic walkway (GAITRite System) in two sessions, one week apart. Six gait parameters (gait velocity, step length, stride length, step time, stride time, and double support time) were assessed under two conditions: single-task (sG: usual walking) and dual-task (dG: counting backwards from 100 while walking). Test-retest reliability was determined using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Gait variability was measured using coefficient of variation (CoV).RESULTS: Eleven participants (average age = 76.6 years, SD = 7.3) were assessed. They were high functioning (Clinical Dementia Rating Score = 0.5) with a mean Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) score of 28 (SD = 1.56), and a mean Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of 22.8 (SD = 1.23). Under dual-task conditions, mean gait velocity (GV) decreased significantly (sGV = 119.11 +/- 20.20 cm/s; dGV = 110.88 +/- 19.76 cm/s; p = 0.005). Additionally, under dual-task conditions, higher gait variability was found on stride time, step time, and double support time. Test-retest reliability was high (ICC&gt;0.85) for the six parameters evaluated under both conditions.CONCLUSION: In older people with MCI, variability of time-related gait parameters increased with dual-tasking suggesting cognitive control of gait performance. Assessment of quantitative gait variables using an electronic walkway is highly reliable under single and dual-task conditions. The presence of cognitive impairment did not preclude performance of dual-tasking in our sample supporting that this methodology can be reliably used in cognitive impaired older individuals."
"19582760","Pilot study of a three-step diagnostic pathway for young and old patients with Parkinson's disease dementia: screen, test and then diagnose.","OBJECTIVE: To pilot a three-step diagnostic model for young and old patients with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD).METHODS: Prospective investigator-blinded study. We developed a screening questionnaire for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and their caregivers. Further, patients were subjected to three screening instruments (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-revised (ACE-R) and a detailed neuropsychological examination (NPE). Based on the NPE, patients were divided in a PD (without dementia) and a PDD-group.RESULTS: Forty-one PD patients, aged 37-94 years, participated in this study. Patients were divided in a young group, &lt; or = 65 (n = 22) and an old group &gt;65 years (n = 19). In the young group (PDD, n = 5) the patient-screening questionnaire predicted PDD with a sensitivity/specificity of 100.0%/94.1%; in the old group (PDD, n = 10) the proxy-screening questionnaire predicted PDD with a sensitivity/specificity of 88.9%/66.7%. In the young group, ACE-R had the largest Area Under the Curve (AUC) 0.88 (0.70-1.00), in the old group MoCA (AUC 1.00). However, the three instruments did not differ significantly.CONCLUSIONS: It seems feasible and efficient to use three consecutive diagnostic steps for PDD: (1) a screening questionnaire, (2) if positive: MoCA, FAB or ACE-R as screening instrument and (3) if positive: a detailed NPE for diagnosing PDD."
"19582756","Brief cognitive screening instruments: an update.","OBJECTIVE: To review the recent literature on cognitive screening with a focus on brief screening methods in primary care as well as geriatric services.DESIGN: The Medline search engine was utilized using the keyword search terms 'cognitive screening', 'cognitive assessment', and 'dementia screening' limiting articles to those published in English since 1998.RESULTS: 679 abstracts were retrieved. Articles focusing on attitudes toward cognitive screening, current screening practices, promising new instruments and more recent updates contributing significant information on established instruments were retrieved and incorporated into this review. Reference lists were reviewed for relevant contributing articles. Instruments recommended from previous reviews of cognitive screening and those identified in surveys as most frequently used in primary care and geriatric settings were emphasized in this review.CONCLUSIONS: Dementia remains under-diagnosed in the elderly population. Despite significant limitations, the Mini Mental State Exam remains the most frequently used cognitive screening instrument. Its best value in the community and primary care appears to be for the purpose of ruling out a diagnosis of dementia. Instruments such as the Mini-Cog, Memory Impairment Screen (MIS), and the General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition (GPCOG) have consistently been recognized for utility in primary care. The clock drawing test (CDT) and newer instruments such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS) are gaining credibility due to improvements in sensitivity, addressing frontal/executive functioning, and decreasing susceptibility to cultural and educational biases."
"19260980","Montreal Cognitive Assessment Arabic version: reliability and validity prevalence of mild cognitive impairment among elderly attending geriatric clubs in Cairo.","AIM: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical label which includes elderly subjects with memory impairment and with no significant daily functional disability. MCI is an important target for Alzheimer's dementia prevention studies. Data on the prevalence and incidence of MCI varies greatly according to cultural difference. The first aim of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Arabic version in MCI detection. The second was to determine the prevalence of MCI among apparently healthy elderly people attending geriatric clubs in Cairo.METHODS: In stage I reliability &amp; validity of MoCA Arabic version were assessed in reference to Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG). In stage II prevalence of MCI was estimated using Arabic MoCA among apparently healthy elderly attending geriatric clubs. These geriatric clubs were randomly selected from different regions in Cairo governorate.RESULTS: Test-retest reliability data of the Arabic MoCA were collected approximately 35.0 +/- 17.6 days apart. The mean change in Arabic MoCA scores from the first to second evaluation was 0.9 +/- 2.5 points, and correlation between the two evaluations was high (correlation coefficient = 0.92, P &lt; 0.001). The internal consistency of the Arabic MoCA was good, yielding a Cronbach's alpha on the standardized items of 0.83. In diagnosing mild cognitive impairment, the Arabic MoCA showed 92.3% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity. The prevalence of MCI among elderly subjects attending geriatric clubs in Cairo is 34.2% and 44.3% of healthy men and women, respectively.CONCLUSION: Older age, female sex and less education are the independent risk factors for MCI among apparently healthy elderly subjects attending geriatric clubs in Cairo."
"21070702","Screening cognitive performance with the Resident Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Cognitive Performance Scale.","OBJECTIVE: The validity of the Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS) embedded in the Resident Assessment Instrument-Mental Health (RAI-MH) was evaluated among adult psychiatric inpatients.METHODS: The CPS is a brief measure of cognitive performance, with scores ranging from 0 (intact) to 6 (very severe impairment). The CPS scores were compared with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores for 215 adult psychiatric inpatients.RESULTS: The CPS scores were significantly correlated with MMSE scores (r = -0.69, P &lt; 0.001) and MoCA scores (r = -0.69, P &lt; 0.001). Higher scores on the CPS were associated with greater functional impairment, older age, and a greater prevalence of dementia diagnoses than lower CPS scores.CONCLUSIONS: Pilot data show the CPS is a valid screening measure of cognitive performance among adult psychiatric inpatients. Additional research is needed to replicate our study using a larger sample with more diverse mental health conditions."
"21060094","The MoCA: well-suited screen for cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease.","OBJECTIVE: To establish the diagnostic accuracy of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) when screening externally validated cognition in Parkinson disease (PD), by comparison with a PD-focused test (Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson disease-Cognition [SCOPA-COG]) and the standardized Mini-Mental State Examination (S-MMSE) as benchmarks.METHODS: A convenience sample of 114 patients with idiopathic PD and 47 healthy controls was examined in a movement disorders center. The 21 patients with dementia (PD-D) were diagnosed using Movement Disorders Society criteria, externally validated by detailed independent functional and neuropsychological tests. The 21 patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) scored 1.5 SD or more below normative data in at least 2 measures in 1 of 4 cognitive domains. Other patients had normal cognition (PD-N).RESULTS: Primary outcomes using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses showed that all 3 mental status tests produced excellent discrimination of PD-D from patients without dementia (area under the curve [AUC], 87%-91%) and PD-MCI from PD-N patients (AUC, 78%-90%), but the MoCA was generally better suited across both assessments. The optimal MoCA screening cutoffs were &lt;21/30 for PD-D (sensitivity 81%; specificity 95%; negative predictive value [NPV] 92%) and &lt;26/30 for PD-MCI (sensitivity 90%; specificity 75%; NPV 95%). Further support that the MoCA is at least equivalent to the SCOPA-COG, and superior to the S-MMSE, came from the simultaneous classification of the 3 PD patient groups (volumes under a 3-dimensional ROC surface, chance = 17%: MoCA 79%, confidence interval [CI] 70%-89%; SCOPA-COG 74%, CI 62%-86%; MMSE-Sevens item 56%, CI 44%-68%; MMSE-World item 62%, CI 50%-73%).CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA is a suitably accurate, brief test when screening all levels of cognition in PD."
"20889166","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is superior to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for the detection of vascular cognitive impairment after acute stroke.","BACKGROUND: The majority of patient with post-stroke Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI) have Vascular Cognitive Impairment No Dementia (VCIND). The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) has been criticized as a poor screening test for VCIND due to insensitivity to visuospatial and executive function impairments. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was designed to be more sensitive to such deficits and may therefore be a superior screening instrument for VCIND.METHODS: Stable patients within 14days of their index stroke without significant physical disability, aphasia, dysarthria, active psychiatric illness or pre-existing dementia were eligible. Cognitive and neurological measures were administered after informed consent.RESULTS: 100 patients were recruited. Of the 57 patients with unimpaired MMSE scores, 18 (32%) patients had an impaired MoCA score. By comparison, only 2 out of the 41 (4.9%) patients with unimpaired MoCA scores had impaired MMSE scores. Moreover, MMSE domain subtest scores could not differentiate between groups of differing screening test results, whilst MoCA domain subtest scores (Visuospatial/Executive Function, Attention and Recall) could.CONCLUSION: The MoCA is more sensitive than the MMSE in screening for cognitive impairment after acute stroke. Longitudinal studies are required to establish the prognostic value of MoCA and MMSE evaluation in the acute post-stroke period for cognitive impairment as defined by the standard method of formal neuropsychological evaluation 3-6 months after stroke."
"20878991","A recommended scale for cognitive screening in clinical trials of Parkinson's disease.","Cognitive impairment is common in Parkinson's disease (PD). There is a critical need for a brief, standard cognitive screening measure for use in PD trials whose primary focus is not on cognition. The Parkinson Study Group (PSG) Cognitive/Psychiatric Working Group formed a Task Force to make recommendations for a cognitive scale that could screen for dementia and mild cognitive impairment in clinical trials of PD where cognition is not the primary outcome. This Task Force conducted a systematic literature search for cognitive assessments previously used in a PD population. Scales were then evaluated for their appropriateness to screen for cognitive deficits in clinical trials, including brief administration time (&lt;15 minutes), assessment of the major cognitive domains, and potential to detect subtle cognitive impairment in PD. Five scales of global cognition met the predetermined screening criteria and were considered for review. Based on the Task Force's evaluation criteria the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), appeared to be the most suitable measure. This Task Force recommends consideration of the MoCA as a minimum cognitive screening measure in clinical trials of PD where cognitive performance is not the primary outcome measure. The MoCA still requires further study of its diagnostic utility in PD populations but appears to be the most appropriate measure among the currently available brief cognitive assessments. Widespread adoption of a single instrument such as the MoCA in clinical trials can improve comparability between research studies on PD."
"20808118","Screening and case finding tools for the detection of dementia. Part I: evidence-based meta-analysis of multidomain tests.","AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of all brief multidomain alternatives to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in the detection of dementia.METHODS: A literature search, critical appraisal, and meta-analysis were conducted of robust diagnostic validity studies involving cognitive batteries. Twenty-nine distinct brief batteries were tested in 44 large-scale analyses. Twenty studies took place in specialist settings (11 in memory clinics and 9 in secondary care), ten studies were conducted in primary care, and 14 in the community.RESULTS: In community settings with a low prevalence of dementia, short screening methods of no more than 10 minutes had an overall sensitivity of 72.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 60.4%-82.3%) and a specificity of 88.2% (95% CI = 83.0%-92.5%). The optimal individual tests were the Telephonic interview based on MSQ, Category fluency/Memory impairment screen-Telephonic interview and 6 item Cognitive Impairment Test (6-CIT), but data were limited by the absence of multiple independent confirmation for any individual test. In primary care where the prevalence of dementia is usually modest, the optimal individual tools were the Abbreviated mental test score/Mental status questionnaire (MSQ), and Prueba cognitive de leganes (PCL). Furthermore, the Abbreviated mental test score (AMTS) was superior to the MMSE for case finding, but for screening the MMSE was optimal. If length is not a major consideration, the MMSE may remain the best tool for primary care clinicians who want to rule in and rule out a diagnosis. In specialist settings where the prevalence of dementia is often high, the optimal individual tools were the DEMTECT, Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA), Memory Alteration test, and MINI-COG. Two tools were potentially superior to the MMSE for rule in and rule out, namely the 6-CIT and MINI-COG. Only four analyses looked specifically at accuracy in early-stage dementia, and each showed at least equivalent diagnostic accuracy, suggesting these methods might be applicable to early identification.CONCLUSION: A large number of alternatives to the MMSE have now been validated in large samples with favorable rule-in and rule-out accuracy. Evidence to date suggests for those wishing to use brief battery tests then the original MMSE or the AMTS should be considered in primary care and either the 6-CIT or the MINI-COG should be considered in specialist settings."
"20721924","A comparison of two brief screening measures of cognitive impairment in Huntington's disease.","The goal of this study was to explore whether the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a new screening instrument, would be more sensitive to mild to moderate cognitive impairment in Huntington's disease (HD) than an established screening measure, the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE). Our reasoning for this query is that the MoCA includes a broader range of test items and an additional assessment of executive functioning and attention compared with the MMSE. Using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to examine performance of HD and control groups on both tests on overall scores and scores from various subdomains (i.e., visuospatial abilities) revealed that the MoCA achieved higher sensitivity without sacrificing specificity in many domains relative to the MMSE."
"20714236","Cognitive impairment predicts functional capacity in dementia-free patients with cardiovascular disease.","BACKGROUND AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVE: A high proportion of elderly people with cardiovascular diseases and risk factors have mild forms of cognitive impairment, the functional impact of which is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine whether subtle cognitive impairment contributes to limitations in instrumental activities of daily living in this group and whether this association is independent of physical comorbidity and other potentially confounding factors.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and nineteen nondemented patients were recruited from cardiovascular and diabetic hospital outpatient clinics. Functional dependence was assessed using the self-report version of the instrumental activities of daily living scale. Cognitive ability was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Demographic and clinical information was collected via interview and a review of hospital records. Standard logistic regression was performed to identify factors independently associated with functional status.RESULTS: Five variables (sex, cardiovascular disease burden, non-cardiovascular disease burden, cognitive status, and age) were independently associated with an increased likelihood of requiring assistance with 1 or more everyday activities. The likelihood of needing assistance increased 2.05 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.59-2.79) for each additional cardiovascular diagnosis present and 1.12 times (95% CI, 1.01-1.27) for every point lower on MoCA. Thus, in comparison to a person with a perfect MoCA score, a person who scored in the cognitively impaired range (&lt;23) was 7.7 (CI, 7.07-8.89) times more likely to report that he/she required assistance with an everyday activity.CONCLUSION: Cognitive impairments appear to reduce the ability to independently carry out routine daily tasks in patients with cardiovascular diseases and risk factors. Cognition should therefore be considered along with physical symptoms when assessing and responding to the support needs of this group."
"20689285","Cognitive deterioration rates in patients with Parkinson's disease from northeastern China.","AIMS: Cognitive impairment (CI) is common in Parkinson's disease (PD), and the cognitive deterioration rate (CDR) is heterogeneous among PD patients. However, very few studies have reported on the association of PD features and risk factors with rapid CDR. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is considered to be a sensitive and reliable approach to detect mild CI. In the present study, we sought to define and compare the cognitive profiles and clinical features of PD patients with slow or rapid CDRs, and then to identify the PD risk factors associated with rapid CDR.METHODS: A cross-sectional study of cognitive rate was performed using the MoCA in a cohort of 73 PD patients and 41 controls matched for age, sex and education level.RESULTS: The rapid CDR group was characterized by older age (58.8 years in slow CDR vs. 64.1 in rapid CDR; p = 0.02), later age at disease onset (52.7 vs. 61.7 years; p &lt; 0.001), a faster deterioration rate of movement symptoms (UPDRS III increment of 12.8 vs. 5.9/year; p &lt; 0.001), a higher rate in multiple-domain CI (38.9 vs. 10.8%), and generally lower MoCA subscores for the Clock Drawing Test, attention, verbal fluency and abstraction. According to the univariate logistic regression model, onset age, movement deterioration rate, multiple domains CI and executive function CI were risk factors for rapid CDR. However, only the movement deterioration rate (p = 0.01) and onset age (p = 0.05) remained independent predictors for rapid CDR according to the multivariate logistic regression model.CONCLUSIONS: The CI deterioration in a subset of PD patients appears to progress more rapidly. Identifying those PD patients may not only help to predict the development of PD dementia, but also facilitate therapeutic intervention at early disease stages."

"20378863","Underestimation of cognitive impairment by Mini-Mental State Examination versus the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in patients with transient ischemic attack and stroke: a population-based study.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is insensitive to mild cognitive impairment and executive function. The more recently developed Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), an alternative, brief 30-point global cognitive screen, might pick up more cognitive abnormalities in patients with cerebrovascular disease.METHODS: In a population-based study (Oxford Vascular Study) of transient ischemic attack and stroke, the MMSE and MoCA were administered to consecutive patients at 6-month or 5-year follow-up. Accepted cutoffs of MMSE &lt;27 and MoCA &lt;26 were taken to indicate cognitive impairment.RESULTS: Of 493 patients, 413 (84%) were testable. Untestable patients were older (75.5 versus 69.9 years, P&lt;0.001) and often had dysphasia (24%) or dementia (15%). Although MMSE and MoCA scores were highly correlated (r(2)=0.80, P&lt;0.001), MMSE scores were skewed toward higher values, whereas MoCA scores were normally distributed: median and interquartile range 28 (26 to 29) and 23 (20 to 26), respectively. Two hundred ninety-one of 413 (70%) patients had MoCA &lt;26 of whom 162 had MMSE &gt; or =27, whereas only 5 patients had MoCA &gt; or =26 and MMSE &lt;27 (P&lt;0.0001). In patients with MMSE &gt; or =27, MoCA &lt;26 was associated with higher Rankin scores (P=0.0003) and deficits in delayed recall, abstraction, visuospatial/executive function, and sustained attention.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA picked up substantially more cognitive abnormalities after transient ischemic attack and stroke than the MMSE, demonstrating deficits in executive function, attention, and delayed recall."
"20310038","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment: a screening tool for mild cognitive impairment in REM sleep behavior disorder.","Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a frequent feature in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), a sleep disturbance that can be a preclinical stage of Parkinson's disease or Lewy body dementia. We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of two brief screening tools, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), in detecting MCI in idiopathic RBD. Thirty-eight idiopathic RBD patients underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, including the MoCA and the MMSE. Receiver operating characteristic curves were created for the MoCA and the MMSE to assess their ability to identify MCI in idiopathic RBD patients, with neuropsychological assessment as the gold standard. For the MoCA, a normality cutoff of 26 yielded the best balance between sensitivity (76%) and specificity (85%) with a correct classification of 79%. For the MMSE, the optimal normality cutoff was 30, with a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 54% and a correct classification of 74%. The MoCA is superior to the MMSE in detecting MCI in idiopathic RBD patients, showing good sensitivity and very good specificity."
"20141536","Brief screening tool for mild cognitive impairment in older Japanese: validation of the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment.","AIM: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), developed by Dr Nasreddine (Nasreddine et al. 2005), is a brief cognitive screening tool for detecting older people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We examined the reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the MoCA (MoCA-J) in older Japanese subjects.METHODS: Subjects were recruited from the outpatient memory clinic of Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital or community-based medical health check-ups in 2008. The MoCA-J, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the revised version of Hasegawa's Dementia Scale (HDS-R), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale, and routine neuropsychological batteries were conducted on 96 older subjects. Mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) was found in 30 subjects and MCI in 30, with 36 normal controls.RESULTS: The Cronbach's alpha of MoCA-J as an index of internal consistency was 0.74. The test-retest reliability of MoCA, using intraclass correlation coefficient between the scores at baseline survey and follow-up survey 8 weeks later was 0.88 (P &lt; 0.001). MoCA-J score was highly correlated with MMSE (r = 0.83, P &lt; 0.001), HDS-R (r = 0.79, P &lt; 0.001) and CDR (r = -0.79, P &lt; 0.001) scores. The areas under receiver-operator curves (AUC) for predicting MCI and AD groups by the MoCA-J were 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.90-1.00) and 0.99 (95% CI = 0.00-1.00), respectively. The corresponding values for MMSE and HDS-R were 0.85 (95% CI = 0.75-0.95) and 0.97 (95% CI = 0.00-1.00), and 0.86 (95% CI = 0.76-0.95) and 0.97 (95% CI = 0.00-1.00), respectively. Using a cut-off point of 25/26, the MoCA-J demonstrated a sensitivity of 93.0% and a specificity of 87.0% in screening MCI.CONCLUSION: The MoCA-J could be a useful cognitive test for screening MCI, and could be recommended in a primary clinical setting and for geriatric health screening in the community."
"20108371","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment as a screening tool for cognitive dysfunction in Huntington's disease.","Cognitive dysfunction is one of the hallmarks of Huntington's disease (HD) and may precede the onset of motor symptoms. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a brief cognitive screening instrument with high specificity and sensitivity for detecting early cognitive impairments, has not been studied in the HD population. In this study, we compare the MoCA with the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) as a screening tool for cognitive dysfunction among 53 patients with HD. The mean MMSE score was 26 +/- 2.4, and mean MoCA score was 21 +/- 4.4. Twenty-one patients (81%) of those who scored &gt;or=26 on the MMSE had the MoCA score &lt;26. Thirty-two patients (78%) of those who scored &gt;or=24 on the MMSE had the MoCA score &lt;24. The MoCA may be a more sensitive screening tool for cognitive impairments in HD relative to the MMSE."
"20101272","Application study of quick cognitive screening test in identifying mild cognitive impairment.","OBJECTIVE: To assess whether quick cognitive screening test (QCST) could quickly identify mild cognitive impairment (MCI).METHODS: QCST and a full set of standardized neuropsychological tests, including mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) were performed. A total number of 121 cases of MCI [41 cases of amnestic MCI-single domain (aMCI-s); 44 of amnestic MCI-multiple domain (aMCI-m); 36 of nonamnestic MCI (naMCI)], 79 cases of mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 186 healthy elderly volunteers were employed in the present study. All the participants (55-85 years old) had an educational level no less than 5 years. QCST subtests included word list recall, naming test, animal fluency test, similarity test, color trail-1min, clock drawing test, finger construction test, and digit span test. The total score of QCST was 90 points, 10 points for each index of subtests.RESULTS: The total scores of QCST in MCI, AD and the control groups were (58.13+/-8.18), (44.53+/-10.54) and (72.92+/-6.85) points, respectively. According to the educational level, the cut off scores of participants with an educational level of 5-8 years, 9-12 years and more than 13 years were 63, 65 and 68 points, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of QCST in detection of MCI were 87.6% (85.7% for aMCI-s, 90.1% for aMCI-m and 89.5% for naMCI) and 84.3%, respectively. The area under the curve was 0.923 (95% CI: 0.892-0.953). Delayed memory, color trail-1min and similarity test could help distinguish between aMCI and naMCI.CONCLUSION: QCST may have a good sensitivity and specificity for MCI detection, which warrants its further clinical application."
"22193353","Montreal cognitive assessment: validation study for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was recently proposed as a cognitive screening test for milder forms of cognitive impairment, having surpassed the well-known limitations of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). This study aims to validate the MoCA for screening Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD) through an analysis of diagnostic accuracy and the proposal of cut-offs. Patients were classified into 2 clinical groups according to standard criteria: MCI (n=90) and AD (n=90). The 2 control groups (C-MCI: n=90; C-AD: n=90) consisted of cognitively healthy community dwellers selected to match patients in sex, age, and education. The MoCA showed consistently superior psychometric properties compared with the MMSE, and higher diagnostic accuracy to discriminate between MCI (area under the curve=0.856; 95% confidence interval, 0.796-0.904) and AD patients (area under the curve=0.980; 95% confidence interval, 0.947-0.995). At an optimal cut-off of below 22 for MCI and below 17 for AD, the MoCA achieved significantly superior values in comparison with MMSE for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and classification accuracy. Furthermore, the MoCA revealed higher sensitivity to cognitive decline in longitudinal monitoring. This study provides robust evidence that the MoCA is a better cognitive tool than the widely used MMSE for the screening and monitoring of MCI and AD in clinical settings."
"22163236","Proactive approach in detecting elderly subjects with cognitive decline in general practitioners' practices.","BACKGROUND: Although cognitive decline is a common finding among the elderly and is considered a risk factor for developing dementia, it is rarely diagnosed by general practitioners (GPs).AIM: To evaluate cognitive function with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in asymptomatic subjects in daily GP practice and compare subjects who confirmed having cognitive problems with subjects who did not.METHODS: 388 consecutive subjects &gt;65 years of age who consulted their GP were interviewed and tested with MMSE and MoCA.RESULTS: None of the study subjects spontaneously complained of cognitive or memory problems. 155 subjects (39.94%) confirmed having cognitive problems and 233 (60.05%) did not even when asked. The prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was 18.30% (95% CI 14.36-22.04) and the prevalence of cognitive impairment/no dementia (CIND) was 17.27% (95% CI 13.50-21.04). Delayed memory recall as a separate cognitive domain in MoCA was significantly worse in subjects with MCI (p = 0.00958) and in those with CIND (p = 0.0208).CONCLUSION: There is a significant number of patients in daily GP practices with unrecognized, but objectively verifiable, cognitive deficits who do not report having cognitive problems. They can be identified by assessment with MMSE and MoCA already in the GP practice."
"22156700","MoCA, ACE-R, and MMSE versus the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network Vascular Cognitive Impairment Harmonization Standards Neuropsychological Battery after TIA and stroke.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R) are proposed as short cognitive tests for use after stroke, but there are few published validations against a neuropsychological battery. We studied the relationship between MoCA, ACE-R, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in patients with cerebrovascular disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).METHODS: One hundred consecutive non-institutionalized patients had the MMSE, MoCA, ACE-R, and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network Vascular Cognitive Impairment Harmonization Standards Neuropsychological Battery = 1 year after transient ischemic attack or stroke in a population-based study. MCI was diagnosed using modified Petersen criteria in which subjective cognitive complaint is not required (equivalent to cognitive impairment-no dementia) and subtyped by number and type of cognitive domains affected.RESULTS: Among 91 nondemented subjects completing neuropsychological testing (mean/SD age, 73.4/11.6 years; 44% female; 56% stroke), 39 (42%) had MCI (amnestic multiple domain=10, nonamnestic multiple domain=9, nonamnestic single domain=19, amnestic single domain=1). Sensitivity and specificity for MCI were optimal with MoCA &lt;25 (sensitivity=77%, specificity=83%) and ACE-R &lt;94 (sensitivity=83%, specificity=73%). Both tests detected amnestic MCI better than nonamnestic single-domain impairment. MMSE only achieved sensitivity &gt;70% at a cutoff of &lt;29, mainly due to relative insensitivity to single-domain impairment.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA and ACE-R had good sensitivity and specificity for MCI defined using the Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network Vascular Cognitive Impairment Battery =1 year after transient ischemic attack and stroke, whereas the MMSE showed a ceiling effect. However, optimal cutoffs will depend on use for screening (high sensitivity) or diagnosis (high specificity). Lack of timed measures of processing speed may explain the relative insensitivity of the MoCA and ACE-R to single nonmemory domain impairment."

This study examined the psychometric properties and the validity of the Taiwan version of the MoCA (MoCA-T) in an elderly outpatient population.METHODS: Participants completed the MoCA-T, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Chinese Version Verbal Learning Test. The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) was made based on the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, and MCI was diagnosed through the criteria proposed by Petersen et al. (2001).RESULTS: Data were collected from 207 participants (115 males/92 females, mean age: 77.3  7.5 years). Ninety-eight participants were diagnosed with AD, 71 with MCI, and 38 were normal controls. The area under the receiver operator curves (AUC) for predicting AD was 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.97-1.00) for the MMSE, and 0.99 (95% CI = 0.98-1.00) for the MoCA-T. The AUC for predicting MCI was 0.81 (95% CI = 0.72-0.89) using the MMSE and 0.91 (95% CI = 0.86-1.00) using the MoCA-T. Using an optimal cut-off score of 23/24, the MoCA-T had a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 78% for MCI. Item response theory analysis indicated that the level of information provided by each subtest of the MoCA-T was consistent. The frontal and language subscales provided higher discriminating power than the other subscales in the detection of MCI.CONCLUSION: Compared to the MMSE, the MoCA-T provides better psychometric properties in the detection of MCI. The utility of the MoCA-T is optimal in mild to moderate cognitive dysfunction."
"22115097","Construct Validity of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a brief instrument developed for the screening of milder forms of cognitive impairment. The present study aims to assess the construct related validity of the MoCA through the establishment of the factorial, convergent, and discriminant related validities, and the reliability of data. In a Portuguese sample of 830 participants, several models were tested using Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Although all tested models showed a good fit, the six-factor model based on the conceptual model proposed by the MoCA's authors showed a significantly better fit. The results allowed us to establish the factorial, convergent, and discriminant validity of this six-dimensional structure. An overall psychometric adequacy of the items, and a good reliability were also found. This study contributes to overcome an important gap in the construct related validity of this instrument. The present findings corroborate the six-dimensional structure of the MoCA and provide good evidence of the construct related validity. The MoCA has proved to be an appropriate measure for cognitive screening taking into account different cognitive domains, which will enable clinicians and researchers to use this test and its six latent dimensions to achieve a better understanding of the individuals' cognitive profile."
"22115042","MOCA is an integrator of the neuronal death signals that are activated by familial Alzheimer's disease-related mutants of amyloid  precursor protein and presenilins.","The death of cholinergic neurons in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical regions is linked to irreversible dementia relevant to AD (Alzheimer's disease). Although multiple studies have shown that expression of a FAD (familial AD)-linked APP (amyloid  precursor protein) or a PS (presenilin) mutant, but not that of wild-type APP or PS, induced neuronal death by activating intracellular death signals, it remains to be addressed how these signals are interrelated and what the key molecule involved in this process is. In the present study, we show that the PS1-mediated (or possibly the PS2-mediated) signal is essential for the APP-mediated death in a <U+03B3>-secretase-independent manner and vice versa. MOCA (modifier of cell adhesion), which was originally identified as being a PS- and Rac1-binding protein, is a common downstream constituent of these neuronal death signals. Detailed molecular analysis indicates that MOCA is a key molecule of the AD-relevant neuronal death signals that links the PS-mediated death signal with the APP-mediated death signal at a point between Rac1 [or Cdc42 (cell division cycle 42)] and ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1)."

However the prevalence and the pattern of these complications are lacking for LRRK2 (leucine-rich kinase 2)-associated PD patients.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess cognitive function in LRRK2- associated PD patients.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 55 patients diagnosed with PD-related LRRK2 G2019S mutation were included in the study and compared to the same number of G2019S non-carriers PD patients. Age, sex, disease duration, the movement disorder society-unified Parkinson's Disease rating scale (MDS-UPDRS), Hoehn and Yahr stage, Schwab and England scale and the 30-item geriatric depression scale (GDS) scores were noted. Cognitive assessment included MMSE (Mini-Mental Examination), MOCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and FAB (Frontal Assessment Battery).RESULTS: MMSE, MOCA and FAB performance in G2019S carriers PD patients was similar to that of non-carriers. In both groups, performance was primarily impaired on visuospatial and executive tasks. Cognitive impairment was associated with older age, lower educational level and increased severity of motor impairment.CONCLUSION: Cognitive functions were similarly affected in PD patients with and without LRRK2 G2019S mutation with mainly impaired visuospatial and executive abilities. However, these results need to be confirmed by further large and prospective studies."
"22014176","Screening utility of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA): in place of--or as well as--the MMSE?","BACKGROUND: This aim of this study was to assess the clinical utility of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as a screening instrument for cognitive impairment in patients referred to a memory clinic, alone and in combination with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).METHODS: This was a pragmatic prospective study of consecutive referrals attending a memory clinic (n = 150) over an 18-month period. Patients were diagnosed using standard clinical diagnostic criteria for dementia (DSM-IV) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI; cognitive impairment prevalence = 43%) independent of MoCA test scores.RESULTS: MoCA proved acceptable to patients and was quick and easy to use. Using the cut-offs for MoCA and MMSE specified in the index paper (=26/30), MoCA was more sensitive than MMSE (0.97 vs 0.65) but less specific (0.60 vs 0.89), with better diagnostic accuracy (area under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve 0.91 vs 0.83). Downward adjustment of the MoCA cut-off to =20/30 maximized test accuracy and improved specificity (0.95) for some loss of sensitivity (0.63). Combining MoCA with the MMSE - either in series or in parallel - did not improve diagnostic utility above that with either test alone.CONCLUSIONS: In a memory clinic population, MoCA proved sensitive for the diagnosis of cognitive impairment. Use of a cut-off lower than that specified in the index study may be required to improve overall test accuracy and specificity for some loss of sensitivity in populations with a high prior probability of cognitive impairment. Combining the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) with the MMSE did not improve diagnostic utility."

DWI was performed at 1.5 T with a fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and the independent ADC mapping was generated after imaging acquisition. Ninety regional parcellations were adopted in a Brain Search (BS) based on the automated anatomic labeling atlas. The gray scale intensities (water diffusivity) from the collected ADC mappings were analyzed with BS. The mean value of each anatomical brain region was compared among aMCI, AD, and NC. The statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) group differences are displayed in color.RESULTS: During the pathological process of AD, the changes of water diffusivity appeared first in the left hippocampus, then gradually progressed to the bilateral sides and eventually displayed right lateralization. The ADC values from aMCI were obviously elevated compared to the values from the NC group in the left limbic cortex. Between the AD and NC groups, the significantly different brain areas included the bilateral hippocampus, the Cingulum_Mid, the ParaHippocampal_R, and the Temporal and Frontal lobes. There was a negative correlation between the ADC values and the scores from MMSE, MoCA, the Digit test, Raven's IQ, and WAIS IQ. Additionally, the ADC values were positively correlated with the scores from CDR, ADL, and ADAS-Cog.CONCLUSION: The water diffusivity for aMCI and AD displays asymmetric anatomical lateralization. The water diffusivity alterations can be analyzed and visualized with our newly designed analytic imaging software, BS, which can be used as a good reference for examining and diagnosing aMCI and AD patients."
"21943640","Carotid endarterectomy protects elderly patients from cognitive decline: a prospective study.","BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) reduces the risk of stroke in selected patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid disease, but its beneficial influence on cognitive performance in the elderly remains debatable. This prospective study sought to determine early and long-term neurocognitive outcomes after CEA for severe unilateral carotid artery stenosis.METHODS: From July 2006 to December 2008, 75 symptomatic (group A) and 70 asymptomatic patients (group B) aged 65 years and older underwent CEA under general anesthesia. Sixty-eight age- and sex-matched individuals who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the same period at our institution served as a control group (group H). Patients with contralateral severe carotid stenosis or occlusion and those with dementia, depression, or a history of major stroke were excluded. Cognitive function was assessed using 2 neuropsychological tests (the Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]) performed preoperatively (T0) and then 3 (T1) and 12 months (T2) after operation. A change of at least 2 points between the scores at T0 and T2 was arbitrarily considered as clinically significant.RESULTS: At T0, group A revealed significant cognitive impairments in both mean test scores by comparison with group H (P = .005 and P &lt; .01, respectively), whereas there were no significant differences between groups A and B, or between groups B and H. Postoperatively, symptomatic patients had significant improvements in their mean cognitive performance scores in both tests (P &lt; .01 and P &lt; .01, respectively), whereas there were no changes in the asymptomatic and control patients' scores. No significant differences emerged for the MMSE scores in the 3 groups, whereas there was a marginally significant difference in the MoCA scores between groups A and H (P = .08), but not for A versus B or B versus H when clinically significant scores were considered.CONCLUSION: Our study showed that only elderly symptomatic patients with severe carotid lesions had a significant improvement in cognitive performance scores after CEA, although the benefit was considered clinically not significant. This suggests that CEA does not diminish neurocognitive functions, but it might provide some protection against cognitive decline in the elderly."
"21903955","Transient cognitive impairment in TIA and minor stroke.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acute cognitive impairment and delirium occur after major stroke and are associated with poor cognitive outcome. We conducted a population-based study to determine whether transient cognitive impairment (TCI) is seen acutely after cerebral transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke, and whether it predicts long-term cognitive decline.METHODS: Mini-mental-state examination was performed in consecutive testable patients with TIA or minor stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale =3) seen acutely (1-7 days) in the Oxford Vascular Study (2002-2005) versus after 7 days, and in referrals seen acutely who had a subsequent noncerebrovascular diagnosis. We defined TCI as a baseline Mini-mental-state examination score =2 points below the 1-month follow-up score, and identified cognitive impairment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] &lt;26/30) and severe dementia at 1-, 2-, and 5-year follow-up.RESULTS: In 280 TIA and minor stroke patients (mean age/SD 73.5/11.8 years), TCI was more frequent in those seen at 1 to 7 days (80/206; 38.9%) versus later (14/74; 19%; P=0.002) or in noncerebrovascular patients (10/47; 21%; P=0.004). TCI was associated with acute confusion (OR, 5.5; 95% CI, 2.5-11.7; P&lt;0.0001), acute infarct on computed tomography (OR, 2.0; 1.2-3.5; P=0.01), and with residual focal deficits (OR,1.94; 1.13-3.34; P=0.01). However, it was still seen acutely in those whose focal deficits had resolved by time of assessment (41/120; 34%). Although patients with TCI had similar Mini-mental-state examination score by 1 month compared with those without TCI, their 5-year risks of cognitive impairment (OR, 4.3; 1.2-15.7; P=0.03) and severe dementia (OR, 4.9; 1.0-25.8; P=0.05) were increased.CONCLUSIONS: TCI is a manifestation of TIA and minor stroke, and may persist beyond resolution of focal symptoms. Our findings have implications for definitions in TIA and minor stroke and suggest that cognitive fragility may be revealed by minor cerebrovascular events."

Patients with MRI confirmed acute lacunar infarcts without pre-existing dementia were recruited. Logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for developing PSCI.RESULTS: 145 patients with a mean age of 55.8 years were studied of which 48 patients (33.1%) were identified to have PSCI. Patients with PSCI performed worse on the MMSE, MOCA and FAB and had significantly greater white matter hyperintensity (WMH) in the frontal subcortical (FSC) region (p = 0.006) and higher frontal subcortical acute infarct load (p = 0.002). Logistic regression demonstrated that deep subcortical WMH (odds ratio, OR = 1.45) and acute FSC infarcts (OR = 1.51) were associated with PSCI. High WMH load without acute FSC infarcts was associated with increased risk of PSCI (OR = 4.1). When patients developed acute FSC infarcts on pre-existing severe WMH, the risk of PSCI increased substantially (OR = 11.0).CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acute lacunar infarcts in the FSC region have 1.5 times risk of PSCI. This risk increases substantially to 11 times when there is pre-existing severe white matter disease."
"21642663","Neuroimaging signatures and cognitive correlates of the montreal cognitive assessment screen in a nonclinical elderly sample.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) screen was developed as a brief instrument to identify mild cognitive impairment and dementia among older individuals. To date, limited information is available regarding the neuroimaging signatures associated with performance on the scale, or the relationship between the MoCA and more comprehensive cognitive screening measures. The present study examined performances on the MoCA among 111 non-clinical older adults (ages 51-85) enrolled in a prospective study of cognitive aging. Participants were administered the MoCA, Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). A subset of participants (N = 69) underwent structural 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to define the volumes of total frontal gray matter, total hippocampus, T2-weighted subcortical hyperintensities (SH), and total brain volume. The results revealed significant correlations between the total score on the MoCA and total score on the RBANS and MMSE, though the strength of the correlations was more robust between the MoCA and the RBANS. Modest correlations between individual subscales of the MoCA and neuroimaging variables were evident, but no patterns of shared variance emerged between the MoCA total score and neuroimaging indices. In contrast, total brain volume correlated significantly with total score on the RBANS. These results suggest that additional studies are needed to define the significance of MoCA scores relative to brain integrity among an older population."
"21418960","[A follow-up study on cognitive changes of mild cognitive impairment in the elderly].","OBJECTIVE: To observe and assess the cognitive changes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the elderly.METHODS: A cohort study design was conducted among 47 patients with MCI and 21 control selected from the same convalescent camp, Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), mini mental state examination (MMSE) and clock drawing test (CDT) were performed to all subjects at the onset of study and 12 months later.RESULTS: The score of MMSE, CDT, MoCA and its subitems including visuospatial skill and delayed recall of MCI group were lower than the baseline after 12 months, with significantly decline in the score of MoCA (P = 0.041) and delay recall (P = 0.003). There was no obvious difference in the score of control between the baseline and that after 12 months.CONCLUSION: The decline of delayed recall occurred early and significantly, which may be a predictor in the conversion of mild cognitive impairment to dementia."
"21389719","Clock drawing in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment: recommendations for dementia assessment.","BACKGROUND: Clock drawing is part of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test but may have administration and scoring limitations. We assessed (1) the reliability of the MoCA clock criteria relative to a published error scoring approach, (2) whether command-only administration could distinguish dementia from cognitively intact individuals and (3) the value of adding a clock copy condition to the MoCA.METHODS: Three novice raters and clocks from dementia and control participants were used to assess the 3 aims.RESULTS: MoCA interrater and intrarater reliability were low (i.e. intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.12-0.31) and required repeat training. Clocks drawn to command classified dementia at chance. Inclusion of a copy condition demonstrated expected dementia subgroup patterns.CONCLUSION: Reliable clock scoring with MoCA criteria requires practice. Supplementing a clock copy to the standard MoCA test (takes &lt;1 min) will improve dementia assessment."
"21365162","Nutritional status in older adults with mild cognitive impairment living in elderly homes in Cairo, Egypt.","OBJECTIVES: To delineate the difference in nutritional risk between older adults with normal cognitive function and mild cognitive impairment living in elderly homes.DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.SETTING: Three elderly homes in Cairo, Egypt.PARTICIPANTS: One hundred twenty older adults; men and women aged 60 years and older.MEASUREMENTS: Comprehensive geriatric assessment was done for every participant to evaluate medical, functional, cognitive and affective aspects. Nutritional status was assessed by using the mini-nutritional assessment (MNA). Nutritional deficit was considered to be present if the individuals were classified as malnourished or at nutritional risk by means of the MNA. The cognitive function was assessed by using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).RESULTS: MCI was identified in 46 (38.3%) of the participants. According to the MNA classification, 58 (48.3%) of the sample study was assessed as well nourished, 49 (40.8%) at risk of malnutrition and 13 (10.8%) as malnourished. Older adults with MCI had significantly higher frequency of being at risk of malnutrition or malnourished than those with normal cognition. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the associations between MCI and nutritional deficit remained significant after adjustment for age, illiteracy, female gender and depression.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that MCI may be associated with nutritional risk, which emphasizes the importance of early identification of nutritional status among individuals with MCI. It remains to be demonstrated whether improvement in nutritional status may improve the cognitive function or delay progression to dementia in these patients."
"21282950","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the mini-mental state examination as screening instruments for cognitive impairment: item analyses and threshold scores.","AIMS: To perform an item analysis of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) versus the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in the prediction of cognitive impairment, and to examine the characteristics of different MoCA threshold scores.METHODS: 135 subjects enrolled in a longitudinal clinicopathologic study were administered the MoCA by a single physician and the MMSE by a trained research assistant. Subjects were classified as cognitively impaired or cognitively normal based on independent neuropsychological testing.RESULTS: 89 subjects were found to be cognitively normal, and 46 cognitively impaired (20 with dementia, 26 with mild cognitive impairment). The MoCA was superior in both sensitivity and specificity to the MMSE, although not all MoCA tasks were of equal predictive value. A MoCA threshold score of 26 had a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 52% in this population. In a population with a 20% prevalence of cognitive impairment, a threshold of 24 was optimal (negative predictive value 96%, positive predictive value 47%).CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests the potential for creating an abbreviated MoCA. For screening in primary care, the MoCA threshold of 26 appears optimal. For testing in a memory disorders clinic, a lower threshold has better predictive value."
"21229776","[Applicability and validity of the Dutch version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (moCA-d) in diagnosing MCI].","OBJECTIVE: The MoCA is a new screening test to detect Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Purpose of this study is validating the Dutch version (MoCA-D).METHOD: We administered the MoCA-D to healthy control subjects and to elderly with MCI or dementia from a memory disorder outpatient clinic and a geriatric (outpatient) clinic (n = 30, 32, 37 respectively, age &gt; or = 60). Neuropsychological testing was part of the standard procedure for patients to diagnose MCI. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values (positive: PPV and negative: NPV) of the MoCA-D were assessed.RESULTS: A significant effect of group was found on MoCA-D total score (F (2.95) =67.9; p &lt; 0.01). With a cutoff score of &lt; or = 25, sensitivity and specificity to detect MCI in relation to healthy controls were 72% and 73%, respectively. PPV and NPV were 84% and 56%, respectively. With a cut-off score of &lt; or = 20, sensitivity to detect dementia in relation to MCI was 100% for severe dementia and 75% for mild dementia. Specificity for dementia was 81%, PPV 94% and NPV 55%.CONCLUSION: The MoCA-D distinguishes between healthy elderly, MCI patients and dementia patients. However, in this study, insufficient sensitivity and poor specificity were found. For the present, applying a broader and flexible screening procedure in order to detect MCI seems a more useful method than the interpretation of one test result in particular."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Chinese (Cantonese) Montreal Cognitive Assessment (CC-MoCA) in patients with SIVD in the Guangdong Province of China.METHODS: 71 SIVD patients and 60 matched controls were recruited for the CC-MoCA, Mini Mental State Examination and executive clock drawing tasks. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analyses were performed to determine optimal sensitivity and specificity of the CC-MoCA total score in differentiating mild vascular dementia (VaD) patients from moderate VaD patients and controls.RESULTS: The mean CC-MoCA scores of the controls, and mild and moderate VaD patients were 25.2  3.8, 16.4  3.7, and 10.0  5.1, respectively. In our study, the optimal cutoff value for the CC-MoCA to be able to differentiate patients with mild VaD from controls is 21/22, and 13/14 to differentiate mild VaD from moderate VaD.CONCLUSION: The CC-MoCA is a useful cognitive screening instrument in SIVD patients."
"23260866","Comparative accuracies of two common screening instruments forclassification of Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, andhealthy aging.","BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the utility and diagnostic accuracy of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in a clinical cohort.METHODS: Three hundred twenty-one AD, 126 MCI, and 140 older adults with healthy cognition (HC) were evaluated using the MMSE, the MoCA, a standardized neuropsychologic battery according to the Consortium to Establish a Registry of Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD-NB), and an informant-based measure of functional impairment, the Dementia Severity Rating Scale (DSRS). Diagnostic accuracy and optimal cut-off scores were calculated for each measure, and a method for converting MoCA to MMSE scores is presented.RESULTS: The MMSE and MoCA offer reasonably good diagnostic and classification accuracy as compared with the more detailed CERAD-NB; however, as a brief cognitive screening measure, the MoCA was more sensitive and had higher classification accuracy for differentiating MCI from HC. Complementing the MMSE or the MoCA with the DSRS significantly improved diagnostic accuracy.CONCLUSION: The findings support recent data indicating that the MoCA is superior to the MMSE as a global assessment tool, particularly in discerning earlier stages of cognitive decline. In addition, we found that overall diagnostic accuracy improves when the MMSE or MoCA is combined with an informant-based functional measure. Finally, we provide a reliable and easy conversion of MoCA to MMSE scores. However, the need for MCI-specific measures is still needed to increase the diagnostic specificity between AD and MCI."
"23150114","Associations between EEG beta power abnormality and diagnosis in cognitive impairment post cerebral infarcts.","Cerebral infarct is a common disease of older adults, which could increase the risk for cognitive impairment and dementia. Electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics were analyzed to investigate the applied value in the assessment of cognitive impairment of the cerebral infarct patients. One hundred ten subjects with cerebral infarcts (including 65 cases of cognitive impairment patients (CI-CI) and 45 cases of cognitive normality patients (CI-NC)) and 110 normal health persons (NC) were recruited between July 2009 and March 2011 at the Department of Neurology. All of the patients were analyzed by EEG within 1 day they were hospitalized. The EEG analysis results were compared with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale (assessed within 2 weeks) with the methods of correlation analysis, clustering analysis, and concordance analysis. The results indicated that CI-CI patients had significantly lower EEG beta power (0.832<U+2009><U+2009>0.203 mcV(2)) relative to the CI-NC group (1.493<U+2009><U+2009>0.271 mcV(2), P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01) or NC group (1.565<U+2009><U+2009>0.345 mcV(2), P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01). Significant negative correlation between the beta power and infarct size (as well as infarct number) was discovered (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.88881 and -0.66498, respectively, both P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). There was a good concordance between K-means clustering algorithm calculating the beta power and MoCA scoring (Kappa<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.851, P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). The preliminary findings suggest that the recognition techniques of EEG hold considerable promise for the assessment of cognitive impairment post cerebral infarcts within 2 weeks and which related to the size of infarcts and number of infarcts."

Although the AQ's validity and diagnostic accuracy has been established, its performance in comparison with other instruments has not. Thirty-nine amnestic mild cognitive impairment cases and 34 Alzheimer disease cases were matched on the basis of age, education, and sex to 73 cognitively normal individuals. The sample had a mean age of 82.547.77 years and a mean education level of 14.612.61 years. The diagnostic accuracy of the CDR Sum of Boxes, Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were compared with the AQ. The AQ correlated strongly with the CDR Sum of Boxes (r=0.79) and demonstrated similar diagnostic accuracy with the MoCA and MMSE. These results suggest that the AQ is comparable with other established informant-based and patient-based measures. "
"23137551","COST: Cognitive State Test, a brief screening battery for Alzheimer disease in illiterate and literate patients.","BACKGROUND: The aim was to develop a brief screening battery, Cognitive State Test (COST), for detecting the presence of dementia in both illiterate and literate patients and to assess its validity and reliability.METHODS: COST is a cognitive screening tool that consists of almost all cognitive domains. It takes 5-7 minutes to administer, and has a maximum score of 30. Data were obtained from 114 healthy volunteers and 74 Alzheimer dementia (AD) patients. Subjects' age divided into two groups: A1: &lt;65 years; and A2: =65 years and their education level divided into three groups: E1: illiterate; E2: 1-5 years; and E3: =6 years. For assessing concurrent validity, total COST score was compared to the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Basic Activities of Daily Living (BADL). Sensitivity and specificity were determined through a discriminant analysis using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Internal consistency was measured using Cronbach's coefficient a.RESULTS: For normal and AD subjects, mean age was 64.99.8 years (50 women and 64 men) and 67.213.2 years (55 women and 19 men), respectively. Schooling ranged from 0-15 years (mean 5.74.2 and 3.33.8 years, respectively), and 21 and 37 subjects were illiterate, respectively. The COST significantly and positively correlated with MMSE and MoCA, and significantly and inversely correlated with CDR, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and BADL. In the E1, E2, and E3 education groups, the optimal cut-off points of COST chosen for diagnosis of AD were 23/24 (sensitivity: 81%, specificity: 99%), 24/25 (sensitivity: 75%, specificity: 86%), and 26/27 (sensitivity: 77%, specificity: 84%), respectively. When illiterate and literate subjects were then pooled, the optimal cut-off score of COST was 24/25, which yielded a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 87%. Reliability of the COST was good (0.86).CONCLUSION: The COST is a valid and reliable screening battery for detection of dementia both in the illiterate and the literate Alzheimer patients."
"23062795","Correlation between cognitive function and the association fibers in patients with Alzheimer's disease using diffusion tensor imaging.","White matter (WM) changes, along with well-characterized cortical abnormalities, occur in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the integrity of WM tracts within association fibers by the use of fractional anisotropy (FA), and the relationship between FA values and cognitive function in patients with AD. Neuropsychological examination and conventional MRI, as well as diffusion tensor imaging, (DTI) were conducted on 12 patients with mild to moderate AD and 18 cognitively healthy volunteers. DTI was performed to measure FA in the bilateral inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) and the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) values were used to evaluate cognitive function and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale was used as a staging tool for dementia severity. FA measures were analyzed and correlated with neuropsychological data. No patient showed any WM tract abnormality on either T1-weighted or T2-weighted MRI. However, the FA values in the bilateral IFOF and SLF and the MoCA scores in patients with AD were significantly decreased (p&lt;0.05) compared to the controls. Furthermore, the decreased FA values in the SLF were positively correlated with cognitive function (MMSE scores - right: r=0.672, p=0.033, left: r=0.919, p&lt;0.01; MoCA values - right: r=0.747, p=0.013, left: r=0.679, p=0.031). Our findings confirmed that the loss of integrity of microstructural WM connectivity has a role in the cognitive decline of patients with AD. The data also suggest that the FA values of the SLF may be used as a clinical marker of cognitive function."

"23009126","The Beijing version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment as a brief screening tool for mild cognitive impairment: a community-based study.","BACKGROUND: A cross-sectional validation study was conducted in several urban and rural communities in Beijing, China, to evaluate the effectiveness of the Beijing version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-BJ) as a screening tool to detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among Chinese older adults.METHODS: The MoCA-BJ and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were administered to 1001 Chinese elderly community dwellers recruited from three different regions (i.e., newly developed, old down-town, and rural areas) in Beijing. Twenty-one of these participants were diagnosed by experienced psychiatrists as having dementia, 115 participants were diagnosed as MCI, and 865 participants were considered to be cognitively normal. To analyze the effectiveness of the MoCA-BJ, we examined its psychometric properties, conducted item analyses, evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the scale, and compared the scale with the MMSE. Demographic and regional differences among our subjects were also taken into consideration.RESULTS: Under the recommended cut-off score of 26, the MoCA-BJ demonstrated an excellent sensitivity of 90.4%, and a fair specificity (31.3%). The MoCA-BJ showed optimal sensitivity (68.7%) and specificity (63.9%) when the cut-off score was lowered to 22. Among all the seven cognitive sub-domains, delayed recall was shown to be the best index to differentiate MCI from the normal controls. Regional differences disappeared when the confounding demographic variables (i.e., age and education) were controlled. Item analysis showed that the internal consistency was relatively low in both naming and sentence repetition tasks, and the diagnostic accuracy was similar between the MoCA-BJ and the MMSE.CONCLUSIONS: In general, the MoCA-BJ is an acceptable tool for MCI screening in both urban and rural regions of Beijing. However, presumably due to the linguistic and cultural differences between the original English version and the Chinese version of the scale, and the lower education level of Chinese older adults, the MoCA-BJ is not much better than the MMSE in detecting MCI, at least for this study sample. Further modifications to several test items of the MoCA-BJ are recommended in order to improve the applicability and effectiveness of the MoCA-BJ in MCI screening among the Chinese population."
"22996789","Applicability of the MoCA-S test in populations with little education in Colombia.","OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to report on the use of the Spanish version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-S) as cognitive screening tool in a population aged 65 to 74<U+2009>years in the Andes Mountains of Colombia, assessing the influence of education, and to examine its test-retest reliability.METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of 150 subjects aged 65 to 74<U+2009>years recruited from older community social centers in Manizales, Colombia. The Leganes Cognitive Test (LCT), a cognitive screening test for populations with low education, was used to exclude those who were likely to have dementia. The associations between the MoCA total score and cognitive domains and education were examined in the total sample and in those likely free of dementia. MoCA-S test-retest reliability was estimated by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between two measurements taken 7<U+2009>days apart.RESULTS: Participants had low levels of formal education (mean years of schooling, 4.8). According to the LCT, the proportion of people screening positive for dementia was 16% (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>24). The mean MoCA-S scores were 16.1/30 among illiterate subjects, 18.2/30 among those with incomplete primary school, and 20.3/30 among those with complete primary school (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). Errors were frequent in the cube and clock drawing, attention-serial subtraction, verbal fluency, and abstraction. Test-retest reliability was high, ICC<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.86, 95% CI (0.76-0.93).CONCLUSION: The MoCA-S has high reliability in low-educated older Colombians, but scores were strongly dependent on years of education. Social and cultural factors must be considered when interpreting MoCA-S given the high error rates on items that depend on the ability to read and write and on culture."

"22923608","Cognitive screening in the acute stroke setting.","BACKGROUND: current literature suggests that two-thirds of patients will have cognitive impairment at 3 months post-stroke. Post-stroke cognitive impairment is associated with impaired function and increased mortality. UK guidelines recommend all patients with stroke have a cognitive assessment within 6 weeks. There is no 'gold standard' cognitive screening tool. The Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) is more sensitive than the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in mild cognitive impairment and for cognitive impairment in the non-acute post-stroke setting and in a Chinese-speaking acute stroke setting.METHODS: a convenience sample of 50 patients, admitted with stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), were screened within 14 days, using the MoCA and the MMSE.RESULTS: the mean MoCA was 21.80 versus a mean MMSE of 26.98; 70% were impaired on the MoCA (cut-off &lt;26) versus 26% on MMSE (cut-off &lt;27). The MoCA could be completed in &lt;10 min in 90% of cases.CONCLUSION: the MoCA is easy and quick to use in the acute stroke setting. Further work is required to determine whether a low score on the MoCA in the acute stroke setting will predict the cognitive and functional status and to explore what the best cut-off should be in an acute post-stroke setting."

White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on brain MRI were visually rated and classified as deep or periventricular WMHs.RESULTS: In NC group, education ( = 0.326) but not age ( = -0.183, p = 0.069), was significantly related to MoCA score. However, while we added two points to the AD patients with less than 6 years education, the effects of education disappeared as compared with those of 7 years of education. For all educational levels, the cutoff value of MoCA for very-mild AD was 22/23 (sensitivity = 82.7%, specificity = 87.6%). No significant differences were found in the areas under the curves that differentiated NC from the patients with AD for MoCA and MMSE (differences = 0.008, p = 0.490), or for MoCA and CASI (differences = 0.023, p = 0.082). Total WMHs, frontal deep and periventricular WMHs were inversely correlated with the attention and delayed-recall subdomain.CONCLUSION: The MoCA is a good clinical tool for screening very-mild stage AD if the educational effects are carefully considered. The correlation between the executive subdomains with the frontal WMHs also makes it a useful tool for detecting subtle WMHs."

The aim of the present study was to validate the MoCA as a cognitive screening test for behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bv-FTD) by examining its psychometric properties and diagnostic accuracy. Three matched subgroups of participants were considered: bv-FTD (n = 50), Alzheimer disease (n = 50), and a control group of healthy adults (n = 50). Compared with the MMSE, the MoCA demonstrated consistently superior psychometric properties and discriminant capacity, providing comprehensive information about the patients' cognitive profiles. The diagnostic accuracy of MoCA for bv-FTD was extremely high (area under the curve AUC [MoCA] = 0.934, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.866-.974; AUC [MMSE] = 0.772, 95% CI = 0.677-0.850). With a cutoff below 17 points, the MoCA results for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and classification accuracy were significantly superior to those of the MMSE.

Our objective was to investigate the reliability of two German MoCA alternate forms for longitudinal assessment applications.METHODS: The original and one of two alternate forms of the MoCA were administered within a 60-min interval of a clinical interview in a counterbalanced order to 100 healthy elderly controls, 30 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 30 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The diagnosis of the majority of patients was supported by in vivo AD pathology biomarkers.RESULTS: There was a strong correlation between the alternate forms and the original MoCA in all groups, but particularly in the clinical samples. Total mean scores did not differ significantly between the MoCA versions, even taking into account the presentation order. As in previous studies, age and education influenced performance in the MoCA. The same pattern of group differences (controls &gt; MCI &gt; AD) was observed for each of the versions.CONCLUSION: All three forms can be reliably and interchangeably used in serial cognitive assessment, confirming the MoCA's applicability in research and clinical longitudinal approaches."
"22698956","Comparison of the Saint Louis University Mental Status Examination, the Mini-Mental State Examination, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in detection of cognitive impairment in Chinese elderly from the geriatric department.","INTRODUCTION: The Saint Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS) examination is a popular screening scale for cognitive impairment in North America but has not been studied in Chinese populations. The aim of this study is to compare consistency of the SLUMS with the Chinese version of Mini-Mental Status Examination (CMMSE) and the Beijing version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-B) in Chinese elderly.METHODS: Two hundred seventy-eight Chinese elderly with chronic diseases and geriatric syndromes from the geriatrics department were screened for cognitive impairment, including dementia and mild cognitive impairment, using SLUMS, CMMSE, and MoCA-B. The modified education level cutoff in the diagnostic criteria of SLUMS (mSLUMS) was explored. Scores of the scales and classifications for cognitive status by them were compared using Spearman and <U+03BA> statistics, respectively.RESULTS: Spearman correlation coefficient between scores of the scales were 0.747 (SLUMS vs CMMSE, P&lt;.001), 0.839 (SLUMS vs MoCA-B, P &lt; .001), and 0.773 (CMMSE vs MoCA-B, P &lt; .001). For detection of dementia, <U+03BA> values were 0.462 (SLUMS vs CMMSE, P &lt; .000) and 0.484 (mSLUMS vs CMMSE, P &lt; .000). For mild cognitive impairment, <U+03BA> values were 0.123 (SLUMS vs CMMSE plus MoCA-B in parallel, P= .089) and 0.148 (mSLUMS vs CMMSE plus MoCA-B in parallel, P= .031). For all cognitive impairment, <U+03BA> values were 0.562 (SLUMS vs MoCA-B, P &lt; .000) and 0.650 (SLUMS vs MoCA-B, P &lt; .000).CONCLUSION: Findings from our study indicate that the scores of SLUMS are fairly consistent with MoCA-B and CMMSE in Chinese elderly. Discrepancies of classifications for cognitive status by SLUMS and the other 2 scales implies that further work is needed to explore optimal cutoffs of SLUMS for screening mild cognitive impairment and dementia in elderly Chinese."
"22698678","Cross-cultural difference and validation of the Chinese version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment in older adults residing in Eastern China: preliminary findings.","To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Chinese Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-C) and assess cross-cultural differences in a community-based cohort residing in the Eastern China. The study included 72 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 84 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 146 cognitively normal controls. Sensitivities and specificities were calculated using the recommended cut-off scores. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to determine optimal sensitivity and specificity. Criterion validity, inter-rater, test-retest reliability and internal consistencies of the MoCA-C were examined, and clinical observations made. The influence of age, education level and gender on MoCA score was examined. Using the recommended cut-off score of 26, the area under the ROC (AUC) for predicting MCI groups using the MoCA-C was 0.930 (95%CI: 0.894; 0.965). The MoCA-C demonstrated 92% sensitivity and 85% specificity in screening for MCI. Cultural differences from the original MoCA affected the test response rate. The MoCA-C appears to have utility as a cognitive screen for early detection of AD and for MCI and warrants further investigation regarding its applicability in primary care settings in elderly Chinese people. It will be necessary to revise the contents of the questionnaire to account for by local characteristics."
"22687278","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment is superior to the Mini-Mental State Examination in detecting patients at higher risk of dementia.","BACKGROUND: To examine the discriminant validity of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in detecting patients with cognitive impairment at higher risk for dementia at a memory clinic setting.METHODS: Memory clinic patients were administered the MoCA, MMSE, and a comprehensive formal neuropsychological battery. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subtypes were dichotomized into two groups: single domain-MCI (sd-MCI) and multiple domain-MCI (md-MCI). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to compare the discriminatory ability of the MoCA and the MMSE.RESULTS: Two hundred thirty patients were recruited, of which 136 (59.1%) were diagnosed with dementia, 61 (26.5%) with MCI, and 33 (14.3%) with no cognitive impairment (NCI). The majority of MCI patients had md-MCI (n = 36, 59%). The MoCA had significantly larger AUCs than the MMSE in discriminating md-MCI from the lower risk group for incident dementia (NCI and sd-MCI) [MoCA 0.92 (95% CI, 0.86-0.98) vs. MMSE 0.84 (95% CI, 0.75-0.92), p = 0.02). At their optimal cut-off points, the MoCA (19/20) remained superior to the MMSE (23/24) in detecting md-MCI [sensitivity: 0.83 vs. 0.72; specificity: 0.86 vs. 0.83; PPV: 0.79 vs. 0.72; NPV: 0.89 vs. 0.83; correctly classified: 85.1% vs. 78.7%].CONCLUSION: The MoCA is superior to the MMSE in the detection of patients with cognitive impairment at higher risk for incident dementia at a memory clinic setting."
"22676901","Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA): validation study for vascular dementia.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a brief instrument developed for the screening of milder forms of cognitive impairment, having surpassed the well-known limitations of the MMSE. The aim of the present study was to validate the MoCA as well as its short version, which was proposed by the NINDS-CSN VCI Harmonization Standards for screening Vascular Dementia (VaD) patients. The results, based on a homogeneous sample of 34 VaD patients, indicate that the MoCA is a psychometrically valid and reliable instrument for cognitive screening in VaD patients, showing excellent discriminant validity. Both the full and short versions of the MoCA had excellent diagnostic accuracy in discriminating VaD patients, exhibiting an area under curve (AUC) higher than the MMSE [AUC(MoCA full version) = .950; 95% IC = .868-.988; AUC(MoCA short version) = .936; 95% IC = .849-.981; AUC(MMSE) = .860; 95% IC = .754-.932]. With a cutoff below 17 on the MoCA full version and 8 on the short version, the results for sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and classification accuracy were superior compared to the MMSE. In conclusion, both versions of the MoCA are valid, reliable, sensitive and accurate screening instruments for VaD patients."
"22581594","Clinical application of the Polish adaptation of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test in screening for cognitive impairment.","MATERIAL AND METHODS: A group of 115 subjects (36 meeting DSM-IV criteria for Alzheimer disease (AD) [Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) = 1], 42 meeting Petersen's criteria for MCI [CDR = 0.5], and 37 cognitively intact controls [CDR = 0]) was recruited for the study in the university-based Alzheimer out-patient clinic. All participants underwent general medical, neurological, and psychiatric examinations. The MoCA, the MMSE, CDR and the short (15-item) version of the Geriatric Depression Scale were also applied.RESULTS: Both MCI and AD groups exhibited impaired performance on MoCA compared to controls. Polish versions of the MMSE and MoCA tests were comparable in discriminating mild dementia from both MCI and control groups. The Polish version of the MoCA test performed marginally better than MMSE in discriminating MCI from controls. We propose to use the MoCA test to screen for MCI using an optimal cut-off score of 24 and to screen for dementia using a cut-off score of 19.CONCLUSIONS: The Polish version of the MoCA seems effective in the detection of deteriorated cognitive performance and appropriate for differentiating impaired from preserved cognitive function in a Polish population."
"22522445","Symptoms of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are associated with cholinergic denervation in Parkinson disease.","OBJECTIVE: Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is common in Parkinson disease (PD), but its relationship to the varied neurotransmitter deficits of PD and prognostic significance remain incompletely understood. RBD and cholinergic system degeneration are identified independently as risk factors for cognitive impairment in PD. We aimed to assess the association between cholinergic denervation and symptoms of RBD in PD patients without dementia.METHODS: Eighty subjects with PD without dementia (age, 64.6  7.0 years; range, 50-82 years; 60 males, 20 females; mean Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test [MoCA] score, 26.2  2.1; range 21-30) underwent clinical assessment, neuropsychological testing, and [(11)C]methylpiperidyl propionate acetylcholinesterase and [(11)C]dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ) vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. (11)C3-Amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethyl-phenylsulfaryl)-benzonitrile (DASB) serotonin transporter PET imaging was performed in a subset of 35 subjects. The presence of RBD symptoms was determined using the Mayo Sleep Questionnaire.RESULTS: Twenty-seven of 80 subjects (33.8%) indicated a history of RBD symptoms. Subjects with and without RBD symptoms showed no significant differences in age, motor disease duration, MoCA, Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale motor scores, or striatal DTBZ binding. Subjects with RBD symptoms, in comparison to those without, exhibited decreased neocortical, limbic cortical, and thalamic cholinergic innervation (0.0213  0.0018 vs 0.0236  0.0022, t = 4.55, p &lt; 0.0001; 0.0388  0.0029 vs 0.0423  0.0058, t = 2.85, p = 0.0056; 0.0388  0.0025 vs 0.0427  0.0042, t = 4.49, p &lt; 0.0001, respectively). Brainstem and striatal DASB binding showed no significant differences between groups.INTERPRETATION: The presence of RBD symptoms in PD is associated with relative neocortical, limbic cortical, and thalamic cholinergic denervation although not with differential serotoninergic or nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation. The presence of RBD symptoms may signal cholinergic system degeneration."

Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), mini mental state examination (MMSE) and clock drawing test (CDT) were performed for all subjects at the onset of study and repeated annually.RESULTS: At Month 12, the visuospatial skill scores of MCI patients decreased significantly versus those of the control (0.6  0.7 vs 0.1  0.6, P = 0.008). No one progressed to AD in neither groups. And at Month 24, both visuospatial skill scores (0.9  0.9 vs 0.4  0.9) and attention scores (1.0  1.0 vs 0.2  0.8) of MCI patients declined significantly versus the control (P = 0.021, 0.001). Among 47 MCI patients, 7 progressed to AD. No obvious difference existed in the score of all items between the AD converters and non-converters at baseline. However, the scores of MMSE (27.6  0.8 vs 28.9  1.0), MoCA (24.3  3.1 vs 27.9  1.6) and such MoCA subitems as visuospatial skill (3.9  0.7 vs 4.5  0.6), language (1.86  0.38 vs 2.65  0.53) and delayed recall (2.1  1.5 vs 3.9  1.0) of the converters were obviously lower than those of the non-converters at Month 12 (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, all other scores of the AD converters, except for designation and abstract, were significantly lower than those of the non-converters at Month 24 (P &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: The visuospatial skill, executive function, delayed recall and language function of MCI patients progressing to AD tend to have early impairment and significant changes. It may be useful to predict AD among the MCI patients."
"22353375","Cognitive and affective impairments of a novel SCA/MND crossroad mutation Asidan.","BACKGROUND: A variety of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) develops a broad spectrum of both ataxia and non-ataxia symptoms. Cognitive and affective changes are one such non-ataxia symptoms, but have been described only in hereditary SCAs with exonic CAG gene expansion.METHODS: We newly found intronic hexanucleotide GGCCTG gene expansion in NOP56 gene as the causative mutation (=SCA36) in nine unrelated Japanese familial SCA originating from Asida river area in the western part of Japan, thus nicknamed Asidan for this mutation. These patients show unique clinical balance of cerebellar ataxia and motor neuron disease (MND), locating on the crossroad of these two diseases. In the nine families, 14 patients were clinically examined and genetically confirmed to Asidan. In the present study, we examined cognitive and affective analyses on 12 patients (seven men and five women) who agreed to join the examination with average age at onset of 53.1  3.2 years, average duration of 12.1  5.2 years, and current average age at 65.1  6.2 years.RESULTS: The 12 Asidan patients demonstrated a significant decrease in their frontal executive functions measured by frontal assessment battery (FAB) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) compared with age- and gender-matched controls, whilst mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Hasegawa dementia score-revised (HDS-R) were within normal range. The decline of frontal executive function was related to their disease duration and scale for the assessment and rating of ataxias (SARA). They also demonstrated mild depression and apathy. Single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) analysis showed that these Asidan patients showed decline of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in a particular areas of cerebral cortices such as Brodmann areas 24 and 44-46.CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the patients with Asidan mutation show unique cognitive and affective characteristics different from other hereditary SCAs with exonal CAG expansion or MND."
"22306380","Suitability of the Montreal cognitive assessment versus the mini-mental state examination in detecting vascular cognitive impairment.","The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) has been criticized as being an insufficient screening test for patients with vascular cognitive impairment because of its insensitivity to visuospatial and executive functional deficits. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was designed to be more sensitive to such deficits, and thus may be a superior screening instrument for vascular cognitive impairment. Twelve patients with extensive leukoaraiosis detected on magnetic resonance imaging (average age, 76.0  8.7 years) underwent neurologic and cognitive testing, including MMSE and the Japanese version of the MoCA (MoCA-J). Accepted cutoff scores of &lt;27 for the MMSE and &lt;26 for the MoCA-J were taken to indicate cognitive impairment. Z-scores were calculated to evaluate the discriminating ability of individual MMSE and MoCA-J subtest scores. Although there was a strong correlation between the total MMSE and total MoCA-J scores (r = 0.90; P &lt; .0001), MMSE scores were skewed toward the higher end of the range (range, 18-30; median, 28), whereas MoCA-J scores were normally distributed (range, 9-28; median, 21). Of the 7 patients with an unimpaired MMSE score, 6 (86%) had an impaired MoCA-J score. Z-scores were &gt;5 for 4 MMSE subtests (orientation, registration, naming, and language) but for only 1 MoCA-J subtest (naming). The MoCA-J better discriminated cognitive status in subjects with extensive leukoaraiosis. Our findings suggest that the MoCA-J is more sensitive than the MMSE in screening for cognitive impairment in patients with subcortical vascular cognitive impairment. "

Sample consisted of 49 participants diagnosed with dementia of the Alzheimer's type (AD) according to DSM-IV criteria and 49 normal controls (NC) aged =50 years. All subjects were administered the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and MoCA Sinhala version (MoCA-S). Concurrent validity was assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients between the MoCA-S scores and MMSE scores. Criterion validity was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.RESULTS: Mean MoCA scores between NC (26.71, SD 2.4) and AD group (16.78, SD 5.9) were significantly different (t=10.8, p&lt;0.001). Cronbach's alpha of 0.818 indicated good internal consistency. Attention (digit span, sustained attention, and the serial 7 calculation task) had the highest discriminant ability followed by visuospatial skills (trail making, cube drawing and clock drawing). Naming had poor discriminant ability. There was a high, positive correlation between MoCA-S total scores and MMSE total scores. (r=0.907, p&lt;0.001). The area under the ROC curve was 0.975 (95%CI 0.94-1.0) for the MoCA and 0.928 (95% CI 0.87-0.98) for MMSE.

"22277128","Montreal Cognitive Assessment: influence of sociodemographic and health variables.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a brief cognitive instrument for screening milder forms of cognitive impairment. The present study aimed to analyze the influence of sociodemographic (age, gender, educational level, marital and employment status, geographic region, geographic localization, and residence area) and health variables (subjective memory complaints of the participant and evaluated by the informant, depressive symptoms, and family history of dementia) on the participants' performance on the MoCA. The investigation was carried out in a Portuguese community-based sample of 650 cognitively healthy adults, who were representative of the distribution observed in the Portuguese population. Educational level and age significantly contributed to the prediction of the MoCA scores, explaining 49% of the variance. Regarding health variables, only the subjective memory complaints of the participant showed a small contribution (9%) to the variance on the MoCA scores. This study contributes a useful approach to understanding MoCA performance, stressing the great impact of education and age on scores."

"24348502","Reliability and Validity of the Clinical Dementia Rating for Community-Living Elderly Subjects without an Informant.","BACKGROUND: The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale is widely used to assess cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease. It requires collateral information from a reliable informant who is not available in many instances. We adapted the original CDR scale for use with elderly subjects without an informant (CDR-NI) and evaluated its reliability and validity for assessing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia among community-dwelling elderly subjects.METHOD: At two consecutive visits 1 week apart, nurses trained in CDR assessment interviewed, observed and rated cognitive and functional performance according to a protocol in 90 elderly subjects with suboptimal cognitive performance [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) &lt;26 and/or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) &lt;26] and without informants according to a protocol. CDR domains and global scores were assigned after the second visit based upon corroborative information from the subjects' responses to questions, role-play, and observed performance in specifically assigned tasks at home and within the community.RESULTS: The CDR-NI scores (0, 0.5, 1) showed good internal consistency (Crohnbach's a 0.83-0.84), inter-rater reliability (<U+03BA> 0.77-1.00 for six domains and 0.95 for global rating) and test-retest reliability (<U+03BA> 0.75-1.00 for six domains and 0.80 for global rating), good agreement (<U+03BA> 0.79) with the clinical assessment status of MCI (n = 37) and dementia (n = 4) and significant differences in the mean scores for MMSE, MOCA and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ANOVA global p &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSION: Owing to the protocol of the interviews, assessments and structured observations gathered during the two visits, CDR-NI provides valid and reliable assessment of MCI and dementia in community-living elderly subjects without an informant."

It is unclear whether the burden of underlying -amyloid pathology is associated with language or general cognitive impairment in these subjects.METHODS: The relationship between cortical -amyloid burden on [(11) C]Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) and performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Wechsler Memory Scale - Third Edition (WMS-III), the Boston Naming Test (BNT) and the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) was assessed using regression and correlation analyses in subjects presenting with aphasia who showed -amyloid deposition on PiB PET.RESULTS: The global PiB ratio was inversely correlated with MoCA (P=0.02) and the WMS-III Visual Reproduction (VR) subtest (VR I, P=0.02; VR II, P=0.04). However, the correlations between PiB ratio, BNT (P=0.13), WAB aphasia quotient (P=0.11) and WAB repetition scores (P=0.34) were not significant.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that an increased cortical -amyloid burden is associated with cognitive impairment, but not language deficits, in AD subjects presenting with aphasia. The results suggest that -amyloid deposition could be partly contributing to impaired cognition in such patients whilst language dysfunction may be more influenced by other pathological mechanisms, perhaps downstream pathways of -amyloid deposition."

Criterion validity was supported, with MoCA subscores according to cognitive domain correlating well with analogous neuropsychological tests and, in the case of memory (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)=0.86), executive (AUC=0.79), and visuospatial function (AUC=0.79), being reasonably sensitive to impairment in those domains.CONCLUSION: The MoCA is a valid assessment of cognition that shows good agreement with existing screening tools and global measures (convergent validity) and was superior to the MMSE in this regard. The MoCA domain-specific subscores align with performance on more-detailed neuropsychological tests, suggesting not only good criterion validity for the MoCA, but also that it may be useful in guiding further neuropsychological testing."
"24276096","Effectiveness of Montreal Cognitive Assessment for the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease in Singapore.","INTRODUCTION: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an important clinical entity with significant management implications. However, traditional screening tools lack the sensitivity needed to detect amnestic MCI (MCI-A). Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has yet to be validated for the diagnosis of MCI in a multiracial society such as Singapore. We thus aimed to study the effectiveness of MoCA for the diagnosis of MCI-A in the Singapore population.METHODS: Data on patients with MCI-A and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) was obtained from a prospectively collected clinical database between January 2008 and January 2011. Patients with no cognitive impairment (NCI) were recruited from among the spouses and friends of patients attending the memory clinic.RESULTS: There were a total of 212 participants (103 NCI, 49 MCI-A, 60 mild AD). For the diagnosis of MCI-A, a MoCA score of &lt; 26 for patients with = 10 years of education, and a score of &lt; 27 for patients with &gt; 10 years of education provided a sensitivity of &gt; 94%. For the diagnosis of mild AD, a MoCA score of &lt; 24 for patients with = 10 years of education, and a score of &lt; 25 for patients with &gt; 10 years of education provided a sensitivity of &gt; 85%.CONCLUSION: In the Singapore population, we recommend cutoff scores of 26/27 and 24/25 be used to detect MCI-A and mild AD, respectively, when using MoCA. For patients with = 10 years of education, a +1 point correction is needed."
"24217342","Impact of different operational definitions on mild cognitive impairment rate and MMSE and MoCA performance in transient ischaemic attack and stroke.","BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is at least as prevalent as dementia after transient ischaemic attack (TIA)/stroke and is increasingly recognised as an important outcome in observational studies and randomised trials. However, there is no consensus on how impairment should be defined, and numerous different criteria exist. Previous studies have shown that different criteria for cognitive impairment impact on prevalence rates in epidemiological studies. However, there are few data on how operational differences within established criteria (e.g. Petersen-MCI) affect measured impairment rates and the performance of short cognitive tests such as the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), particularly in cerebrovascular disease. We therefore evaluated the effect of different operational definitions on measured rates of Petersen-MCI and on reliability of short cognitive tests in patients with TIA and stroke.METHODS: Consecutive patients underwent the MMSE, MoCA and neuropsychological battery =1 year after TIA or stroke in a population-based study. MCI was defined using the Petersen method and subclassified as single or multiple domain, both with (original) and without (modified) subjective memory impairment. Different cut-offs (&gt;1, &gt;1.5 and &gt;2 standard deviations, SD) on a given test relative to published norms were compared together with use of single versus multiple tests to define domain impairment.RESULTS: 91 non-demented subjects completed neuropsychological testing (mean age  SD 69.7  11.6 years, 54 male, 49 stroke) at a mean of 3.1  1.9 years after the index event. Rates of cognitive impairment ranged from 14/91 (15%) for MCI-original at &gt;2 SD cut-off to 61/91 (67%) MCI-modified at &gt;1 SD cut-off, and the proportion of MCI that was multiple domain varied, e.g. 24/46 (52%) versus only 5/27 (20%) at 1 versus 2 SD cut-off for MCI-modified. Requirement for subjective memory complaint approximately halved estimates [e.g. 17 (19%) vs. 39 (43%) for MCI at 1.5 SD cut-off, single test definition], whereas use of multiple tests versus a single test to define a cognitive domain had less impact. In general, diagnostic accuracy was higher, and optimal cut-offs lower, on MMSE and MoCA for multiple-domain versus single-domain MCI, but the MoCA appeared superior for detecting MCI-modified, whereas the MMSE performed well in detecting MCI-original.CONCLUSION: Even within established criteria for MCI, differences in operational methodology result in 4-fold variation in MCI estimates. Optimal MMSE and MoCA cut-offs are lower, and reliability more similar, when criteria for MCI are more stringent. Our findings have implications for sample size and adjusted relative risk calculations in randomised trials and for comparisons between studies."
"24107412","Evidence of the sensitivity of the MoCA alternate forms in monitoring cognitive change in early Alzheimer's disease.","AIMS: There is an increasing interest in using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test as a monitoring tool in Alzheimer's disease (AD) in both research and clinical settings. Our aim was to investigate the utility of alternate forms of the MoCA in detecting cognitive deterioration in a sample of early AD patients followed longitudinally in an outpatient memory clinic.METHOD: Twenty-five patients with early-stage AD (prodromal or mild dementia) were administered the original version and one of two previously validated alternate forms of the MoCA within an interval of about 1 year. The decline over time and the rate of change of the MoCA were compared to the total score of a standardized neuropsychological assessment battery (Consortium to Establish a Registry of Alzheimer's Disease; CERAD-Plus). Responsiveness to change was determined by calculating standard response means and the respective effect sizes.RESULTS: Sixty percent of the sample showed a clinical decline on the clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale. There was significant deterioration in the MoCA and CERAD total scores.CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that the MoCA is capable of detecting change over time and seems to be a valid tool with small to moderate sensitivity for monitoring cognitive change in early AD."
"24081441","Memory, mood, and vitamin D in persons with Parkinson's disease.","BACKGROUND: Research in recent years has suggested a role of vitamin D in the central nervous system. The final converting enzyme and the vitamin D receptor are found throughout the human brain. From animal studies vitamin D appears important in neurodevelopment, up-regulation of neurotrophic factors, stabilization of mitochondrial function, and antioxidation.OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between serum vitamin D and neuropsychiatric function in persons with Parkinson's disease (PD).METHODS: This is an add-on study to a longitudinal study following neuropsychiatric function in persons with PD. Baseline neuropsychiatric performance and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D were examined for 286 participants with PD. Measures of global cognitive function (MMSE, MOCA, Mattis Dementia Scale), verbal memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test), fluency (animals, vegetables, and FAS words), visuospatial function (Benton Line Orientation), executive function (Trails Making Test and Digit-Symbol Substitution), PD severity (Hoehn &amp; Yahr and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) and depression (Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)) were administered. Multivariate linear regression assessed the association between vitamin D concentration and neuropsychiatric function, in the entire cohort as well as the non-demented and demented subsets.RESULTS: Using a multivariate model, higher vitamin D concentrations were associated with better performance on numerous neuropsychiatric tests in the non-demented subset of the cohort. Significant associations were specifically found between vitamin D concentration and verbal fluency and verbal memory (t = 4.31, p &lt; 0.001 and t = 3.04, p = 0.0083). Vitamin D concentrations also correlated with depression scores (t = -3.08, p = 0.0083) in the non-demented subset.CONCLUSIONS: Higher plasma vitamin D is associated with better cognition and better mood in this sample of PD patients without dementia. Determination of causation will require a vitamin D intervention study."
"24054341","Mild cognitive impairment, screening, and patient perceptions in heart failure patients.","OBJECTIVE: Cognitive impairments are prevalent in heart failure (HF) patients, worsening outcomes but often undetected.The aim of this study was to screen HF outpatients for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), determine the areas of cognition affected, patient awareness of cognitive change, and associated factors.METHOD AND RESULTS: HF patients (n= 128) newly registered for the Management of Cardiac Function program, free from neurocognitive disorder, and with sufficient visual acuity were assessed with the use of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment tool (MoCA). MCI was classified as MoCA score =22. The sample was elderly (mean, 80.65 years; SD, 11.52). Mean MoCA score was 24.58 (SD 3.45), 22% were classified as impaired, 45% had noticed a change in cognition, and 15% reported that they were affected in their daily lives. Patients noticing this impact had lower MoCA scores (22.74, SD 3.0) than those who did not (25.17, SD 2.96; P = .02). Most impairments occurred for delayed recall, visuospatial/executive function, and abstraction. The odds of impairment increased by the presence of ischemic heart disease (odds ratio, 4.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-15.69).CONCLUSIONS: In HF outpatients without a dementia diagnosis, MCI is prevalent. Screening for MCI and incorporation of compensatory strategies are essential."
"24051120","Polysomnographic abnormalities in patients with vascular cognitive impairment-no dementia.","OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate subjective sleep quality and polysomnographic sleep structure features in patients with vascular cognitive impairment-no dementia (VCIND).METHODS: Fifty-six patients with VCIND, 48 patients with simple stroke (without cognitive impairment), and 48 control subjects were included. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and polysomnography (PSG) were used to analyze their sleep characteristics. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was conducted to assess mental state.RESULTS: Patients with VCIND had higher PSQI scores compared with control subjects and simple stroke patients (P&lt;.01). PSG revealed that patients with VCIND or stroke were more likely to experience prolonged sleep latency (SL), decreased sleep efficiency (SE), increased arousal, and reduced deep sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep than controls. Patients with VCIND had significantly longer SL, increased periodic leg movements in sleep (PLMS), decreased SE, and increased arousal and sleep fragmentation compared to patients with simple stroke (P&lt;.05). In VCIND patients, a significant positive correlation was found between SE and MoCA scores (r=0.632; P&lt;.001), though PSQI, SL, and arousal index were significantly negatively associated with MoCA scores (r=-0.787, -0.740, -0.772, respectively; P&lt;.001 for all).CONCLUSIONS: VCIND patients had different abnormal sleep features, including decreased SE, increased PLMS, and prolonged SL and sleep fragmentation. Abnormal sleep in VCIND may be associated with cognitive impairment."
"23986293","Electroencephalogram global field synchronization analysis: a new method for assessing the progress of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Global field synchronization (GFS) can measure functional synchronization in frequency-domain electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The aim of this study is to explore GFS values and its clinical significance for severity of cognitive decline in AD. EEGs were recorded from 37 AD patients and 37 age-matched healthy individuals. GFS values were calculated in delta, theta, alpha, beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, gamma, and full frequency bands. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) were employed to assess symptom severity in AD patients. Correlation analysis, clustering analysis, and concordance analysis were performed to analyze the relationship between GFS values and MoCA scores in AD patients. GFS values of the beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, and full bands were lower in AD patients than in healthy individuals, and positively correlated with MoCA and CDR scores in the combined group (AD patients and healthy individuals). GFS values were positively correlated with MoCA socres in 3 beta bands and full bands, and with CDR scores in the delta band. There was a good concordance between K-means clustering algorithm calculating of GFS values and MoCA scoring (<U+03BA> = .913, P &lt; .001). In conclusion, the present results indicated that GFS can serve as an indicator of cognitive decline or impairment in AD patients. Furthermore, the GFS method of EEG holds considerable promise to distinguish mild cognitive impairment from serious cognitive impairment in patients with AD. "
"23968941","Correcting the MoCA for education: effect on sensitivity.","OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to quantify the impact of the suggested education correction on the sensitivity and specificity of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).METHOD: Twenty-five outpatients with dementia and 39 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) underwent a diagnostic evaluation, which included the MoCA. Thirty-seven healthy controls also completed the MoCA and psychiatric, medical, neurological, functional, and cognitive difficulties were ruled out.RESULTS: For the total MoCA score, unadjusted for education, a cut-off score of 26 yielded the best balance between sensitivity and specificity (80% and 89% respectively) in identifying cognitive impairment (people with either dementia or aMCI, versus controls). When applying the education correction, sensitivity decreased from 80% to 69% for a small specificity increase (89% to 92%). The cut-off score yielding the best balance between sensitivity and specificity for the education adjusted MoCA score fell to 25 (61% and 97%, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Adjusting the MoCA total score for education had a detrimental effect on sensitivity with only a slight increase in specificity. Clinically, this loss in sensitivity can lead to an increased number of false negatives, as education level does not always correlate to premorbid intellectual function. Clinical judgment about premorbid status should guide interpretation. However, as this effect may be cohort specific, age and education corrected norms and cut-offs should be developed to help guide MoCA interpretation."
"23936778","Montreal Cognitive Assessment is superior to Standardized Mini-Mental Status Exam in detecting mild cognitive impairment in the middle-aged and elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","AIM: This study compares the usefulness of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to Standardized Mini-Mental Status Exam (SMMSE) for diagnosing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) population.METHODS: This prospective pilot study enrolled 30 community dwelling adults with Type 2 DM aged 50 years and above. Subjects were assessed using both the SMMSE and MoCA for MCI. In all subjects, depression and dementia were ruled out using the DSM IV criteria, and a functional assessment was done. MCI was diagnosed using the standard test, the European consortium criteria. Sensitivity and specificity analysis, positive and negative predictive values, likelihood ratios and Kappa statistic were calculated.RESULTS: In comparison to consortium criteria, the sensitivity and specificity of MoCA were 67% and 93% in identifying individuals with MCI, and SMMSE were 13% and 93%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values for MoCA were 84% and 56%, and for SMMSE were 66% and 51%, respectively. Kappa statistics showed moderate agreement between MoCA and consortium criteria (kappa = 0.4) and a low agreement between SMMSE and consortium criteria (kappa = 0.07).CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, MoCA appears to be a better screening tool than SMMSE for MCI in the diabetic population."
"23920318","Validity and applications of the Montreal cognitive assessment for the assessment of vascular cognitive impairment.","Cognitive impairment is common among patients with stroke or other cerebrovascular disease and influences long-term outcome, including occupational functioning. Recognition and monitoring of mild cognitive impairment is thus essential to good patient care. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has been suggested as a brief screening test of vascular cognitive impairment. This paper presents a critical review of the research literature evaluating the validity and utility of this test with the aim of informing future clinical and research practice. A total of 30 papers employing the MoCA in the context of cerebrovascular disease were identified. Reporting of the methods and results of such studies tended to fall short of the established reporting guidelines. Under-specification of the exclusion criteria applied and their impact make it difficult to assess the potential impact of sampling bias and loss to follow-up. Nevertheless, content validity evidence suggests that the MoCA covers most of the domains that represent cognitive impairment in cerebrovascular disease, with mixed evidence for its preferential sensitivity to the type of cognitive impairment encountered in the context of vascular disease. Evidence clearly supports the need to establish norms and cut-offs for the MoCA that are culturally appropriate and that are matched to the range of cognitive impairment that is present in the population being assessed. Recent modifications of the MoCA have been developed for assessing patients with visual impairment or restricted mobility, which may reduce the impact of 'untestability' on cognitive screening in the clinic or research context. The MoCA correlates well with other measures of cognitive and functional abilities in patients with cerebrovascular disease, and may also predict future response to rehabilitation and long-term occupational outcome. Further research is needed to provide evidence for the validity of the MoCA in longitudinal studies. However, it compares favourably to the Mini Mental State Examination as a screening test that is sensitive to the milder forms of cognitive impairment that often accompany cerebrovascular disease."
"23919950","Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Mini-Mental State Examination performance in patients with mild-to-moderate dementia with Lewy bodies, Alzheimer's disease, and normal participants in Taiwan.","BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine and test the sensitivity, specificity, and threshold scores of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and determine those that best correspond to a clinical diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).METHODS: Sixty-seven Alzheimer's disease (AD), 36 DLB, and 62 healthy participants without dementia (NC), aged 60 to 90, were enrolled. All three groups took the MoCA and MMSE tests at the same time. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests and receiver operating characteristics curve analysis were used to compare the different neuropsychological test results among the groups.RESULTS: The cut-off point of the MoCA for AD was 21/22 with a sensitivity of 95.5% and a specificity of 82.3% (area under the curve (AUC): 0.945), and the cut-off point for DLB was 22/23 with a sensitivity of 91.7% and a specificity of 80.6% (AUC: 0.932). For the MMSE, the cut-off points for AD and for DLB from NC were all 24/25, with a sensitivity of 88.1% and a specificity of 85.5% for AD (AUC: 0.92), and a sensitivity of 77.8% and a specificity of 85.5% for DLB (AUC: 0.895). After controlling sex, age, and education, AD and DLB had lower scores in all MoCA subscales than the NC group (p &lt; 0.05), except for the orientation and naming in DLB. In addition, AD had a lower score in the MoCA orientation (p = 0.03) and short-term memory (p = 0.02) than did DLB.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA is a more sensitive instrument than the MMSE to screen AD or DLB patients from non-dementia cases."
"23912068","Eye Blink Rate as a biological marker of Mild Cognitive Impairment.","We investigated the relationship between dopamine activity (DA), as measured by Eye Blink Rate (EBR), and cognitive function in old adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and healthy controls. Research has been inconclusive so far about the factors responsible for the transition from MCI to dementia. However, some studies suggest that cortical hyperexcitability in very early stages of pathological aging may progressively lead to cell death, and thus to Alzheimer's disease. Hence, we speculated that a dysfunction of DA activity, as measured by EBR, may characterize people with MCI, and account for their poor cognitive function. Thirty three (33) healthy and thirty six (36) old adults with MCI (Mean age = 67.52 y.o.) participated in this study. The EBR was recorded under resting conditions, using two gold skin electrodes above and below the left eye. Cognitive function was assessed with a battery of neuropsychological tests. Participants with MCI showed significantly higher EBR than the healthy controls. Also, EBR was negatively related to scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment test (MoCA) test. We propose that abnormally increased dopamine activity, as indexed by relatively high EBR, may be partially responsible for the neurotransmitter imbalance in the central nervous system of people with MCI, and the overall impaired cognitive performance. In addition, this finding suggests that an abnormally high EBR may be a potential biomarker of the transition from healthy aging to dementia."
"23892706","Cognitive impairment and PD patients' capacity to consent to research.","OBJECTIVE: To examine how cognitive impairment affects Parkinson disease (PD) patients' research consent capacity.METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 90 patients with PD, divided using Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 scores into 3 groups of 30 (normal, borderline, and impaired), and 30 neurologically normal older adults completed 2 capacity interviews (an early-phase randomized and controlled drug trial and a sham-controlled surgical implantation of genetic tissue) using the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Clinical Research. Expert clinicians used the interviews to classify the patients as either capable or not capable of providing their own informed consent. These judgments were compared with performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).RESULTS: Cognitively normal PD patients typically scored well on the capacity measures. In contrast, patients with impaired cognition were not capable of providing their own informed consent: 17% (5/30) on the drug trial and 3% (1/30) on the surgery trial were judged capable. Patients with borderline impairment showed adequate performance on measures of appreciation and reasoning, but impaired performance on understanding the drug trial compared with normal controls and normal PD patients, and on understanding the surgery trial compared with normal controls. Sixty-seven percent (20/30) on the drug trial and 57% (17/30) on the surgery trial were judged capable of consent. Receiver operating characteristic analyses showed that the MMSE and MoCA could detect the likelihood of impaired capacity, with the MoCA demonstrating greater sensitivity.CONCLUSIONS: PD patients with borderline cognitive impairment have impairments in their decisional capacity. The MoCA may be useful to identify the patients at risk of impaired capacity."
"23891119","The effects of educational background on Montreal Cognitive Assessment screening for vascular cognitive impairment, no dementia, caused by ischemic stroke.","It is possible that a patient's educational background has an effect on their Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score, which is used to evaluate patients for vascular cognitive impairment, no dementia (VCIND) after ischemic stroke. Cognitive impairment was evaluated in patients with no cognitive impairment (NCI) or VCIND using the MoCA. The receiver operating characteristic curve and maximal Youden index were used to determine the optimal cut-off values to distinguish between NCI and VCIND. The sensitivity and specificity of MoCA were calculated for patients with primary, secondary and tertiary educational levels. Patients with NCI (n=111) and VCIND (n=95) were tested. In patients with a primary education, a significant difference was found between the two groups in each of the MoCA factors, except for naming. Likewise, a significant difference was found in all factors, except for naming, attention and calculation, for patients with a secondary education. For the patients with a tertiary education, a significant difference was found only in visuospatial/executive abilities, abstraction and memory (p&lt;0.05). The optimal cut-off value for MoCA in order to identify VCIND was 22-23. MoCA showed an overall sensitivity of 65.26% and specificity of 78.73%. The sensitivity in the primary, secondary and tertiary educated groups was 97.06%, 56.10% and 40%, respectively, with the specificity being 47.22%, 87.80% and 100%, respectively. We suggest that the MoCA score needs to be amended according to the patient's educational levels in order to improve the effectiveness of the screening."

Screen-positive participants subsequently underwent MoCA, MMSE, and a comprehensive formal neuropsychological battery. MCI was defined by Petersen's criteria and further classified into single-domain MCI (sd-MCI) and md-MCI. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was computed for the MoCA and the MMSE in detecting md-MCI.RESULTS: A total of 300 participants were recruited: 128 (42.7%) were diagnosed with no cognitive impairment (NCI), 47 (15.7%) with sd-MCI, and 83 (28.0%) with md-MCI. Forty-one participants were excluded, 7 (2.3%) had dementia, and 34 (11.3%) had only objective cognitive impairment without subjective complaints. Although the MoCA had a significantly larger AUC than the MMSE (0.94 (95% CI = 0.91-0.97) vs. 0.91 (95% CI = 0.86-0.95), p= 0.04), at optimal cut-off points, the MoCA (19/20) was equivalent to the MMSE (25/26) in detecting md-MCI (sensitivity: 0.80 vs. 0.87, specificity: 0.92 vs. 0.80).CONCLUSION: Both screening tests had good discriminant validity and can be used in detecting md-MCI in a sub-sample of Chinese drawn from a population-based study."
"23798501","Usefulness of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in Huntington's disease.","BACKGROUND: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a brief screening instrument for dementia that is sensitive to executive dysfunction. This study examined its usefulness for assessing cognitive performance in mild, moderate, and severe Huntington's disease (HD), compared with the use of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).METHODS: We compared MoCA and MMSE total scores and the number of correct answers in 5 cognitive-specific domains in 104 manifest HD patients and 100 matched controls.RESULTS: For the total HD sample, and for the moderate and severe patients, significant differences between both MoCA and MMSE total scores and almost all cognitive-specific domains emerged. Even mild HD subjects showed significant differences with regard to total score and several cognitive domains on both instruments.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the MoCA, although not necessarily superior to the MMSE, is a useful instrument for assessing cognitive performance over a broad level of functioning in HD."
"23738569","Predictors of early post ischemic stroke apathy and depression: a cross-sectional study.","BACKGROUND: Apathy and depression are important neuropsychiatric disorders that can occur after a stroke but the etiology and risk factors are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for apathy and depression following a stroke.METHODS: Patients with an acute stroke who met the inclusion criteria were recruited from our hospital, and general information was recorded from patient charts. The Apathy Evaluation Scale, Clinician Version (AES-C) was used to evaluate these patients within 2weeks after the stroke. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), Mattis Dementia Rating Scale Initiation/Perseveration subset (MDRS I/P), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) and Stroop Color-Word Association Test were employed to evaluate emotion, cognitive function and executive function. The patients were divided into two groups: the apathy group and the non-apathy group. We also divided the patients into two groups based on whether or not they had post-stroke depression. The clinical characteristics and scores on the MoCA, MMSE, HAMD and MDRS I/P were compared between the apathy and non-apathy groups as well as between patients with and without depression. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for apathy and depression following a stroke.RESULTS: A total of 75 patients with acute stroke were recruited. Of these, 25 (33.3%) developed apathy and 12 (16%) developed depression. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that a history of cerebrovascular disease (OR: 6.45, 95% CI: 1.48-28.05, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.013), low HbA1c (OR: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.12-0.81, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.017) and a low MDRS I/P score (OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.74, 0.96, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.010) were risk factors for post-stroke apathy. Additionally, multivariate logistic regression indicated that a low MDRS I/P (OR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.75, 0.97, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.015) was associated with post-stroke depression.CONCLUSIONS: Three risk factors for post-stroke apathy were identified as a history of cerebrovascular disease, low HbA1c and lower MDRS I/P scores. A low MDRS I/P score was also identified as a risk factor for post-stroke depression. These results may be useful to clinicians in recognizing and treating apathy and depression in patients after a stroke."
"23737930","Canadian academy of geriatric psychiatry survey of brief cognitive screening instruments.","BACKGROUND: The use of brief cognitive screening instruments is essential in the assessment of dementia. The purpose of this study is to determine the frequency of use and perceived characteristics of cognitive screening instruments among Canadian psychogeriatric clinicians.METHODS: Members of the Canadian Academy of Geriatric Psychiatry (CAGP) and attendees to the 2010 Annual Scientific Meeting were asked to complete a computerized survey. This survey assessed the perceived characteristics and frequency of use of 14 instruments.RESULTS: The survey had a 55% response rate, with a total of 155 respondents. The most commonly used instruments are the Clock Drawing Test (CDT), Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Delayed Word Recall. Effectiveness, ease of administration, and speed of administration were the perceived characteristics of instruments most correlated with frequency of use.CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with previous surveys, a small number of cognitive screening instruments are used by the majority of clinicians. Use of the CDT and the MMSE were comparable. To our knowledge, this is the first survey demonstrating that the MMSE is not the most commonly used tool, and other, newer instruments like the MoCA, are gaining prominence."
"23716072","Predictive value of MoCA in the acute phase of stroke on the diagnosis of mid-term cognitive impairment.","Post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) includes all forms of cognitive decline that develop after stroke, even if not severe enough to fit the criteria of dementia. Our aims were to investigate the predictive value of a brief bedside examination (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA) in the acute phase of stroke on the diagnosis of mid-term PSCI, taking into account other clinical, cognitive, functional, and neuroimaging predictors. Consecutive patients admitted to a stroke unit were evaluated with MoCA between 5 and 9 days after stroke. At baseline, clinical, functional, and neuroimaging data were collected. Patients were reassessed between 6 and 9 months after stroke by means of an extensive neuropsychological and functional evaluation. Out of 137 enrolled stroke patients, 80 (58.4%) were followed up (mean age 68.2  14.6 years, males 66%, mean NIHSS score 3.6  4.8). PSCI was diagnosed in 47 patients (59%; 35 mild cognitive impairment, 12 dementia). Controlling for age, education, functional and cognitive pre-morbid status, stroke severity, and pre-existing lacunar infarcts, MoCA baseline score [OR (95% CI) = 1.4(1.1-1.8)] for each point] and leukoaraiosis severity [OR (95% CI) = 0.4(0.2-0.9)] for each point of the van Swieten scale] were independently associated with PSCI. Using a ROC analysis, a cut-off of 21 predicted the diagnosis of PSCI with 91.4 % sensitivity, 75.8 % specificity, 80 % positive predictive value, and 89.3 % negative predictive value. In a sample of mild stroke patients, MoCA seems to be a good predictor of mid-term PSCI, making it a possible candidate for a brief cognitive screening in the acute stroke setting."

Those with severe cognitive impairment, dementia, or Parkinson's disease were excluded.MEASUREMENTS: Measurements included height and weight, normal walking speed, Timed Up-and-Go, handgrip strength, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Color Trails Test, and bone mineral density. Normative values were estimated using generalized additive models for location shape and scale (GAMLSS) and are presented as percentiles, means, and standard deviations.RESULTS: Generalized additive models for location shape and scale fit the observed data well for each measure, leading to reliable estimates of normative values. Performance on all tasks decreased with age. Educational attainment was a strong determinant of performance on all cognitive tests. Tests of walking speed were dependent on height. Distribution of body mass index did not change with age, owing to simultaneous declines in weight and height.CONCLUSION: Normative values were found for tests of many aspects of cognitive and physical function based on a representative sample of the general older Irish population."

All participants accepted examination by the MoCA-CS, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and other related scales. A detailed neuropsychological battery was used for making a final cognitive diagnosis. SPSS 16.0 statistical software was used for reliability, validity examination, and optimal cutoff score detection.RESULTS: Cronbach's a of the MoCA-CS was 0.884, and test-retest and interrater reliability of the MoCA-CS were 0.966 and 0.926, respectively. MoCA-CS scores were highly correlated with MMSE scores (r = 0.867) and simplified intelligence quotients (r = 0.822). The results indicate that 1 point should be added for subjects with less than 6 years of education, and that the optimal cutoff score for detecting VCI-ND is 26/27 (sensitivity 96.1%, specificity 75.6%), whereas the optimal cutoff score for detecting VD is 16/17 (sensitivity 92.7%, specificity 96.3%).CONCLUSION: The MoCA-CS has good reliability and validity, and is a useful cognitive screening instrument for detecting VCI in the Chinese population."

But there was no statistical difference in MMSE or MOCA score after treatment between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05). The Chinese medicine dementia syndromes scales significantly decreased in the treatment group when compared with before treatment (P &lt; 0.01). But there was no statistical difference in Chinese medicine dementia syndromes scales in the control group between before and after treatment (P &gt; 0.05). There was statistical difference in Chinese medicine dementia syndromes scales after treatment between the two groups (P &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSION: MSP could effectively intervene the progress of VCIND."
"23596467","Effects of carotid artery stenting on cognitive function in patients with mild cognitive impairment and carotid stenosis.","Carotid stenosis is known to be an independent risk factor in the transformation process of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia and is treated by carotid artery stenting (CAS); however, the effects of CAS on cognitive function are unclear. In this study, 240 patients were prospectively assigned to a CAS or control group according to patient preference and underwent detailed neuropsychological examinations (NPEs) before and 6 months after treatment. Cerebral perfusion was assessed with computed tomography perfusion (CTP). Among the 240 patients included in the study, 208 patients completed NPEs at baseline and 6 months after therapy. The patients in the two groups did not differ with regard to baseline characteristics, educational level, vascular risk factors (VRFs) and NPEs prior to therapy. Significant improvements in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; before, 24.61.7 vs. after, 24.81.9; P=0.016), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA; before, 23.71.7 vs. after, 24.12.0; P=0.006), Fuld Object Memory Evaluation (FOME; before, 13.82.2 vs. after, 14.02.3; P=0.031) and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-digital span (WAIS-DS; before, 6.72.1 vs. after, 6.92.3; P=0.040) were observed in the CAS group; however, improvements were not observed in the control group. Of the 84 patients in the CAS group who received CTP follow-up, 72 (86%) presented improvements in ipsilateral brain perfusion 6 months after the procedure; however, no improvement was observed in the control group. Close correlations were identified between the change in perfusion and the change in MMSE (r=0.575) and MOCA (r=0.574). CAS improves global cognitive function in patients with carotid stenosis and MCI and the improvement of cognition is closely related to the improvement of cerebral perfusion."
"23584853","Premorbid IQ influence on screening tests' scores in healthy patients and patients with cognitive impairment.","Cognitive screening tests are well-established tools for detecting cognitive impairment, but concerns regarding the influence of premorbid intelligence on patient's performance and cognitive status classification remain. Risk of inaccurate assessment especially affects the elders with high or low premorbid intelligence (who are more likely to be misclassified). The present study examines the influence of premorbid intelligence assessed by the TeLPI (an irregular words reading test) on 2 cognitive screening tests, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), in healthy participants and patients with cognitive impairments (mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease). Results show that premorbid IQ influences the MMSE and the MoCA scores in both the groups, predicting variance from 8.4% to 33.2%, according to test and group analyzed. Hence, we propose that whenever the MMSE or the MoCA is used, premorbid IQ evaluation should also be considered to ensure correct interpretation and classification."
"23548916","The NeuroAiD II (MLC901) in vascular cognitive impairment study (NEURITES).","BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of patients after nondisabling stroke are cognitively impaired compared to age- and education-matched community-dwelling controls. Moreover, poststroke patients who have 'vascular cognitive impairment no dementia' (VCIND) of moderate severity have a high risk of incident dementia, dependency and death. Further studies are urgently needed to demonstrate effective cognition-enhancing therapies in VCIND given the scarcity of evidence-based treatment options. NeuroAiD is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been shown to induce neuroplasticity, promote cell proliferation and stimulate the development of dense axonal and dendritic networks in animal stroke models. NeuroAiD may improve cerebral blood flow and functional recovery after stroke in patients.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects and tolerability of NeuroAiD II in patients with VCIND.METHODS: The NeuroAiD II (MLC901) in Vascular Cognitive Impairment Study (NEURITES) is a 24-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase II study of NeuroAiD II in patients with VCIND. The primary outcome is executive function as measured by the Verbal Fluency test. Secondary outcomes include cognitive assessments such as the ADAS-Cog, MoCA, MMSE and Cognitive Battery: activities of daily living as measured by the Alzhei-mer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scale for mild cognitive impairment, behavior as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and depression as measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale and the Beck Depression Scale. In addition, there will be novel exploratory outcomes: (a) magnetic resonance imaging of lesion location (structural imaging), structural integrity of white matter pathways (diffusion tensor imaging), neuronal function (resting studies) and perfusion (arterial spin labeling and MR angiography), and (b) retinal and optic nerve imaging. Safety and tolerability will be assessed using adverse events, laboratory tests and vital signs.CONCLUSIONS: NEURITES has the potential to set new standards for the systematic evaluation of Asian traditional medicine for integration into standard medicine practice and establishing a novel therapeutic approach for improving cognition after stroke."
"23385364","Limitations for interpreting failure on individual subtests of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment.","BACKGROUND: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is sensitive to mild forms of cognitive impairment in geriatric populations and asks questions under the subheadings visuospatial/executive, naming, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall, and orientation. This study examined the extent to which these subsets of MoCA items evaluate their intended cognitive domains.METHODS: Clinical data from 185 geriatric memory clinic outpatients who underwent cognitive screening and subsequent neuropsychological assessment were analyzed. Factor analysis of their neuropsychological test scores identified 5 cognitive domains memory, language, visuospatial ability, attention/processing speed, and cognitive control. Scores on MoCA subtests were examined for their correlations with individual factor scores and for their sensitivity and specificity in predicting impairment within each domain.RESULTS: The MoCA subtest scores correlated significantly but modestly with neuropsychological test factor scores in their corresponding domains, for example, the correlation between 5-word recall and the memory factor was 0.46. However, subtest scores were poor predictors of impaired performance on the tests contributing to each cognitive domain. The best predictive accuracy was seen for the visuospatial/executive subtest that showed fair accuracy at predicting impairment on tests in the visuospatial domain. Other subtests showed unacceptably poor levels of accuracy when predicting impaired scores in their respective domains (60%-67%).CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of geriatric outpatients referred for cognitive assessment, performance on individual items and subtests of the MoCA yields insufficient information to draw conclusions about impairment in specific cognitive domains as determined by neuropsychological testing."
"23380993","The informant AD8 is superior to participant AD8 in detecting cognitive impairment in a memory clinic setting.","The informant AD8 has good discriminatory indices in detecting questionable dementia. However, studies on participant AD8 yielded inconsistent results. This study aims to investigate the discriminatory ability of the AD8 in detecting cognitive impairment at a memory clinic by comparing the informant AD8, participant AD8, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The AD8 was administered to 280 participant-informant dyads. The MoCA and MMSE were administered to all participants, who subsequently received a comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological assessment leading to a consensus diagnosis and a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to compare the discriminatory ability of AD8, MoCA, and MMSE. Participants were Chinese (83.6%) females (54.3%) with a mean age and education of 73.4  8.6 years and 6.2  5.6 years, respectively. The discriminant validity of the informant AD8 was significantly superior to the participant AD8 in detecting cognitive impairment (CDR = 0.5) {Area Under Curve (AUC) [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 0.96 (0.93-0.98) versus 0.66 (0.58-0.74), p &lt; 0.01}. Furthermore, the informant AD8 was equivalent to MoCA and MMSE in detecting cognitive impairment {AUC [95% CI]: MoCA [0.98 (0.96-0.99)]; MMSE [0.95 (0.93-0.98)]}. The informant AD8 (=2) had very good sensitivity and specificity, while the participant AD8 (=2) had suboptimal sensitivity and specificity in detecting cognitive impairment (sensitivity 0.93 versus 0.59; specificity 0.87 versus 0.65; 91.8% versus 60% correctly classified). The informant AD8 is superior to the participant AD8, and equivalent to the MMSE and MoCA in screening for cognitive impairment in memory clinic patients."

"23364388","Mild cognitive impairment in moderate to severe COPD: a preliminary study.","BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is a frequent feature of COPD. However, the proportion of patients with COPD with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is still unknown, and no screening test has been validated to date for detecting MCI in this population. The goal of this study was to determine the frequency and subtypes of MCI in patients with COPD and to assess the validity of two cognitive screening tests, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), in detecting MCI in patients with COPD.METHODS: Forty-five patients with moderate to severe COPD and 50 healthy control subjects underwent a comprehensive neuropsychologic assessment using standard MCI criteria. Receiver operating characteristic curves were obtained to assess the validity of the MMSE and the MoCA to detect MCI in patients with COPD.RESULTS: MCI was found in 36% of patients with COPD compared with 12% of healthy subjects. Patients with COPD with MCI had mainly the nonamnestic MCI single domain subtype with predominant attention and executive dysfunctions. The optimal MoCA screening cutoff was 26 (= 25 indicates impairment, with 81% sensitivity, 72% specificity, and 76% correctly diagnosed). No MMSE cutoff had acceptable validity.CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, a substantial proportion of patients with COPD were found to have MCI, a known risk factor for dementia. Longitudinal follow-up on these patients is needed to determine the risk of developing more severe cognitive and functional impairments. Moreover, the MoCA is superior to the MMSE in detecting MCI in patients with COPD."
"23359073","[Neurocognitive screening in substance addicts: the Montreal Cognitive Assessment].","INTRODUCTION: The detection of neurocognitive disorders in addicts would allow subjects with functional impairment to be assigned to cognitive rehabilitation programmes. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a screening test that can be a valuable aid with this kind of patient.AIMS: To use the MoCA with a sample of subjects with addictions who are receiving treatment and to compare the results with the criteria proposed for the general population, mild cognitive impairment and early dementias. It also intends to examine the concurrent validity with global execution tests and the relationship with socio-demographic variables and others related to addiction.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The MoCA and the Allen Cognitive Level Screen-5 (ACLS-5) test were administered to a sample of 79 patients with addiction who were beginning treatment in a specific centre.RESULTS: Only 29.1% of the participants presented normal performance in terms of the criteria proposed by the authors. The others achieved scores below the cut-off point, many of them displaying an alarmingly low score, even when compared with criteria for mild cognitive impairment and early dementias. The MoCA showed concurrent validity with the ACLS-5 and correlation with academic level, but not with variables related to addiction.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA is a test that is quick and simple to administer and correct. It allows the detection of subjects with extremely low cognitive performance that require neuropsychological and occupational interventions for cognitive rehabilitation, which increases treatment compliance and the benefits to be gained from other interventions with important cognitive demands, such as relapse prevention psychotherapy."
"23345074","The Alzheimer's disease-8 and Montreal Cognitive Assessment as screening tools for neurocognitive impairment in HIV-infected persons.","The diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated neurocognitive impairment is time-intensive and often omitted in busy outpatient settings. Brief screening tools are needed. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Alzheimer's disease (AD)-8 have been used in neurodegenerative disorders. We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of these brief screening tools in HIV-infected persons. The AD-8, MoCA, and formal neuropsychological testing were administered to 200 HIV-infected patients who were followed at a single institution. Normalized scores on formal neuropsychological testing were used to define neurocognitive impairment. The sensitivity and specificity of the MoCA and AD-8 were assessed to diagnose the impairment. Neurocognitive impairment was highly prevalent in this cohort: 127 persons (64 %) were diagnosed with neurocognitive impairment based on formal testing. Using the AD-8 and MoCA, 113 (57 %) and 101 (51 %) persons were identified with neurocognitive impairment, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of MoCA were 63 % and 71 %, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of AD-8 were 61 % and 51 %, respectively. Our findings highlight that brief screening tools correlate with formal neuropsychological testing. However, the sensitivities of these screening tools are lower than desired. Nevertheless, given their ease in administration, these tools could assist as a first line for identifying individuals who may subsequently require formal neuropsychological testing."
"23277783","Screening for very mild subcortical vascular dementia patients aged 75 and above using the montreal cognitive assessment and mini-mental state examination in a community: the kurihara project.","AIMS: To examine the effectiveness of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to screen people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), to associate the MoCA score with the presence of infarction, and to detect the characteristics of people with very mild subcortical vascular dementia (vmSVD).METHODS: 392 out of 886 community dwellers aged 75 years and above living in Kurihara, Northern Japan, agreed to participate in our study; 164 scored a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0 (healthy), 184 scored a CDR of 0.5 (MCI) and 44 scored a CDR of 1+ (dementia). The participants scoring a CDR of 0.5 were divided into 2 subtypes: 37 had vmSVD and 147 had other types of dementia. The objective variables were the total MoCA, the MoCA subscale and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).RESULTS: There was a difference in the MoCA and MMSE scores between the 3 CDR groups. The MoCA score overlapped in participants with CDR 0 and 0.5. There were significant CDR effects, while there were no significant infarction effects for the MoCA and MMSE. vmSVD participants had lower scores on the total MoCA, the MoCA attention subscale and MMSE than healthy elderly people and participants with other types of dementia.CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that MMSE performed rather well and that the MoCA is not superior to MMSE in MCI and vmSVD participants aged 75 and above in a community."

"25487428","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment: A Pilot Study of a Brief Screening Tool for Mild and Moderate Cognitive Impairment in HIV-Positive Veterans.","HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs) are common, often go undetected, and can impact treatment outcomes. There is limited evidence on how to perform routine cognitive screening in HIV clinical settings. To address this, 44 HIV-positive males were recruited from a Veteran Affairs Infectious Disease clinic and completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS), and Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21. In all, 50% scored below the MoCA cutoff and 36% scored below the IHDS cutoff. Current CD4 was the strongest predictor of an abnormal MoCA score (P = .007, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.987-0.998) and elevated depression was the second strongest predictor (P = .008, CI: 1.043-1.326). Combination antiviral therapy use and age were not significant predictors in this model. The MoCA appeared to be a reasonable screening tool to detect cognitive impairment in HIV-positive patients, and although it is not sufficient to diagnose HAND, it has the potential to provide meaningful clinical data.

"25481217","A mobile application for cognitive screening of dementia.","Neuropsychological assessment tests have an important role in early detection of dementia. Therefore, we designed and implemented a test battery for mobile devices that can be used for mobile cognitive screening (MCS). This battery consists of 33 questions from 14 type of tests for the assessment of 8 different cognitive functions: Arithmetic, orientation, abstraction, attention, memory, language, visual, and executive functions. This test battery is implemented as an application for mobile devices that operates on Android OS. In order to validate the effectiveness of the neuropsychological test battery, it was applied on a group of 23 elderly persons. Within this group, 9 (of age 81.784.77) were healthy and 14 (of age 72.559.95) were already diagnosed with dementia. The education level of the control group (healthy) and dementia group were comparable as they spent 13.665.07 and 13.714.14 years at school respectively. For comparison, a validated paper-and-pencil test (Montreal Cognitive Test - MoCA) was applied along with the proposed MCS battery. The proposed test was able to differentiate the individuals in the control and dementia groups for executive, visual, memory, attention, orientation functions with statistical significance (p&lt;0.05). Results of the remaining functions; language, abstraction, and arithmetic were statistically insignificant (p&gt;0.05). The results of MCS and MoCA were compared, and the scores of individuals from these tests were correlated (r(2)=0.57). "
"25433800","Effects of differences in serum total homocysteine, folate, and vitamin B12 on cognitive impairment in stroke patients.","BACKGROUND: Vascular cognitive impairment-no dementia (VCIND) refers to the early or mild cognitive impairment induced by cerebral vascular injury. Research shows that serum total homocysteine (tHcy) level is an independent risk factor for cerebral vascular disease and may be closely related to cognitive function.Current studies on the tHcy level in VCIND patients are limited, and the relationship of tHcy with cognitive function remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the tHcy levels in patients with VCIND and to determine their correlation with cognitive function, as well as to provide useful clues for preventing and treating VCIND.METHODS: The tHcy, folate, and vitamin B12 levels in 82 patients with VCIND were reviewed retrospectively and compared with those of 80 stroke patients without cognitive impairment and 69 healthy controls by using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale and the event-related potential P300 to evaluate cognitive function.RESULTS: The tHcy levels in the VCIND group were higher than those in the other two groups, whereas the folate and Vitamin B12 levels in the VCIND group were lower than those of the other two groups. The tHcy levels in the stroke group were higher than those in the control group, and the folate and vitamin B12 levels in the stroke group were lower than those in the control group. The patients in the VCIND group with high tHcy exhibited lower MoCA scores and prolonged P300 latency than those in with normal tHcy. Correlation analysis showed that tHcy level is positively correlated with P300 latency period and negatively correlated with MoCA score.CONCLUSION: The tHcy levels were significantly higher and the vitamin B12 and folate levels were significantly lower in the patients with VCIND than those in the other groups. The high tHcy levels in the VCIND patients may be correlated with impaired cognitive function."

From the viewpoint of long-term continuity of activity, it is necessary to develop various cognitive stimulating programs. The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a cognitive intervention through a training program for picture book reading for community-dwelling older adults.METHODS: Fifty-eight Japanese older participants were divided into the intervention and control groups using simple randomization (n =29 vs 29). In the intervention group, participants took part in a program aimed at learning and mastering methods of picture book reading as a form of cognitive training intervention. The control group listened to lectures about elderly health maintenance. Cognitive tests were conducted individually before and after the programs.RESULTS: The rate of memory retention, computed by dividing Logical Memory delayed recall by immediate recall, showed a significant interaction (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.05) in analysis of covariance. Simple main effects showed that the rate of memory retention of the intervention group improved after the program completion (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.05). In the participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) examined by Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J) (n =14 vs 15), significant interactions were seen in Trail Making Test-A (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.01), Trail Making Test-B (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.05), Kana pick-out test (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.05) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.05).CONCLUSIONS: The intervention effect was found in delayed verbal memory. This program is also effective for improving attention and executive function in those with MCI. The short-term interventional findings suggest that this program might contribute to preventing a decline in memory and executive function.CTR: UMIN000014712 (Date of ICMJE and WHO compliant trial information disclosure: 30 July 2014)."
"25381961","Conversion between mini-mental state examination, montreal cognitive assessment, and dementia rating scale-2 scores in Parkinson's disease.","Cognitive impairment is one of the earliest, most common, and most disabling non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Thus, routine screening of global cognitive abilities is important for the optimal management of PD patients. Few global cognitive screening instruments have been developed for or validated in PD patients. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Dementia Rating Scale-2 (DRS-2) have been used extensively for cognitive screening in both clinical and research settings. Determining how to convert the scores between instruments would facilitate the longitudinal assessment of cognition in clinical settings and the comparison and synthesis of cognitive data in multicenter and longitudinal cohort studies. The primary aim of this study was to apply a simple and reliable algorithm for the conversion of MoCA to MMSE scores in PD patients. A secondary aim was to apply this algorithm for the conversion of DRS-2 to both MMSE and MoCA scores. The cognitive performance of a convenience sample of 360 patients with idiopathic PD was assessed by at least two of these cognitive screening instruments. We then developed conversion scores between the MMSE, MoCA, and DRS-2 using equipercentile equating and log-linear smoothing. The conversion score tables reported here enable direct and easy comparison of three routinely used cognitive screening assessments in PD patients."
"25380622","Normative data for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in an Italian population sample.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a rapid screening battery, also including subtests to assess frontal functions such as set-shifting, abstraction and cognitive flexibility. MoCA seems to be useful to identify non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and subcortical dementia; it has high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing MCI from mild Alzheimer's Disease. Previous studies revealed that certain items of MoCA may be culturally biased and highlighted the need for population-based norms for the MoCA. The aim of present study was to collect normative values in a sample of Italian healthy subjects. Four hundred and fifteen Italian healthy subjects (252 women and 163 men) of different ages (age range 21-95 years) and educational level (from primary to university) underwent MoCA and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that age and education significantly influenced performance on MoCA. No significant effect of gender was found. From the derived linear equation, a correction grid for MoCA raw scores was built. Inferential cut-off score, estimated using a non-parametric technique, is 15.5 and equivalent scores were computed. Correlation analysis showed a significant but weak correlation between MoCA adjusted scores with MMSE adjusted scores (r = 0.43, p &lt; 0.001). The present study provided normative data for the MoCA in an Italian population useful for both clinical and research purposes."

We evaluated the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) for suitability in assessing cognitive performance in HD patients in comparison to the commonly used Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and a detailed neuropsychological test battery, used as gold standard.METHODS: 43 HD patients and 42 healthy controls with an average age of 58 years, were assessed with the MoCA, the MMSE and a detailed neuropsychological test battery, covering the domains of memory, attention, language, visuospatial and executive functions. Composite scores were created for comparison of cognitive domains and test results were analyzed using Spearman's correlation and linear regression. Cognitive dysfunction was defined using z-score values and predictive values were calculated. Sensitivity and specificity of the MoCA were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.RESULTS: HD patients performed worse in all cognitive domains, especially in memory recall and executive functions. The MoCA correlated well with the detailed test battery and identified patients with cognitive impairment with a sensitivity of 76.7% and specificity of 78.6% for a cut-off value of =24 out of 30 points. In the detailed assessment executive functions accounted significantly for performance in the MoCA. The MMSE only discriminated weakly between groups.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA represents a suitable cognitive screening tool for hemodialysis patients, demonstrating good sensitivity and specificity levels, and covering executive functions, which appear to play an important role in cognitive performance of HD patients."

This study is the first validation in Latin America of the MoCA in Spanish (MoCA-S), which was developed in Colombia (South America).METHODS: Aiming to perform the first validation of the MoCA-S, we developed a study of concordance by conformity to assess the MoCA-S compared with diagnostic consensus by interdisciplinary assessment in the Memory Clinic (the best diagnostic method available) and to evaluate the psychometric properties of the MoCA-S. A total of 193 subjects were evaluated, 109 of whom were patients, including 26 who met the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) clinical criteria, based on neuropsychological testing, and 83 who had mild dementia (MD). The remaining 84 participants were healthy subjects from the community.RESULTS: The psychometric evaluation of the MoCA-S was appropriate. Using a cutoff score of = 23, the MoCA had sensitivities of 76.0% to detect MCI and 92.7% to detect MD and a specificity of 79.8%. The percentage of patients clearly labeled by the MoCA-S was 85%.CONCLUSION: The MoCA-S is a valid screening tool and is useful for identifying MCI and MD in Colombia. The MoCA-S is valid and adequate for application in Colombia with good internal consistency, inter-observer reliability, and content validity. However, the average educational level was high in this study; thus, caution should be exercised when extrapolating these results to individuals with lower educational levels."
"25282632","Diagnostic utility of Montreal Cognitive Assessment in the Fifth Edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: major and mild neurocognitive disorders.","OBJECTIVES: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) is a screening tool for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. The new criteria for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition (DSM-5) mild neurocognitive disorder (NCD) define participants with cognitive decline but no dementia, and major NCD (dementia). We explored the usefulness of MOCA to detect major and mild NCD.DESIGN: Cross-sectional test research.SETTING: Tertiary hospital memory clinic and community-based Singapore Longitudinal Aging Study (SLAS).PARTICIPANTS: Participants with questionable dementia (clinical dementia rating, CDR = 0.5) and early dementia (CDR =1) over a period of 1 year were identified from the memory clinic registry. The patient records were reviewed and the diagnostic labels of major and mild NCD were applied accordingly. Healthy controls (HC) (CDR = 0, Mini-Mental State Examination &gt;26) were recruited from the on-going SLAS.MEASUREMENTS: Major and mild NCD were diagnosed based on medical history, clinical examination, basic and instrumental activities of daily living, locally validated bedside cognitive tests (Mini-Mental State Examination, Frontal Assessment Battery, and Clock Drawing Test), relevant laboratory investigations and standardized neuropsychological assessment.RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-one participants were included (41 mild NCD, 64 major NCD, 146 HC). On receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the diagnostic performance by area under the curve (AUC) for MOCA was 0.99 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98-1.0] for major NCD and 0.77 (95% CI 0.67-0.86) for mild NCD. For diagnosis of mild NCD, MOCA performed better in those with lower education (primary and below) (AUC 0.90) compared with those with secondary education and beyond (AUC 0.66).CONCLUSION: MOCA has high diagnostic utility for major NCD but its usefulness in detecting mild NCD is more modest. Possible reasons include greater heterogeneity in participants with mild NCD and how &quot;quantified clinical assessment&quot; in the DSM-5 mild NCD criteria is interpreted and operationalized."

A representative sample of 30 patients with KS and 30 age-, education-, gender- and premorbid-IQ-matched controls was administered the MoCA and MMSE. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated in addition to the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for various cut-off points on the MoCA and MMSE. Compared with the MMSE, the MoCA demonstrated consistently superior psychometric properties and discriminant validity--AUC: MoCA (1.00 SE .003) and MMSE (0.92 SE .033). When applying a cut-off value as suggested in the manuals of both instruments, the MMSE (&lt; 24) misdiagnosed 46.7% of the patients, while the MoCA (&lt; 26) diagnosed all patients correctly. As a screening instrument with the most optimal cut-offs, the MoCA (optimal cutoff point 22/23, 98.3% correctly diagnosed) was superior to the MMSE (optimal cutoff point 26/27, 83.3% correctly diagnosed). We conclude that both tests have adequate psychometric properties as a screening instrument for the detection of KS, but the MoCA is superior to the MMSE for this specific patient population."
"25190446","Test accuracy of cognitive screening tests for diagnosis of dementia and multidomain cognitive impairment in stroke.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Guidelines recommend screening stroke-survivors for cognitive impairments. We sought to collate published data on test accuracy of cognitive screening tools.METHODS: Index test was any direct, cognitive screening assessment compared against reference standard diagnosis of (undifferentiated) multidomain cognitive impairment/dementia. We used a sensitive search statement to search multiple, cross-disciplinary databases from inception to January 2014. Titles, abstracts, and articles were screened by independent researchers. We described risk of bias using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool and reporting quality using Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy guidance. Where data allowed, we pooled test accuracy using bivariate methods.RESULTS: From 19 182 titles, we reviewed 241 articles, 35 suitable for inclusion. There was substantial heterogeneity: 25 differing screening tests; differing stroke settings (acute stroke, n=11 articles), and reference standards used (neuropsychological battery, n=21 articles). One article was graded low risk of bias; common issues were case-control methodology (n=7 articles) and missing data (n=22). We pooled data for 4 tests at various screen positive thresholds: Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (&lt;88/100): sensitivity 0.96, specificity 0.70 (2 studies); Mini Mental State Examination (&lt;27/30): sensitivity 0.71, specificity 0.85 (12 studies); Montreal Cognitive Assessment (&lt;26/30): sensitivity 0.95, specificity 0.45 (4 studies); MoCA (&lt;22/30): sensitivity 0.84, specificity 0.78 (6 studies); Rotterdam-CAMCOG (&lt;33/49): sensitivity 0.57, specificity 0.92 (2 studies).CONCLUSIONS: Commonly used cognitive screening tools have similar accuracy for detection of dementia/multidomain impairment with no clearly superior test and no evidence that screening tools with longer administration times perform better. MoCA at usual threshold offers short assessment time with high sensitivity but at cost of specificity; adapted cutoffs have improved specificity without sacrificing sensitivity. Our results must be interpreted in the context of modest study numbers: heterogeneity and potential bias."
"25187003","Cognitive stimulation in cognitively impaired individuals and cognitively healthy individuals with a family history of dementia: short-term results from the &quot;Allena-Mente&quot; randomized controlled trial.","OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the short-term efficacy of a protocol of cognitive stimulation (CS), compared with a sham intervention, on cognitive performance in cognitively healthy individuals with a family history of dementia (NDFAM) and in non-demented individuals with cognitive impairment (CI).METHODS: We performed a randomized controlled trial of CS in NDFAM and CI. CS consisted in 10 twice weekly meetings of CS focused on a specific cognitive area. CS was compared with a sham intervention (CT) using Mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Corsi test. All study participants were typed for the presence of apolipoprotein E (APOE)-<U+0190>4.RESULTS: Cognitively healthy NDFAM showed a higher net cognitive gain after CS, as reflected in their MoCA score, and a borderline significant net increase in visuospatial memory (Corsi test) compared with those receiving the CT. APOE-<U+0190>4 carriers showed a less significant improvement on the Corsi test with respect to APOE-<U+0190>4 non-carriers. In the CI sample, the MoCA and Corsi test results did not differ between the cognitively stimulated subjects and the controls. No changes in MMSE scores were found in either sample of subjects.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that CS as structured in this study is an effective treatment in cognitively healthy individuals, whereas it is less effective in individuals with CI. Moreover, evaluation of APOE-<U+0190>4 status provided evidence of a substantial genetic contribution to the efficacy of CS on visuospatial memory as measured using the Corsi test."
"25177332","Effect Size (Cohen's d) of Cognitive Screening Instruments Examined in Pragmatic Diagnostic Accuracy Studies.","AIMS: Many cognitive screening instruments (CSI) are available to clinicians to assess cognitive function. The optimal method comparing the diagnostic utility of such tests is uncertain. The effect size (Cohen's d), calculated as the difference of the means of two groups divided by the weighted pooled standard deviations of these groups, may permit such comparisons.METHODS: Datasets from five pragmatic diagnostic accuracy studies, which examined the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Mini-Mental Parkinson (MMP), the Six-Item Cognitive Impairment Test (6CIT), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Test Your Memory test (TYM), and the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R), were analysed to calculate the effect size (Cohen's d) for the diagnosis of dementia versus no dementia and for the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment versus no dementia (subjective memory impairment).RESULTS: The effect sizes for dementia versus no dementia diagnosis were large for all six CSI examined (range 1.59-1.87). For the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment versus no dementia, the effect sizes ranged from medium to large (range 0.48-1.45), with MoCA having the largest effect size.CONCLUSION: The calculation of the effect size (Cohen's d) in diagnostic accuracy studies is straightforward. The routine incorporation of effect size calculations into diagnostic accuracy studies merits consideration in order to facilitate the comparison of the relative value of CSI."
"25176439","Montreal Cognitive Assessment for the screening and prediction of cognitive decline in early Parkinson's disease.","BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of cognitive impairment in PD would allow appropriate monitoring and timely intervention to reduce the progression to dementia (PDD).OBJECTIVE: To study the usefulness of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in the screening for mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and its predictive utility in determining longitudinal cognitive decline in PD.METHODS: Prospective longitudinal study of patients with mild PD. PD-MCI and PDD was diagnosed based on the Movement Disorder taskforce (MDS) criteria. Receiver Operating Characteristic analyses and Cox regression analyses were performed.RESULTS: 95 patients; mean age 66.37 (SD 7.86); mean H&amp;Y score of 1.99 (SD 0.45) were studied. At baseline, 34 patients fulfilled the MDS criteria for PD-MCI. MoCA, compared to the MMSE had a high discriminatory power in detecting PD-MCI [Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.912, p&lt;0.001]. A MoCA score of =26 provided a sensitivity of 93.1% for the diagnosis of PD-MCI. In the longitudinal cohort over 2 years, baseline MOCA was useful in predicting cognitive decline (AUC of 0.707, p=0.05). With Cox regression analyses, a 1-point lower score on baseline MoCA was associated with a 34% increased risk of cognitive decline [Hazard ratio (HR) 1.34; 95% CI: 1.03-1.74: p=0.029]. A baseline MoCA =26 was highly predictive of progressive cognitive decline (HR 3.47, 95% CI: 2.38-5.07; p&lt;0.01).CONCLUSIONS: MoCA is a reliable tool in predicting cognitive decline in early PD. A MoCA score of =26 significantly increases the risk for progressive cognitive decline."
"25159539","Glucose metabolism measured by positron emission tomography is reduced in patients with white matter presumably ischemic lesions.","BACKGROUND: The severity and progression of white matter ischemic lesion (WMIL) are closely linked to vascular dementia. The function of neural tissue is closely linked to glucose consumption as the most important energy-supplying metabolic process. At present, [18]fluorine-fluorodeoxy glucose ([18]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) can provide regional and 3-dimensional quantification of glucose metabolism in the human brain. Although MMSE and MoCA are commonly used screens in cognitive impairment, no research team has yet validated their performance in WMIL. The purpose of our study was to compare MMSE and MoCA in screening for cognitive impairment and to explore the correlations between CMRglu values and executive function.MATERIAL AND METHODS: All the participants underwent comprehensive clinical, MoCA, MMSE, MRI, and PET examinations. Patients in the WMIL group were subdivided into 3 severity subgroups according to the Fazekas scale.RESULTS: The MoCA scores were lower in the WMIL group. Our research indicates that MoCA is a more sensitive screening tool than the commonly used MMSE in detecting cognitive impairment in patients with WMIL. CMRglu values of gray matter were decreased in the WMIL group. Reductions of CMRglu in parietal lobe, frontal lobe, and white matter centrum semiovale were observed to different degrees in the WMIL groups according to the modified Fazekas scale. A significant negative correlation was found between executive function and CMRglu in the frontal lobe.CONCLUSIONS: MoCA appears to be a more sensitive screening tool than the commonly used MMSE in detecting cognitive impairment in patients with WMIL. CMRglu can potentially be used as a biomarker for predicting the severity of WMIL."
"25147113","Optimal cutoff scores for dementia and mild cognitive impairment of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment among elderly and oldest-old Chinese population.","BACKGROUND: All versions of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) lack population-based data of 80-plus individuals. The norms and cut-off scores for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia of the MoCA are different among five Chinese versions.OBJECTIVE: To provide the cut-off scores in detecting MCI and dementia of the Peking Medical Union College Hospital version of the MoCA (MoCA-P).METHODS: In a cross-sectional survey, Chinese veterans aged =60 years completed the MoCA-P and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).RESULTS: Among 7,445 elderly veterans, 5,085 (68.30%) were aged =80 years old, 2,621 (35.20%) had 6 years of education or less, 6,847 (91.97%) were male, and 2,311 (31.04%) and 984 (13.22%) veterans were diagnosed as having MCI and dementia, respectively. Adding two points and one point to the MoCA scores for the primary and middle school groups, respectively, can fully adjust for the notable impact of education but cannot compensate for the effect of age. In the three age groups (60-79, 80-89, and =90 years old), the optimal MoCA-P cut-off scores for detecting MCI were =25, =24, and =23, respectively, and for detecting dementia were =24, =21, and =19, respectively, which demonstrated relatively high sensitivities and specificities. The areas under the curves for the MoCA-P for detecting MCI and dementia (0.937 and 0.908, respectively) were greater than those for the MMSE (0.848 and 0.892, respectively).CONCLUSION: Compared with the MMSE, the MoCA-P is significantly better for detecting MCI in the elderly, particularly in the oldest old population, and it also displays more effectiveness in detecting dementia."
"25139107","Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)-Italian version: regression based norms and equivalent scores.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a brief cognitive screening instrument developed by Nasreddine et al. to detect mild cognitive impairment, a high-risk condition for Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. In this study we report normative data on the MoCA-Italian version, collected on a sample of 225 Italian healthy subjects ranged in age between 60 and 80 years, and in formal education from 5 to 23 years. The global normal cognition was established in accordance with the Mini-Mental State Examination score and with the Prose Memory Test score (Spinnler and Tognoni, Ital J Neurol Sci 6:25-27, 1987). None of the participants had a history of psychiatric, neurological, cerebrovascular disorders or brain injury or took drugs affecting cognition. Linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the potential effect of age, education and sex on the MoCA total performance score. We provide correction grids to adjust raw scores and equivalent scores with cut-off value to allow comparison between MoCA performance and others neuropsychological test scores that can be administered on the same subject."
"25128866","The prevalence of cognitive impairment in emergency general surgery.","OBJECTIVES: Rates of all surgical procedures are increasing at a faster rate than the population is ageing. However, this encouraging statistic, necessitates a robust evidence base. The epidemiological evidence base in acute general surgery in the older person is sparse. This is the first assessment of the prevalence of cognitive impairment measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment tool (MoCA) in acute general surgery.METHODS: In three sites in Wales, England and Scotland comprising rural and urban populations, we studied consecutive patients aged over 65 years. We considered any older person admitted to the acute general surgical unit. We assessed them for baseline demographic data. They each underwent a MoCA assessment.RESULTS: We collected data on 245 people, mean age 76.9 years (8.1, standard deviation), 136 (55.5%) were women. Of these 201 completed the MoCA test, mean score of 18.9 and median score 20 (range 0-30). There were 37 (15.1%) MoCA scores in the normal range (=26) and 44 (18%) people were unable to attempt (or complete) the MoCA. Increasing age (p&lt;0.01) but not sex (p=0.14) predicted an abnormal MoCA. Considering only the 44 people who were unable to attempt the MoCA assessment, 11 (25%) were known to have a diagnosis of dementia, 9 (20.5%) were too unwell and the remainder unable to complete the assessment to due pre-existing disability.CONCLUSIONS: In a representative UK wide population, a high proportion of older people admitted with an acute general surgical problem had cognitive impairment when assessed using the MoCA."
"25125421","A validation study of the Hong Kong version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (HK-MoCA) in Chinese older adults in Hong Kong.","OBJECTIVE: To validate the Hong Kong version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (HK-MoCA) in identification of mild cognitive impairment and dementia in Chinese older adults.DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.SETTING: Cognition clinic and memory clinic of a public hospital in Hong Kong.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 272 participants (dementia, n=130; mild cognitive impairment, n=93; normal controls, n=49) aged 60 years or above were assessed using HK-MoCA. The HK-MoCA scores were validated against expert diagnosis according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed) criteria for dementia and Petersen's criteria for mild cognitive impairment. Statistical analysis was performed using receiver operating characteristic curve and regression analyses. Additionally, comparison was made with the Cantonese version of Mini-Mental State Examination and Global Deterioration Scale.RESULTS: The optimal cutoff score for the HK-MoCA to differentiate cognitive impaired persons (mild cognitive impairment and dementia) from normal controls was 21/22 after adjustment of education level, giving a sensitivity of 0.928, specificity of 0.735, and area under the curve of 0.920. Moreover, the cutoff to detect mild cognitive impairment was 21/22 with a sensitivity of 0.828, specificity of 0.735, and area under the curve of 0.847. Score of the Cantonese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination to detect mild cognitive impairment was 26/27 with a sensitivity of 0.785, specificity of 0.816, and area under the curve of 0.857. At the optimal cutoff of 18/19, HK-MoCA identified dementia from controls with a sensitivity of 0.923, specificity of 0.918, and area under the curve of 0.971.CONCLUSION: The HK-MoCA is a useful cognitive screening instrument for use in Chinese older adults in Hong Kong. A score of less than 22 should prompt further diagnostic assessment. It has comparable sensitivity with the Cantonese version of Mini-Mental State Examination for detection of mild cognitive impairment. It is brief and feasible to conduct in the clinical setting, and can be completed in less than 15 minutes. Thus, HK-MoCA provides an attractive alternative screening instrument to Mini-Mental State Examination which has ceiling effect (ie may fail to detect mild/moderate cognitive impairment in people with high education level or premorbid intelligence) and needs to be purchased due to copyright issues."
"25114516","Relationship between cognitive impairment and apparent diffusion coefficient values from magnetic resonance-diffusion weighted imaging in elderly hypertensive patients.","BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine a new method for the early diagnosis and assessment of mild cognitive impairment in elderly individuals with hypertension. Elderly hypertensive patients with cognitive impairment were assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Clinical Dementia Rating Assessment (CDR). Cognitive results were compared to apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values from magnetic resonance-diffusion weighted imaging.METHODS: A total of 191 patients were categorized into four groups: a control group (normal cognition and no hypertension; n=20); a normal group (hypertension and normal cognition; n=33); an mild cognitive impairment group (n=80); and a vascular dementia group (n=58). The MoCA and CDR tests were used to determine cognition. ADC values in eight brain regions were calculated with magnetic resonance-diffusion weighted imaging. Other characteristics were evaluated, eg, blood pressure, MoCA, and CDR scores, and the comparisons of the four groups were made.RESULTS: The MoCA and CDR scores differed among the four groups (P&lt;0.001). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure values increased as cognitive function declined (P&lt;0.001). Cognitive function declined as ADC values increased, and they differed between elderly people with and without hypertension (P&lt;0.001). Among elderly hypertensive participants, ADC values were significantly increased in the cortex and hippocampus.CONCLUSION: The MoCA and CDR tests were sufficiently sensitive to evaluate cognition. Blood pressure was closely related to cognition, as well as to functional and structural changes in the brain. These alterations were evidenced through changes in the ADC values and were most obvious in the cortex and hippocampus. Greater cognitive decline was observed in elderly participants with hypertension compared to those without. As hypertensive stage increased, greater ADC values were observed."
"25085750","Abnormal MoCA and normal range MMSE scores in Parkinson disease without dementia: cognitive and neurochemical correlates.","BACKGROUND: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is increasingly being used as a cognitive screening test in Parkinson disease (PD). The MoCA's popularity likely reflects its ability to detect executive dysfunction, a relative deficiency of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).OBJECTIVE: To compare neurochemical and neuropsychological functions in non-demented PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and without, as defined by MoCA (PD-MCI = MoCA&lt;26).METHODS: Non-demented PD subjects underwent combined MoCA and MMSE, detailed cognitive testing and [C]methyl-4-piperidinyl propionate acetylcholinesterase and [C]dihydrotetrabenazine monoaminergic PET imaging.RESULTS: Eighteen subjects met MoCA PD-MCI criteria but had MMSE scores in the normal range, compared to 29 subjects with normal MoCA and MMSE scores. The MoCA-defined PD-MCI group had reduced performance in global cognition (t = 2.91, P = 0.0056), most significantly in executive function (t = 3.18, P = 0.002), as well as significant reduction in dorsal caudate nucleus dopaminergic innervation (t = 2.72, P = 0.009) compared to the PD without MCI group. Both MoCA and MMSE had poor diagnostic accuracy for PD-MCI (65.3%) when using the Level 2 Movement Disorder Society Task Force definition.CONCLUSION: PD subjects with normal range MMSE but abnormal MoCA scores had evidence of caudate nucleus dopaminergic denervation and mild cognitive changes, predominantly in executive function. The MoCA may be able to preferentially detect executive dysfunction compared to the MMSE, but the MoCA has limited diagnostic accuracy for PD-MCI, and should not be used alone to make this diagnosis."
"25066497","A comparison of neuropsychological performance between US and Russia: preparing for a global clinical trial.","BACKGROUND: Understanding regional differences in cognitive performance is important for interpretation of data from large multinational clinical trials.METHODS: Data from Durham and Cabarrus Counties in North Carolina, USA and Tomsk, Russia (n=2972) were evaluated. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Trail Making Test Part B (Trails B), Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Word List Memory Test (WLM) delayed recall, and self-report Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Studies Mail-In Cognitive Function Screening Instrument (MCFSI) were administered at each site. Multilevel modeling measured the variance explained by site and predictors of cognitive performance.RESULTS: Site differences accounted for 11% of the variation in the MoCA, 1.6% in Trails B, 1.7% in WLM, and 0.8% in MCFSI scores. Prior memory testing was significantly associated with WLM. Diabetes and stroke were significantly associated with Trails B and MCFSI.CONCLUSIONS: Sources of variation include cultural differences, health conditions, and exposure to test stimuli. Findings highlight the importance of local norms to interpret test performance."
"25063270","Role of cognitive enhancer therapy in Alzheimer's disease with concomitant cerebral white matter disease: findings from a long-term naturalistic study.","BACKGROUND: Evidence is lacking for cognitive enhancer therapy in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and concomitant cerebrovascular disease (mixed AD) as such patients would have been excluded from clinical trials. Earlier studies of mixed AD have focused on large vessel cerebrovascular disease. The influence of small vessel cerebrovascular disease (svCVD) in the form of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) on treatment outcomes in mixed AD has not been addressed.OBJECTIVE: In this long-term naturalistic study, we evaluated the effectiveness of cognitive enhancers in patients with mixed AD with svCVD.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospective clinical database from a memory clinic of a tertiary hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging WMH was used as a marker of svCVD. Demographic, cognitive, and treatment data were analysed. Linear mixed models with patient-specific random effects were used to evaluate cognitive outcomes over time while adjusting for confounders.RESULTS: Patients with mixed AD (n = 137) or AD without svCVD (pure AD) (n = 28) were studied over a median duration of 28.7 months. Patients with mixed AD had a higher prevalence of hypertension (62.8 vs. 35.7 %, p = 0.011). The majority (75.2 %) of the study sample were managed with monotherapy. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores decreased over time (-0.04, p = 0.007), and the decrease was similar for both diagnosis groups (-0.03, p = 0.246). Annual estimated mean MMSE decline was 0.84 for pure AD and 0.48 for mixed AD. Similar trends were observed with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores, with annual estimated mean reduction of 0.72 and 0.48 for pure AD and mixed AD, respectively.CONCLUSION: Cognitive enhancers are effective in slowing the rate of cognitive decline in patients with AD with svCVD. These findings would need to be confirmed in randomized clinical trials."
"25046191","Preoperative cognitive impairment and psychological distress in hospitalized elderly hip fracture patients.","We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the prevalence of cognitive impairment (CI) in elderly inpatients awaiting surgery for hip fracture, and to compare CI and normal cognition (NC) patients with respect to preoperative pain, fear, and anxiety. The study included patients who were older than 65 years when admitted to a hospital after acute hip fracture. Preoperative assessment involved use of Confusion Assessment Method-Short Form, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), visual analog scales for anxiety and fear, and Wong-Baker Faces Pain Scale. Patients with delirium were excluded from the study. Patients with CI and NC, as determined by MoCA score, were compared for each assessment. Of the 65 hip fracture patients enrolled, 62 had evaluable cognitive data. Of these 62 patients, 23 (37.1%) had NC (MoCA score, = 23) and 39 (62.9%) had CI (MoCA score, &lt; 23). Only 5 (7.7%) of the 65 patients had a documented diagnosis of CI or dementia at time of hospitalization. Mean preoperative pain scores were significantly (P &lt; .001) higher for CI patients (5.3) than for NC patients (2.8). Our study results showed that many elderly hip fracture patients had unrecognized CI before surgery, and CI patients had significantly more pain than NC patients did. Appropriate identification of preoperative CI and treatment of pain are crucial in optimizing patient outcomes. "
"25040401","Amyloid-a Peptide in olfactory mucosa and mesenchymal stromal cells of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease patients.","Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) might develop olfactory dysfunction that correlates with progression of disease. Alteration of olfactory neuroepithelium associated with MCI may be useful as predictor of cognitive decline. Biomarkers with higher sensitivity and specificity would allow to understand the biological progression of the pathology in association with the clinical course of the disease. In this study, magnetic resonance images, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) load, Olfactory Connecticut test and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) indices were obtained from noncognitive impaired (NCI), MCI and AD patients. We established a culture of patient-derived olfactory stromal cells from biopsies of olfactory mucosa (OM) to test whether biological properties of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are concurrent with MCI and AD psychophysical pathology. We determined the expression of amyloid A peptides in the neuroepithelium of tissue sections from MCI and AD, as well as in cultured cells of OM. Reduced migration and proliferation of stromal (CD90(+) ) cells in MCI and AD with respect to NCI patients was determined. A higher proportion of anosmic MCI and AD cases were concurrent with the ApoE e4 allele. In summary, dysmetabolism of amyloid was concurrent with migration and proliferation impairment of patient-derived stem cells. "
"25040216","Feasibility of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in acute stroke patients.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cognitive deficits are common following stroke. Cognitive function in the acute stroke setting is a predictive factor for mid-term outcome. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a screening tool for cognitive impairment. The feasibility of MoCA in the acute phase of stroke was evaluated and factors predictive of cognitive impairment were determined.METHODS: In this prospective, single-centre, explorative and observational study consecutive patients with ischaemic (IS) or haemorrhagic (ICH) stroke were enrolled between March 2011 and September 2012. The routine work-up for each patient encompassed assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the pre-morbid modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Cognitive performance was measured using the German version of the MoCA within the first days of admission. A MoCA score of &lt;26 was considered to indicate cognitive impairment.RESULTS: Between March 2011 and September 2012 a total of 842 patients with IS (89.0%) and ICH (11.0%) were enrolled in our study. MoCA was feasible in 678/842 patients (80.5%). Factors independently associated with non-feasibility were stroke severity (NIHSS), pre-morbid functional status (mRS), age and lower educational level. Mean MoCA was 21.4 (SD 5.7). A total of 498/678 (73.5%) patients appeared cognitively impaired (&lt;26/30). Independent predictive factors for a lower MoCA score were age, educational level, stroke severity (NIHSS) and pre-morbid functional status (mRS).CONCLUSIONS: In the acute phase of stroke, MoCA is feasible in about 80% of eligible patients. At this stage, MoCA identifies a cognitive impairment in 75% of patients."
"25023857","Cognitive screening for dementia in primary care: a systematic review.","BACKGROUND: Identifying dementia in primary care could minimize the impact of a late intervention; however, it shows high rates of misdiagnosis. One of the reasons seems to be the lack of knowledge of adequate cognitive screening instruments. This is a systematic review of the available instruments for the primary care context.METHOD: For this systematic review, articles were collected according to the following combined key terms: &quot;cognitive screening&quot; and &quot;dementia&quot; and &quot;primary care&quot; and &quot;review&quot;. Studies should be reviews focusing on cognitive screening instruments best used in primary care setting.RESULTS: Thirteen reviews were selected. In total, it was considered 34 cognitive screening instruments. Half of the instruments can be applied in an adequate time-limit for primary care context. Memory is the most commonly assessed cognitive function (91%). Almost half of the tests are mentioned to have influence of education or cultural factors (44%).CONCLUSION: Tests such as 6CIT, AMT, GPCOG, Mini-Cog, MIS, MoCA, and STMS seem to be good alternatives to the use of the Mini-Mental State Examination when considering factors such as application time, sensitivity, specificity, and number of studies. However, there is a wide range of tests with different characteristics, therefore it is recommended that the professional gets some expertise in a few number of instruments in order to be able to choose which to use, or use in combination, depending on the setting and the profile of the patient."
"25017513","The prevalence and impact of undiagnosed cognitive impairment in older vascular surgical patients.","OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this observational cohort study were to investigate the prevalence of undiagnosed cognitive impairment in older patients presenting for vascular surgery, to examine its association with adverse postoperative outcomes, and to test the feasibility of a preoperative cognitive assessment tool.METHODS: Patients aged 60years or older were recruited by consent on admission to the vascular surgical ward of an inner-city teaching hospital with a large tertiary referral practice for proposed elective or emergency aortic or lower limb arterial intervention. Cognition was assessed preoperatively by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and a score below 24/30 indicated cognitive impairment or dementia. The mean length of time taken to complete the assessment was recorded. Baseline characteristics (medical multimorbidity, frailty, and laboratory tests), hospital length of stay (LOS), and postoperative complications were documented.RESULTS: Preoperative MoCA was completed in 114 patients with a mean age of 76.3years (standard deviation, 7.36years); 67.5% were men, and 55.3% of procedures were elective. The MoCA was completed in 100% of patients and was quick and acceptable to patients in this setting. Cognitive impairment or dementia was found in 68% of patients (77 of 114) and was previously unrecognized in 88.3% of patients (68 of 77). Therefore, 60.5% of patients (68 of 114) aged 60years or older presenting for vascular surgery had previously undiagnosed cognitive impairment. MoCA&lt;24 was univariately associated with pre-existing frailty (Edmonton Frail Scale [EFS] score =6.5) and longer LOS (=12days). In logistic regression modeling, MoCA&lt;24 was strongly independently associated with frailty EFS score =6.5 (odds ratio, 12.55; P&lt; .001). By use of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), MoCA&lt;24 was predictive of longer LOS of =12days (AUC, 0.621; P= .049). The strength of predictive power increased with the addition of frailty (EFS score =6.5) to the models (AUC, 0.695; P= .002).CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of cognitive impairment among older patients presenting for vascular surgery is high and frequently undiagnosed before admission. It is feasible to use the MoCA to identify cognitive impairment in this high-risk surgical group preoperatively. The combined assessment of frailty and cognition is predictive of adverse postoperative outcomes and longer LOS."
"24995445","The use of wide-scale mental agility testing to identify people at risk of dementia: crucial or harmful?","The prevalence of dementia in the UK is rising rapidly and is predicted to double over the next 30 years. The NHS in England has been told to push for a rapid rise in dementia diagnosis rates, so that by 2015, two out of three cases are identified. The Prime Minister has raised the 'dementia challenge' as a priority for the NHS. While there is agreement on the need for action, debate arises over the nature of that intervention. Some, including Professor Alessi, argue that tools exist to support the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and they should be used because the disease is amenable to interventions. He believes that we need a shift in knowledge and attitude from thresholds to a continuum of cognitive impairment, from late to early stages and from effects to causes. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCa) should become part of the routine NHS Health Check after people reach age 40. Dr Fox argues on the other hand that widespread testing could lead to unnecessary anxiety and panic among those at risk and that funding should be focused on learning more about the early stages of dementia. While the concept of early testing is appealing, there is a large knowledge gap; instruments in use have not been tested in pre-dementia patients and have limited validity. While there is debate over the approach, we can agree that the economic and social impacts of this condition need to be addressed sooner rather than later."
"24991170","Using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale to screen for dementia in Chinese patients with Parkinson's Disease.","BACKGROUND: Dementia is one of the most distressing and burdensome health problems associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale (MoCA) is widely used to screen for dementia in PD patients, but the appropriate diagnostic cutoff score when used with Chinese PD patients is not known.AIM: Determine a diagnostic cutoff value of the Chinese version of the MoCA (MoCA-C) for Chinese PD patients and describe the characteristics of PD patients screened positive for dementia using the MoCA-C.METHODS: The presence of dementia in 616 PD patients and 85 community controls was determined using the Movement Disorder Society Task Force criteria (the gold standard diagnosis). We administered the MoCA-C to these individuals and used a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to identify the cutoff score of the MoCA-C that most efficiently identified dementia in both PD patients and community controls. Demographic and clinical characteristics of PD patients who were screened positive or negative for dementia using the MoCA-C were compared.RESULTS: A MoCA-C score of 23 was the optimal cutoff score for dementia in both patients and controls. Using this cutoff score, the sensitivity and specificity of the MoCA-C in PD patients were 0.70 and 0.77, respectively; the positive and negative predictive values were 0.59 and 0.85, respectively; and the overall concordance (kappa [95% confidence interval]) was 0.45 (0.39-0.52). The corresponding kappa value (concordance) in community controls was only 0.25 (0.05-0.45). Compared to PD patients who screened negative for dementia, those who screened positive for dementia were significantly impaired in all cognitive domains, including visuospatial and executive functioning, naming, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall and orientation (all p&lt;0.001). Among the PD patients, screening positive for dementia was independently associated with old age, low educational attainment, female gender and more severe motor impairment.CONCLUSIONS: The commonly recommended cutoff screening score for dementia of 26 on the MoCA it too high for PD patients in China; a cutoff score of 23 is more appropriate. Potential risk factors for dementia in Chinese PD patients include older age, less education, and more severe motor symptoms of PD.MoCA-C 23<U+5206><U+662F><U+8BCA><U+65AD><U+5E15><U+91D1><U+68EE><U+6C0F><U+60A3><U+8005><U+53CA><U+5BF9><U+7167><U+7EC4><U+75F4><U+5446><U+7684><U+6700><U+4F73><U+5212><U+754C><U+5206><U+3002><U+4F7F><U+7528><U+8BE5><U+5212><U+754C><U+5206>,PD<U+60A3><U+8005><U+7684>MoCA-C<U+654F><U+611F><U+6027><U+548C><U+7279><U+5F02><U+6027><U+5206><U+522B><U+4E3A>0.70<U+548C>0.77,<U+9633><U+6027><U+548C><U+9634><U+6027><U+9884><U+6D4B><U+503C><U+5206><U+522B><U+4E3A>0.59<U+548C>0.85,<U+6574><U+4F53><U+4E00><U+81F4><U+6027>(kappa [95% <U+53EF><U+4FE1><U+533A><U+95F4>])<U+4E3A>0.45 (0.39-0.52)<U+3002><U+793E><U+533A><U+5BF9><U+7167><U+76F8><U+5E94><U+7684>kappa<U+503C> (<U+4E00><U+81F4><U+6027>)<U+4EC5><U+4E3A>0.25 (0.05-0.45)<U+3002><U+4E0E><U+7B5B><U+67E5><U+4E3A><U+75F4><U+5446><U+9634><U+6027><U+7684>PD<U+60A3><U+8005><U+76F8><U+6BD4>,<U+7B5B><U+67E5><U+4E3A><U+75F4><U+5446><U+9633><U+6027><U+7684>PD<U+60A3><U+8005><U+6240><U+6709><U+8BA4><U+77E5><U+529F><U+80FD><U+90FD><U+6709><U+663E><U+8457><U+53D7><U+635F>,<U+5305><U+62EC><U+89C6><U+89C9><U+7A7A><U+95F4><U+548C><U+6267><U+884C><U+529F><U+80FD>,<U+547D><U+540D>,<U+6CE8><U+610F><U+529B>,<U+8BED><U+8A00>,<U+62BD><U+8C61>,<U+5EF6><U+8FDF><U+56DE><U+5FC6><U+548C><U+5B9A><U+5411> (<U+5747>P&lt;0.001)<U+3002><U+5728><U+5E15><U+91D1><U+68EE><U+6C0F><U+75C7><U+60A3><U+8005><U+4E2D>,<U+7B5B><U+67E5><U+4E3A><U+75F4><U+5446><U+9633><U+6027><U+4E0E><U+5E74><U+8001>,<U+6587><U+5316><U+7A0B><U+5EA6><U+4F4E>,<U+5973><U+6027><U+4EE5><U+53CA><U+4E25><U+91CD><U+8FD0><U+52A8><U+969C><U+788D><U+72EC><U+7ACB><U+76F8><U+5173><U+3002></AbstractText>: MoCA-C 23<U+5206><U+662F><U+8BCA><U+65AD><U+5E15><U+91D1><U+68EE><U+6C0F><U+60A3><U+8005><U+53CA><U+5BF9><U+7167><U+7EC4><U+75F4><U+5446><U+7684><U+6700><U+4F73><U+5212><U+754C><U+5206><U+3002><U+4F7F><U+7528><U+8BE5><U+5212><U+754C><U+5206>,PD<U+60A3><U+8005><U+7684>MoCA-C<U+654F><U+611F><U+6027><U+548C><U+7279><U+5F02><U+6027><U+5206><U+522B><U+4E3A>0.70<U+548C>0.77,<U+9633><U+6027><U+548C><U+9634><U+6027><U+9884><U+6D4B><U+503C><U+5206><U+522B><U+4E3A>0.59<U+548C>0.85,<U+6574><U+4F53><U+4E00><U+81F4><U+6027>(kappa [95% <U+53EF><U+4FE1><U+533A><U+95F4>])<U+4E3A>0.45 (0.39-0.52)<U+3002><U+793E><U+533A><U+5BF9><U+7167><U+76F8><U+5E94><U+7684>kappa<U+503C> (<U+4E00><U+81F4><U+6027>)<U+4EC5><U+4E3A>0.25 (0.05-0.45)<U+3002><U+4E0E><U+7B5B><U+67E5><U+4E3A><U+75F4><U+5446><U+9634><U+6027><U+7684>PD<U+60A3><U+8005><U+76F8><U+6BD4>,<U+7B5B><U+67E5><U+4E3A><U+75F4><U+5446><U+9633><U+6027><U+7684>PD<U+60A3><U+8005><U+6240><U+6709><U+8BA4><U+77E5><U+529F><U+80FD><U+90FD><U+6709><U+663E><U+8457><U+53D7><U+635F>,<U+5305><U+62EC><U+89C6><U+89C9><U+7A7A><U+95F4><U+548C><U+6267><U+884C><U+529F><U+80FD>,<U+547D><U+540D>,<U+6CE8><U+610F><U+529B>,<U+8BED><U+8A00>,<U+62BD><U+8C61>,<U+5EF6><U+8FDF><U+56DE><U+5FC6><U+548C><U+5B9A><U+5411> (<U+5747>P&lt;0.001)<U+3002><U+5728><U+5E15><U+91D1><U+68EE><U+6C0F><U+75C7><U+60A3><U+8005><U+4E2D>,<U+7B5B><U+67E5><U+4E3A><U+75F4><U+5446><U+9633><U+6027><U+4E0E><U+5E74><U+8001>,<U+6587><U+5316><U+7A0B><U+5EA6><U+4F4E>,<U+5973><U+6027><U+4EE5><U+53CA><U+4E25><U+91CD><U+8FD0><U+52A8><U+969C><U+788D><U+72EC><U+7ACB><U+76F8><U+5173><U+3002>"
"24987404","Screening for impaired cognitive domains in a large Parkinson's disease population and its application to the diagnostic procedure for Parkinson's disease dementia.","BACKGROUND: Dementia is a new focus of research on improved treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). In 2007, a screening tool for PD dementia (PD-D) was developed by the Movement Disorder Society (Level I testing), which still requires verification by a large population study.METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional and multicenter study including 13 institutions administering the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to 304 PD patients (mean age: 70.6  8.3 years; mean Hoehn and Yahr stage: 2.7  0.7).RESULTS: In all, 34.5% of the patients had MMSE scores &lt;26; 94.3% of these patients had impairments in =2 cognitive domains and met the criteria for probable PD-D by Level I testing. Executive dysfunction combined with attention and memory impairment was most common (51.4%). In the Level I subtests of executive function, the score for phonemic fluency declined by &lt;50% in patients with high MoCA scores (24-30 points) and lacked specificity for PD-D. No patient had visuospatial impairment (measured by the pentagon copying subtest) alone, and the score for pentagon copying stayed at =70% even in patients with low MMSE scores (12-25 points), therefore lacking sensitivity for PD-D.CONCLUSIONS: Level I testing with administration of the MMSE and MoCA is a practical and efficient screening tool for PD-D. However, the phonemic fluency and pentagon copying tests should be replaced by more specific/sensitive ones when screening for PD-D."
"24987399","Comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of neuropsychological tests in differentiating Alzheimer's disease from mild cognitive impairment: can the montreal cognitive assessment be better than the cambridge cognitive examination?","OBJECTIVE: Considering the lack of studies on measures that increase the diagnostic distinction between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and on the role of the Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG) in this, our study aims to compare the utility of the CAMCOG, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in helping to differentiate AD from MCI in elderly people with &gt;4 years of schooling.METHOD: A total of 136 elderly subjects - 39 normal controls as well as 52 AD patients and 45 MCI patients treated at the Institute of Geriatrics and Gerontology, Porto Alegre, Brazil - were assessed using the MMSE, CAMCOG, clock drawing test (CDT), verbal fluency test (VF), Geriatric Depression Scale and Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire.RESULTS: The results obtained by means of a receiver operating characteristic curve showed that the MoCA is a better screening test for differentiating elderly subjects with AD from those with MCI than the CAMCOG and MMSE as well as other tests such as the CDT and VF.CONCLUSION: The MoCA, more than the CAMCOG and the other tests, was shown to be able to differentiate AD from MCI, although, as Roalf et al. [Alzheimers Dement 2013;9:529-537] pointed out, further studies might lead to measures that will improve this differentiation."
"24982978","The influence of education on Chinese version of Montreal cognitive assessment in detecting amnesic mild cognitive impairment among older people in a Beijing rural community.","To assess the influence of education on the performance of Chinese version of Montreal cognitive assessment (C-MoCA) in relation to the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) in detecting amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) among rural-dwelling older people C-MoCA and MMSE was administered and diagnostic interviews were conducted among community-dwelling elderly in two villages in Beijing. The performance of C-MoCA and MMSE in detecting aMCI was evaluated by the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Effect size of education on variations in C-MoCA scores was estimated with general linear model. Among 172 study participants (24 cases of aMCI and 148 normal controls), the AUC of C-MoCA was 0.72 (95% CI = 0.62-0.81, cutoff = 20/21), compared to AUC of MMSE of 0.74 (95% CI = 0.64-0.84, cutoff = 26/27). The performance of both C-MoCA and MMSE was especially poorer among those with low (0-6 years) education. After controlling for gender and age, education ( <U+03B7>(2) = 0.204) had a surpassing effect over aMCI diagnosis ( <U+03B7>(2) = 0.052) on variations in C-MoCA scores. Among rural older people, the MoCA showed modest accuracy and was no better than MMSE in detecting aMCI, especially in those with low education, due to the overwhelming effect of education relative to aMCI diagnosis on variations in C-MoCA performance."
"24972908","Stroop interference and AQT cognitive speed may play complementary roles in differentiating dementias with frontal and posterior lesions.","Forty neurotypical adults (ages 65-74) were administered three different assessments, as follows: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), A Quick Test of Cognitive Speed (AQT), and Stroop Color and Word Test. Correlation coefficients (Pearson r) indicated a significant but moderate association between MoCA scores and AQT dual-dimension processing speed (p &lt; 0.01). AQT color and color-form combination naming correlated significantly with Stroop Color, Word, and Color-Word t-scores, and the observed statistical power was high. Form naming correlated significantly with Stroop Word and Color-Word measures (p &lt; 0.01). The associations between the AQT color, form, and color-form combination and Stroop interference measures were low and non-significant (p &gt; 0.01). Based on evidence of frontal lobe control of inhibition (Stroop) and bilateral temporal-parietal control of dual-dimension processing speed (AQT), results suggest that the AQT dual-dimension processing-speed and Stroop interference tests may complement each other in differentiating dementias associated with frontal and posterior lesions."

"24906968","Acupuncture stimulation of Taichong (Liv3) and Hegu (LI4) modulates the default mode network activity in Alzheimer's disease.","OBJECTIVES: The acupuncture has been used in the therapy of Alzheimer disease (AD), however, its neural underpins are still unclear. The aim of this study is to examine the acupuncture effect on the default mode network (DMN) in AD by using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI).METHODS: Twenty-eight subjects (14 AD and 14 normal controls (NC)) participated in this study. RS-fMRI data were acquired before and after acupuncture, while during the acupuncture, the procession of acupuncture stimulation on the acupoints of Tai chong (Liv3) and Hegu (LI4) lasted for 3 minutes.RESULTS: Region of interest analysis showed that the impaired DMN connectivity in AD (identified by comparing the pre-acupuncture RS-fMRI of AD and NC), specifically the left cingulate gyrus (CG) and right inferior parietal lobule (IPL), were significantly changed for the better. The whole-brain exploratory analysis further demonstrated these results and found some new regions respond to the acupuncture effect on AD, with a cluster in the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG) together with right IPL showed increased within-DMN connectivity; and the bilateral CG and left PCu showed decreased within-DMN connectivity. Moreover, the acupuncture effect on the right MTG was significantly correlated with disease severity as measured by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores.CONCLUSION: It was found that the acupuncture stimulation could modulate the DMN activity in AD. The current findings suggest that the acupuncture treatment on the relative earlier AD patients might have a better therapy effect."
"24884485","Potential biomarkers relating pathological proteins, neuroinflammatory factors and free radicals in PD patients with cognitive impairment: a cross-sectional study.","BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment strikingly reduces the quality of life of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Studies find that pathological proteins, neuroinflammatory factors and free radicals may involve in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment of PD, however, results are inconclusive.METHODS: We recruited 62 PD patients and 31 healthy controls. PD patients were identified with cognitive impairment, including PD with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and PD with dementia (PDD) according to the diagnostic criteria for PD-MCI and PDD issued by Movement Disorder Society Task Force. The levels of pathological proteins, including -amyloid 1-42 (A1-42),Total-tau (T-tau) and phosphorelated tau (P-tau), neuroinflammatory factors,including tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-<U+03B3> (INF-<U+03B3>) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), free radicals, including hydroxyl radical (OH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO) in cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) were detected. The levels of above factors in CSF were compared among healthy controls and patients with and without cognitive impairment. Correlation analyses were performed between Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score and the levels of above factors in CSF.RESULTS: T-tau level in CSF from PD-CI patients are significantly elevated comparing with those without cognitive impairment and controls (P = 0.016 and 0.004, respectively). The levels of P-tau (S396) and  OH in PD-CI patients are significantly higher than controls (P = 0.001 and 0.014, respectively). IL-6 levels in PD-CI patients are strikingly enhanced comparing with those without cognitive impairment (P = 0.005). MoCA score is negatively correlated with the levels of T-tau (r = -0.340), P-tau (S396) (r = -0.448), IL-6 (r = -0.489) and  OH (r = -0.504) in PD-CI patients.CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of T-tau, P-tau (S396), IL-6 and  OH in CSF are significantly correlated with cognitive impairment in PD patients. This investigation may suggest the potential biomarkers relating pathological proteins, neuroinflammatory factors and free radicals in PD patients with cognitive impairment."

Among the cognitive assessments, MoCA showed the highest correlation (R <U+200A>=<U+200A> 0.56-0.62) with both LNG and ENV, reflecting that MoCA is the most sensitive and reliable screening for dementia in PD.DISCUSSION: The present study showed that posturography is useful to quantify the pulsion severity in PD patients, that pulsion severity and cognitive function showed a good correlation especially assessed by MoCA, and that posturography thus provides a more detailed quantitative correlation of postural instability to cognitive impairment."
"24829061","Correlational analysis of 5 commonly used measures of cognitive functioning and mental status: an update.","There are numerous measures for detecting the presence of dementia and quantifying its severity and progression. We analyzed the relations between scores on 5 commonly used measures (Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale, Activities of Daily Living Scale, and Global Deterioration Scale) of 101 successive admissions to a memory clinic. Patients were included in the analysis only if they received a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiological process or probable AD and if they received all measures. Regression analysis yielded 20 linear equations that allow for conversion between test scores on any 2 measures. Further, participants were grouped by MMSE scores with regard to level of disease severity, allowing for the creation of a quick reference table for estimating an approximate score range between measures. Results from this study provide a useful tool for clinicians when comparing between multiple different instruments that measure the mental status and functional ability of individuals with AD and MCI due to AD pathology."
"24806666","Contributions of the Computer-Administered Neuropsychological Screen for Mild Cognitive Impairment (CANS-MCI) for the diagnosis of MCI in Brazil.","ABSTRACT Background: The Computer-Administered Neuropsychological Screen for Mild Cognitive Impairment (CANS-MCI) is a computer-based cognitive screening instrument that involves automated administration and scoring and immediate analyses of test sessions. The objective of this study was to translate and culturally adapt the Brazilian Portuguese version of the CANS-MCI (CANS-MCI-BR) and to evaluate its reliability and validity for the diagnostic screening of MCI and dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Methods: The test was administered to 97 older adults (mean age 73.41  5.27 years) with at least four years of formal education (mean education 12.23  4.48 years). Participants were classified into three diagnostic groups according to global cognitive status (normal controls, n = 41; MCI, n = 35; AD, n = 21) based on clinical data and formal neuropsychological assessments. Results: The results indicated high internal consistency (Cronbach's a = 0.77) in the total sample. Three-month test-retest reliability correlations were significant and robust (0.875; p &lt; 0.001). A moderate level of concurrent validity was attained relative to the screening test for MCI (MoCA test, r = 0.76, p &lt; 0.001). Confirmatory factor analysis supported the three-factor model of the original test, i.e., memory, language/spatial fluency, and executive function/mental control. Goodness of fit indicators were strong (Bentler Comparative Fit Index = 0.96, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.09). Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses suggested high sensitivity and specificity (81% and 73% respectively) to screen for possible MCI cases. Conclusions: The CANS-MCI-BR maintains adequate psychometric characteristics that render it suitable to identify elderly adults with probable cognitive impairment to whom a more extensive evaluation by formal neuropsychological tests may be required."
"24746932","Comparisons of cognitive function and serum S-100B level between diabetic and non-diabetic patients after the implantation of carotid artery stent (CAS).","To investigate cognitive function improvement in diabetic and non-diabetic patients after the implantation of Carotid Artery Stent (CAS), 128 patients suffering severe carotid stenosis were successfully enrolled in this study. Tests including, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), Clock Drawing Test (CDT), Hasegawa's Dementia Scale-Revised (HDS-R) and the serum levels of S-100B, were all measured at baseline for 3 months after the implantation of CAS. The baseline characteristics were similar between the patients with and without diabetes. 3 months after the implantation, significant improvements in MMSE (24.8  2.2 vs. 25.2  2.1, p=0.003), MoCA (25.6  2.0 vs. 26.1  1.9, p=0.000), ADAS-Cog (6.5  1.3 vs. 6.1  1.3, p=0.000), and CDT (3.3  0.7 vs. 3.5  0.7, p=0.034) were observed in the non-diabetic group. In contrast, there was no significant improvement in any of the cognitive test for the diabetic group. Another interesting discovery was the CAS procedure significantly decreased the S-100B level in the non-diabetic group (0.11  0.04 ng/mL vs. 0.10  0.04 ng/mL, p=0.000), but similar phenomena were not discovered in the diabetic group. In this light, the change of the S-100B level was negatively correlated with the results in the MMSE (p&lt;0.01) and the MoCA (p&lt;0.01) tests, and positively correlated with the result in ADAS-Cog (p&lt;0.05) test. Our findings suggest that the CAS-induced beneficial effects on cognitive function might have a correlation relationship with the serum level of S-100B."
"24745159","[The effect of prolactin and apolipoprotein E gene polymorphism on cognitive functions of menopausal women].","OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to analyze a possible association between cognitive functions and level of prolactin in menopausal women with different polymorphisms of apolipoprotein E gene (APOE). The examined population included women from the south-eastern part of Poland; aged 50-65 years; at least 2 years after their last menstruation; in good health; with at least primary education, FSH &gt; 30 mIU/ml. The MoCA test (Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test) allowed us to exclude women with signs of dementia. The cognitive functions assessment was conducted with the CNS-VitalSigns diagnostic equipment (Polish version). The prolactin designations were conducted by SYNEVO--an accredited laboratory. The examination of APOE polymorphism was performed using the multiplex-PCR method. The results were statistically analyzed.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Higher level of prolactin turned out to be associated with better test results in the following areas: NCI, memory verbal memory psychomotor speed and concentration. Women with higher level of prolactin had better results in NCI, psychomotor speed and verbal memory tests. The test results of other cognitive function were not unequivocally related to higher levels of prolactin. Thus, it was not possible to conclude that the presence of APOE polymorphism is related to the effect of prolactin on cognitive functions of the examined menopausal women."
"24641691","Impact of regional white matter lesions on cognitive function in subcortical vascular cognitive impairment.","OBJECTIVES: Exact characterization and localization of white matter lesions (WMLs) as they relate and contribute to vascular cognitive impairment is highly debated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of WML on cognitive function by using a new anatomy-based classification method.METHODS: We detected WML accurately by using a three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (3D FLAIR) imaging technique and subsequently segmented WMLs by using an anatomy-based method. Participants included 56 consecutive patients diagnosed with subcortical vascular cognitive impairment (SubVCI). The volume of WMLs in different anatomic regions was measured. The volume of the hippocampus, the corpus callosum (CC), any lacunar infarcts, total gray matter (GM), and total brain volumes were also calculated.RESULTS: Hippocampal (P <U+200A>=<U+200A> 0.005) as well as temporal WML volumes (P <U+200A>=<U+200A> 0.039) were both independently associated with mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score. Only the parietal WML volume (P <U+200A>=<U+200A> 0.000) was independently associated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score. Frontal WMLs were independently correlated with executive function. Occipital WMLs were independently associated with visuospatial and recall function. Language impairment was independently correlated with both parietal GM and parietal WML volume. Functions related to orientation were independently associated with parietal WML volume.DISCUSSION: The volume of WMLs in the temporal region as well as in the hippocampus were both independently associated with MMSE score. For the MoCA score, however, only parietal WML volumes were independently correlated. White matter lesions within different anatomic regions were separately correlated with different subdomains of cognitive function."

Individuals with multiple-domain amnestic MCI had the highest AD conversion rates (73.9%).CONCLUSION: Identifying individuals with MCI at high risk of conversion to AD is important clinically and for selecting appropriate subjects for therapeutic trials. Individuals with MCI with a low MoCA-TS and a low newly devised memory index score (MoCA-MIS) are at greater risk of short-term conversion to AD."

Persons were classified into two groups according to whether they have severe edentulism (&lt;10 remaining teeth) or not. In addition, a questionnaire allowed self-rating of oral health. A total of 274 persons (mean age 69.6  7.7 years; 59% women) were included. Persons with &lt;10 remaining teeth (n = 116) have significantly lower MoCA scores than those with =10 teeth (n =158), after adjusting for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, depression and dementia ( = -1.06, p = 0.03). Self-rated poor oral health was more prevalent among persons with &lt;10 teeth (p &lt; 0.0001), but did not correlate with MoCA scores (good vs. poor,  = -0.89, p = 0.89). Severe edentulism is associated with poor cognitive performance in elders living in rural Ecuador.

We sought to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for HAND in HIV-infected Koreans. In addition, we investigated the performance of screening tools and components of neuropsychological (NP) tests for diagnosing HAND.METHODS: HIV-infected patients were enrolled consecutively from two different urban teaching hospitals in Seoul, South Korea between March 2012 and September 2012. Participants completed a detailed NP assessment of six cognitive domains commonly affected by HIV. The Frascati criteria were used for diagnosing HAND. Four key questions, the International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)-K were also assessed as potential tools for screening for HAND.RESULTS: Among the 194 participants, the prevalence of HAND was 26.3%. Asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment and minor neurocognitive disorder accounted for 52.9 and 47.1% of the patients with HAND, respectively. In multivariate analysis, haemoglobin (Hb) level =<U+2009>13<U+2009>g/dL (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.046) and current use of a protease inhibitor-based regimen (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.031) were independent risk factors for HAND. The sensitivity and specificity of the IHDS were 72.6 and 60.8%, and those of MoCA-K were 52.9 and 73.4%, respectively. The IHDS (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) and MoCA-K (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) were both useful for screening for HAND. Among NP tests, the sensitivity and specificity of the Grooved Pegboard Test were 90.2 and 72.0%, and those of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test were 61.2 and 84.4%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: HAND is a prevalent comorbidity in HIV-infected Koreans. Active screening and diagnosis with effective tools, such as the IHDS, MoCA-K and Grooved Pegboard Test, could be used to identify this important complication."

The authors examined validity of MoCA and discriminating power of subtests in a Turkish population comprising of 474 participants (246 healthy controls, 114 subjects with MCI and 114 subjects with dementia). The ANCOVAs showed that age and education had a main effect on MoCA scores. Cut scores were computed according to different education levels. The overall cut-off values for MCI and dementia were found to be lower compared to western studies. MoCA was found to have good internal consistency. The subtests most useful in discriminating MCI from healthy controls were recall, visuospatial and language, while in discriminating dementia from MCI were visuospatial, orientation and attention subtests. The results demonstrated that MoCA is a valid and reliable instrument in screening MCI, and compared with the MMSE, MoCA was proved to have superior sensitivity and specificity in detecting MCI. "

The sensitivity of ADL scale or IADL-4 item or the MMSE was low (52%-57%). The most efficient AD classification used both the IADLs-4 item and the MOCA with a threshold score of 20. Besides age and memory scores, the main correlates of IADLs scale or ADLs scale were executive, neuropsychiatric, vascular, and extrapyramidal scores.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the Lawton IADLs-4 item scale and ADLs scale lack sensitivity to AD dementia in elderly people and support a better sensitivity of MOCA rather than MMSE and IADLs-4 item/ADLs at the expense of specificity."

Demographics, vascular risk factors, and stroke data were collected. A first cognitive evaluation was performed during the hospitalization using the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA). Patients assessable at 3 months were categorized as cognitively impaired if the MMSE score was =26/30 and MOCA &lt;26/30 or if the neuropsychological battery confirmed PSCI when the MMSE and MOCA were discordant. Multivariable logistic models were used to determine factors associated with 3-month PSCI.RESULTS: Among the 280 patients included, 220 were assessable at 3 months. The overall frequency of 3-month PSCI was 47.3%, whereas that of dementia was 7.7%. In multivariable analyses, 3-month PSCI was associated with age, low education level, a history of diabetes mellitus, acute confusion, silent infarcts, and functional handicap at discharge. MMSE and MOCA scores during hospitalization were associated with 3-month PSCI (OR = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.54-0.74; p &lt; 0.0001 and OR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.59-0.76; p &lt; 0.0001, respectively).CONCLUSION: Our study underlines the high frequency of PSCI in a cohort of mild stroke. The early cognitive diagnosis of stroke patients could be useful by helping physicians to identify those at a high risk of developing PSCI."

"24498389","Abnormal intrinsic brain activity patterns in patients with subcortical ischemic vascular dementia.","OBJECTIVES: To investigate the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) alteration of whole brain in patients with subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with SIVD and 35 control subjects were included in this study. All of them underwent structural MRI and rs-fMRI scan. The structural data were processed using the voxel-based morphometry 8 toolbox (VBM8). The rs-fMRI data were processed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) and Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF) software. Within-group analysis was performed with a one-sample Student's t-test to identify brain regions with ALFF value larger than the mean. Intergroup analysis was performed with a two-sample Student's t-test to identify ALFF differences of whole brain between SIVD and control subjects. Partial correlations between ALFF values and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were analyzed in the SIVD group across the parameters of age, gender, years of education, and GM volume.RESULTS: Within-group analysis showed that the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), inferior parietal lobe (IPL), occipital lobe, and adjacent precuneus had significantly higher standardized ALFF values than the global mean ALFF value in both groups. Compared to the controls, patients with SIVD presented lower ALFF values in the bilateral precuneus and higher ALFF values in the bilateral ACC, left insula and hippocampus. Including GM volume as an extra covariate, the ALFF inter-group difference exhibited highly similar spatial patterns to those without GM volume correcting. Close negative correlations were found between the ALFF values of left insula and the MoCA and MMSE scores of SIVD patients.CONCLUSION: SIVD is associated with a unique spontaneous aberrant activity of rs-fMRI signals, and measurement of ALFF in the precuneus, ACC, insula, and hippocampus may aid in the detection of SIVD."
"24464001","Cognitive functions, apolipoprotein E genotype and hormonal replacement therapy of postmenopausal women.","OBJECTIVE: The results of many studies revealed that estrogen plus progestogen therapy (EPT) may modify dementia development risk in relation to the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) polymorphisms. However, the mechanism and subsequently clinical importance of such an effect are still unexplained. The objective of this study was to explore the influence of EPT on cognitive functioning of women in their postmenopausal life in relation to APOE polymorphism.METHODS: The group of 214 women was recruited (106 out of this group with EPT) to the study. The inclusion criteria were: minimum two years after the last menstruation, FSH concentration over 30 U/ml and no dementia signs on Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Computerized battery of Central Nervous System Vital Signs (CNS VS) test was used to diagnostic cognitive functions. APOE genotype was performed by multiplex PCR. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way analysis of variance in STATISTICA software.RESULTS &amp; CONCLUSION: The women after menopause have reduced neurocognitive index (NCI) and cognitive functions. NCI and all studied cognitive functions of the patients depended significantly on APOE polymorphisms. The presence of APOE4 corresponded with decreased cognitive functions as opposed to APOE2 which was present in women with better level of cognitive functions. Constantly using EPT correlated with three cognitive functions: memory, verbal memory and processing speed, which were significantly worse for women taking EPT than not taking ones. The interaction between APOE polymorphisms and EPT application was significant only for processing speed. EPT applying women with e2/e3 and e4 obtained better scores in processing speed than women not taking EPT with these APOE polymorphisms. The opposite situation concerned women with e3/e3, women taking EPT achieved worse processing scores in comparison with those not taking EPT. It should be noted that APOE polymorphism assessment may be a factor in predicting the effect of EPT on cognitive functioning in postmenopausal period."
"24443573","[Hungarian version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) for screening mild cognitive impairment].","Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be considered as an intermediate stage between normal cognitive aging and dementia. Its screening is extremely important because within a year in 15-20% of cases dementia can evolve. In Hungary, the most widely used screening tool for both dementia and MCI is the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), which is often criticized for its poor screening sensitivity of mild dementia and MCI. To eliminate this problem, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was developed, especially for screening MCI. Our study presents the first results with the Hungarian translation of MoCA. We used Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) for controlling depression. In MoCA the cutoff score between healthy and MCI persons was 24 out of 30. MoCA was more sensitive in detecting MCI than MMSE and its inner consistency was also slightly higher. Specificity of the tests to detect MCI was similar. The results on BDI were not related to either MoCA or MMSE. Our results suggest that MoCA can be a useful tool to detect cognitive decline. "

VCI was defined by impairment in any cognitive domain on neuropsychological testing. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to compare test discriminatory ability.RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-nine patients out of 327 (58%) had VCI, of whom 180 (95%) had vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI), and nine (5%) had dementia. The overall AUCs of the MoCA and MMSE scores and performance at their respective cut-off points were equivalent in detecting VCI (AUCs: 0.87 (95% CI 0.83-0.91) vs. 0.84 (95% CI 0.80-0.88), p = 0.13; cut-offs: MoCA (=23) vs. MMSE (=26), sensitivity: 0.78 vs. 0.71; specificity: 0.80 vs. 0.82; positive predictive value: 0.84 vs. 0.84; negative predictive value: 0.72 vs. 0.67; and correctly classified 78.6% vs. 75.5%; p = 0.42).

The clinical diagnosis was established through the consensus of a multidisciplinary team, based on international criteria. The results demonstrated an overall good fit of both items and the person's values, a high variability on cognitive performance level, and a good quality of the measurements. The MoCA scores also demonstrated adequate discriminant validity, with high diagnostic value. DIF analyses indicated the generalized validity of the MoCA scores. In conclusion, the results of this study show the overall psychometric adequacy of the MoCA and verify the discriminant and generalized validity of the obtained results. "
"24395708","Predictors of cognitive impairment in an early stage Parkinson's disease cohort.","The impact of Parkinson's disease (PD) dementia is substantial and has major functional and socioeconomic consequences. Early prediction of future cognitive impairment would help target future interventions. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and fluency tests were administered to 486 patients with PD within 3.5 years of diagnosis, and the results were compared with those from 141 controls correcting for age, sex, and educational years. Eighteen-month longitudinal assessments were performed in 155 patients with PD. The proportion of patients classified with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia varied considerably, depending on the MoCA and MMSE thresholds used. With the MoCA total score at screening threshold, 47.7%, 40.5%, and 11.7% of patients with PD were classified with normal cognition, MCI, and dementia, respectively; by comparison, 78.7% and 21.3% of controls had normal cognition and MCI, respectively. Cognitive impairment was predicted by lower education, increased age, male sex, and quantitative motor and non-motor (smell, depression, and anxiety) measures. Longitudinal data from 155 patients with PD over 18 months showed significant reductions in MoCA scores, but not in MMSE scores, with 21.3% of patients moving from normal cognition to MCI and 4.5% moving from MCI to dementia, although 13.5% moved from MCI to normal; however, none of the patients with dementia changed their classification. The MoCA may be more sensitive than the MMSE in detecting early baseline and longitudinal cognitive impairment in PD, because it identified 25.8% of those who experienced significant cognitive decline over 18 months. Cognitive decline was associated with worse motor and non-motor features, suggesting that this reflects a faster progressive phenotype."

Postural function and balance control were assessed by computerized static (&quot;Stabilan 01&quot; Russia) and dynamic (&quot;Gravistat&quot;, Belarus) stabiloplatforms using a biofeedback principle.RESULTS: In the static stabiloplatform examination more pronounced postural instability in VaMCI patients was evidenced by larger gravity center displacement radius (p &lt; 0.05) and confidence ellipse area (p &lt; 0.05). In the dynamic stabiloplatform examination it was manifested by the reduced number of errors as attempts to maintain postural stability (p &lt; 0.0001), a decrease in the error rate (p &lt; 0.0001) and increase in the average time of a postural response as time spent for one error (p &lt; 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical postural instability detected by the stabiloplatform examinations may be of value in earlier VaMCI diagnosis."
"26713170","Rapid Screening for Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson's Disease: A Pilot Study.","Aim. This study sought to establish the discriminant validity of a rapid cognitive screen, that is, the National Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network (NINDS-CSN) 5-minute protocol, and compare its discriminant validity to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) in detecting cognitive impairment (CI) in PD patients. Methods. One hundred and one PD patients were recruited from a movement disorders clinic in Singapore and they received the NINDS-CSN 5-minute protocol, MoCA, and MMSE. No cognitive impairment (NCI) was defined as Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) = 0 and CI was defined as CDR = 0.5. Results. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of NINDS-CSN 5-minute protocol was statistically equivalent to MoCA and larger than MMSE (0.86 versus 0.90, P = 0.07; 0.86 versus 0.76, P = 0.03). The sensitivity of NINDS-CSN 5-minute protocol (&lt;9) was statistically equivalent to MoCA (&lt;22) (0.77 versus 0.85, P = 0.13) and superior to MMSE (&lt;24) (0.77 versus 0.52, P &lt; 0.01) in detecting CI, while the specificity of NINDS-CSN 5-minute protocol (&lt;9) was statistically equivalent to MoCA (&lt;22) and MMSE (&lt;24) (0.78 versus 0.88, P = 0.34). Conclusion. The NINDS-CSN 5-minute protocol is time expeditious while remaining statistically equivalent to MoCA and superior to MMSE and therefore is suitable for rapid cognitive screening of CI in PD patients.

"26682683","Reduction of Amyloid- Plasma Levels by Hemodialysis: An Anti-Amyloid Treatment Strategy?","BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients is common, but the underlying pathogenesis remains unclear. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the general elderly population. Histopathological hallmarks are, among others, senile plaques, which consist of amyloid- (A).OBJECTIVE: To measure plasma levels of A42 and A40 during hemodialysis and to examine potential associations with cognitive performance in cognitively impaired hemodialysis patients.METHODS: Plasma samples of 26 hemodialysis patients were collected shortly before, after 50% of dialysis time, and at the end of a dialysis session. A42 and A40 levels were measured by a high-sensitivity ELISA for human amyloid-. Cognition was tested under standardized conditions using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as proposed previously.RESULTS: Clearance rates of both peptides during one dialysis session were 22% and 35% for A42 and A40, respectively. A42 but not A40 baseline levels were significantly associated with MoCA test results (r<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.654, p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.001).CONCLUSION: In cognitively impaired hemodialysis patients plasma A42 levels were associated with cognitive performance and both A42 and A40 plasma levels could be effectively reduced by dialysis. By inducing peripheral A sink, hemodialysis may be considered as an anti-amyloid treatment strategy."
"26667660","Changes in Cognitive Status in COPD Patients Across Clinical Stages.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive disease, its prevalence increases with age. COPD is frequently associated with co-morbidities such as cognitive impairment, and their clinical relevance has risen in the recent past. Cognitive function may fluctuate with the variable components of COPD like hypoxaemia, hypercapnia, lung function, exacerbations or severity of the disease. The objectives of this study were to examine whether the cognitive status of COPD patients is different across clinical stages (exacerbation, at discharge and stable COPD) and also if there are cognitive areas that have more potential to change than others. Prospective observational clinical study: 62 patients admitted to hospital due to acute exacerbation of COPD were evaluated at hospital admission; 61 at discharge; and finally, 48 patients with stable COPD completed the study and were included in the analysis. Cognitive status was assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Our results show that all clinical variables improved from exacerbation to discharge COPD. MoCA total score, visuoconstructional, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall and orientation subscores improved significantly from exacerbation to discharge COPD (p &lt; 0.05). MoCA total score, visuoconstructional and naming subscores worsened significantly from discharge to stable COPD (p &lt; 0.05). Finally, from exacerbation to stable COPD all the clinical variables improved; MoCA total score and naming, attention, language, abstraction and delayed recall subscores have shown significant differences (p &lt; 0.05). Cognitive status of COPD patients is different across clinical stages, and there are cognitive areas with more potential to change than others. "
"26648041","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Basic: A Screening Tool for Mild Cognitive Impairment in Illiterate and Low-Educated Elderly Adults.","OBJECTIVES: To assess the validity of a newly developed cognitive screening tool, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Basic (MoCA-B), in screening for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in elderly adults with low education and varying literacy.DESIGN: Cross-sectional.SETTING: Community hospital in Bangkok, Thailand.PARTICIPANTS: Cognitively normal controls (n = 43) and individuals with MCI according to the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association work group criteria (n = 42) aged 55 to 80 with less than 5 years of education.MEASUREMENTS: MoCA-B scores.RESULTS: Mean MoCA-B scores were 26.3  1.6 for illiterate controls and 21.3  3.8 for illiterate participants with MCI (P &lt; .001) and 26.6  2.0 for literate controls and 23.0  2.1 for literate participants with MCI (P &lt; .001). MoCA-B scores did not differ significantly according to literacy, and multiple regression suggested no association with age or education. The optimal cutoff score of 24 out of 25 yielded 81% sensitivity and 86% specificity for MCI (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.90, P &lt; .001). Test-retest reliability was 0.91 (P &lt; .001), and internal consistency was 0.82. Administration time was 15 to 21 minutes.CONCLUSION: The MoCA-B appears to have excellent validity and addresses an unmet need by accurately screening for MCI in poorly educated older adults regardless of literacy."
"26620850","A subtest analysis of the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA): which subtests can best discriminate between healthy controls, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease?","BACKGROUND: It is necessary to continue to explore the psychometric characteristics of key cognitive screening tests such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to diagnose cognitive decline as early as possible and to attend to the growing need of clinical trials involving mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants. The main aim of this study was to assess which MoCA subtests could best discriminate between healthy controls (HC), participants with MCI, and Alzheimer's disease (AD).METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of 136 elderly with more than four years of education. All participants were submitted to detailed clinical, laboratory, and neuroimaging evaluation. The MoCA, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) were applied to all participants. The MoCA test was not used in the diagnostic procedure.RESULTS: Median MoCA total scores were 27, 23 and 18 for HC, MCI, and AD, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Word repetition, inverse digits, serial 7, phrases, verbal fluency, abstraction, and word recall discriminated between MCI and HC participants (p &lt; 0.001). The clock drawing, the rhino naming, delayed recall of five words and orientation discriminated between patients with MCI and AD (p &lt; 0.001). A reduced version of the MoCA with only these items did not improve accuracy between MCI and HC (p = 0.076) or MCI and AD (p = 0.119).CONCLUSIONS: Not all MoCA subtests might be fundamental to clinical diagnosis of MCI. The reduced versions of MoCA did not add diagnostic accuracy."
"26613992","Assessment of Mental Status.","Assessing the mental status of patients with a neurobehavioral disorder is a critical element in the diagnosis and treatment of these patients. This assessment should always be performed after the patient's history it taken and a general physical as well as a neurologic examination is completed. The mental status examination commences with observing the patient's appearance and level of consciousness. The examiner should also pay attention to patient's social behavior, emotional state and mood. There are 3 major means of assessing a patient's mental status. One type attempts to determine if the patient is demented and the severity of the dementia as it pertains to their ability to perform activities of daily living as well as instrumental activities. A second type of assessment utilizes what may be termed as &quot;screening tests&quot; or &quot;omnibus tests&quot;. These brief tests are performed independent of the patient's history and examination. The two most frequently used screening tests are the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The third means of assessing a patient's mental status is by using specific neuropsychological tests that focus on specific domains of cognition, such as frontal executive functions, attention, episodic verbal and visuospatial memory, declarative knowledge such as language (speech, reading and writing) and arithmetical, as well as visuospatial and perceptual abilities. These neurobehavioral, neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological assessments of patients with a cognitive decline and behavioral abnormalities should often be accompanied by laboratory tests, and neuroimaging that can help determine the underlying pathologic process so that effective therapeutic and management approaches can be provided.

"26588918","Domain-specific versus generalized cognitive screening in acute stroke.","Cognitive assessments after stroke are typically short form tests developed for dementia that generates pass/fail classifications (e.g. the MoCA). The Oxford Cognitive Screen (OCS) provides a domain-specific cognitive profile designed for stroke survivors. This study compared the use of the MoCA and the OCS in acute stroke with respect to symptom specificity and aspects of clinical utility. A cross-sectional study with a consecutive sample of 200 stroke patients within 3 weeks of stroke completing MoCA and OCS. Demographic data, lesion side and Barthel scores were recorded. Inclusivity was assessed in terms of completion rates and reasons for non-completion were evaluated. The incidence of cognitive impairments on both the MoCA and OCS sub-domains was calculated and differences in stroke specificity, cognitive profiles and independence of the measures were addressed. The incidence of acute cognitive impairment was high: 76% of patients were impaired on MoCA, and 86% demonstrated at least one impairment on the cognitive domains assessed in the OCS. OCS was more sensitive than MoCA overall (87 vs 78% sensitivity) and OCS alone provided domain-specific information on prevalent post-stroke cognitive impairments (neglect, apraxia and reading/writing ability). Unlike the MOCA, the OCS was not dominated by left hemisphere impairments but gave differentiated profiles across the contrasting domains. The OCS detects important cognitive deficits after stroke not assessed in the MoCA, it is inclusive for patients with aphasia and neglect and it is less confounded by co-occurring difficulties in these domains."
"26578953","C-Reactive Protein, Advanced Glycation End Products, and Their Receptor in Type 2 Diabetic, Elderly Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate serum levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to determine the predictors (including AGEs, RAGE, and CRP levels) of having MCI in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes.METHODS: Two hundred seventy-six diabetics elders were screened for MCI (using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment: MoCA score). Data of biochemical parameters and biomarkers were collected.RESULTS: Serum AGEs, RAGE, and CRP levels were significantly increased in MCI patients compared to controls. In group of patients with MCI, serum RAGE level was positively correlated with AGEs level and with CRP level. RAGE, AGEs, and CRP concentrations were positively correlated with HbA1c levels and negatively correlated with MoCA score. The univariate logistic regression models revealed that variables, which increased the likelihood of diagnosis of MCI in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes were higher levels of HbA1c, RAGE, AGEs, CRP, TG, lower level of HDL cholesterol, previous CVD, HA, or use of HA drugs, hyperlipidemia, retinopathy, nephropathy, increased number of co-morbidities, older age, and less years of formal education. HA or use of HA drugs, previous CVD, higher level of RAGE and CRP, older age and less years of formal education are the factors increasing the likelihood of having MCI in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes in multivariable model.CONCLUSION: In summary, serum AGEs, RAGE, and CRP are increased in the circulation of MCI elderly diabetic patients compared to controls. A larger population-based prospective study needs to be performed to further confirm the relationship between AGEs, RAGE, and the cognitive decline or progress to dementia."
"26578946","Complex network analysis of resting state EEG in amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients with type 2 diabetes.","PURPOSE: Diabetes is a great risk factor for dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study investigates whether complex network-derived features in resting state EEG (rsEEG) could be applied as a biomarker to distinguish amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) from normal cognitive function in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D).METHOD: In this study, EEG was recorded in 28 patients with T2D (16 aMCI patients and 12 controls) during a no-task eyes-closed resting state. Pair-wise synchronization of rsEEG signals were assessed in six frequency bands (delta, theta, lower alpha, upper alpha, beta, and gamma) using phase lag index (PLI) and grouped into long distance (intra- and inter-hemispheric) and short distance interactions. PLI-weighted connectivity networks were also constructed, and characterized by mean clustering coefficient and path length. The correlation of these features and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores was assessed.RESULTS: Main findings of this study were as follows: (1) In comparison with controls, patients with aMCI had a significant decrease of global mean PLI in lower alpha, upper alpha, and beta bands. Lower functional connection at short and long intra-hemispheric distance mainly appeared on the left hemisphere. (2) In the lower alpha band, clustering coefficient was significantly lower in aMCI group, and the path length significantly increased. (3) Cognitive status measured by MoCA had a significant positive correlation with cluster coefficient and negative correlation with path length in lower alpha band.CONCLUSIONS: The brain network of aMCI patients displayed a disconnection syndrome and a loss of small-world architecture. The correlation between cognitive states and network characteristics suggested that the more in deterioration of the diabetes patients' cognitive state, the less optimal the network organization become. Hence, the complex network-derived biomarkers based on EEG could be employed to track cognitive function of diabetic patients and provide a new diagnosis tool for aMCI."
"26563847","The Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R) and its sub-scores: normative values in an Italian population sample.","The Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R) is a rapid screening battery, including five sub-scales to explore different cognitive domains: attention/orientation, memory, fluency, language and visuospatial. ACE-R is considered useful in discriminating cognitively normal subjects from patients with mild dementia. The aim of present study was to provide normative values for ACE-R total score and sub-scale scores in a large sample of Italian healthy subjects. Five hundred twenty-six Italian healthy subjects (282 women and 246 men) of different ages (age range 20-93 years) and educational level (from primary school to university) underwent ACE-R and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that age and education significantly influenced performance on ACE-R total score and sub-scale scores. A significant effect of gender was found only in sub-scale attention/orientation. From the derived linear equation, a correction grid for raw scores was built. Inferential cut-offs score were estimated using a non-parametric technique and equivalent scores (ES) were computed. Correlation analysis showed a good significant correlation between ACE-R adjusted scores with MoCA adjusted scores (r = 0.612, p &lt; 0.001). The present study provided normative data for the ACE-R in an Italian population useful for both clinical and research purposes."

"26523712","Detection and Differentiation of Frontotemporal Dementia and Related Disorders From Alzheimer Disease Using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a cognitive screening tool used by practitioners worldwide. The efficacy of the MoCA for screening frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and related disorders is unknown. The objectives were: (1) to determine whether the MoCA detects cognitive impairment (CI) in FTD subjects; (2) to determine whether Alzheimer disease (AD) and FTD subtypes and related disorders can be parsed using the MoCA; and (3) describe longitudinal MoCA performance by subtype. We extracted demographic and testing data from a database of patients referred to a cognitive neurology clinic who met criteria for probable AD or FTD (N=192). Logistic regression was used to determine whether dementia subtypes were associated with overall scores, subscores, or combinations of subscores on the MoCA. Initial MoCA results demonstrated CI in the majority of FTD subjects (87%). FTD subjects (N=94) performed better than AD subjects (N=98) on the MoCA (mean scores: 18.1 vs. 16.3; P=0.02). Subscores parsed many, but not all subtypes. FTD subjects had a larger decline on the MoCA within 13 to 36 months than AD subjects (P=0.02). The results indicate that the MoCA is a useful tool to identify and track progression of CI in FTD. Further, the data informs future research on scoring models for the MoCA to enhance cognitive screening and detection of FTD patients. "
"26519897","Which figure copy test is more sensitive for cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease: Wire cube or interlocking pentagons?","BACKGROUND: Performance on figure copy tests has been shown to predict progressive cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD). Historically, the interlocking pentagons from the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) have been the figure copy test most commonly used during cognitive screening evaluations. However, the wire cube from the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is increasingly being used.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate which of these figure copy tests is more sensitive for cognitive impairment in PD.METHODS: Sixty-three PD patients from UK and USA completed the MMSE and MoCA. Logistic regression and sensitivity/specificity analyses were used to evaluate the utility of each figure copy test for detecting global cognitive impairment.RESULTS: The wire cube was a significant indicator of cognitive impairment (OR=4.79, 95% CI=1.63-14.07, p=0.004), with a sensitivity/specificity of 0.74/0.63 in our sample. In contrast, interlocking pentagons were not a significant indicator of cognitive impairment (OR=1.88, 95% CI=0.54-6.50, p=0.32), with a sensitivity/specificity of 0.26/0.84.CONCLUSION: The wire cube is more sensitive to cognitive impairment in PD, most likely related to its greater complexity. The results have implications for clinicians who may have time for just one figure copying task as part of a brief screen for cognitive impairment in busy clinics and for researchers applying the PD mild cognitive impairment diagnostic criteria necessitating two tests of visuospatial function to be administered."

"26515085","The role of human kallikrein 6, clusterin and adiponectin as potential blood biomarkers of dementia.","OBJECTIVES: Progressive degenerative syndromes which affect brain, altering memory, behavior, cognition and emotion, are commonly defined as dementia. It was suggested that serum human kallikrein 6 (KLK6), clusterin (CLU) and adiponectin (ADPN) in combination with inflammation markers, neuroimaging and neuropsychological testing could assist in discriminating dementia patients from control individuals. Our aim was therefore to compare serum concentrations of KLK6, CLU and ADPN and inflammatory marker, interleukin-6 (IL-6), in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD), patients with vascular dementia (VAD), cognitively healthy participants (CHP) and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum samples were collected from AD, VAD and MCI patients admitted to the University Department of Neurology (Zagreb, Croatia) for regular follow-up. All patients underwent standard neuroimaging procedures including brain CT, neurosonological assessment with intima-media thickness (IMT) and breath holding index (BHI) calculations. Cognitive abilities were tested using standard Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Concentrations of KLK6, CLU, ADPN and IL-6 were determined in all serum samples.RESULTS: We have recruited a total of 235 participants, divided in 4 groups: AD (N=70), VAD (N=67), MCI (N=48) and CHP (N=50). Serum concentrations of KLK6 (P=0.137), CLU (P=0.178) and ADPN (P=0.268) did not differ between AD, VAD, MCI and cognitively healthy control group of participants, whereas IL-6 was significantly higher in VAD patients than in AD, MCI and CHP individuals (P=0.014). There was no association between investigated biomarkers and clinical patient parameters.CONCLUSIONS: Serum concentrations of KLK6, CLU and ADPN do not differ between AD, VAD and controls with and without mild cognitive impairment. Higher IL-6 levels in VAD group point to the inflammatory component in the development of vascular dementia. Investigated biomarkers are not associated with neuroimaging findings and neuropsychological patient data."
"26513331","Montreal Cognitive Assessment for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.","BACKGROUND: Dementia is a progressive syndrome of global cognitive impairment with significant health and social care costs. Global prevalence is projected to increase, particularly in resource-limited settings. Recent policy changes in Western countries to increase detection mandates a careful examination of the diagnostic accuracy of neuropsychological tests for dementia.OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at various thresholds for dementia and its subtypes.SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS Previews, Science Citation Index, PsycINFO and LILACS databases to August 2012. In addition, we searched specialised sources containing diagnostic studies and reviews, including MEDION (Meta-analyses van Diagnostisch Onderzoek), DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects), HTA (Health Technology Assessment Database), ARIF (Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility) and C-EBLM (International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine Committee for Evidence-based Laboratory Medicine) databases. We also searched ALOIS (Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group specialized register of diagnostic and intervention studies). We identified further relevant studies from the PubMed 'related articles' feature and by tracking key studies in Science Citation Index and Scopus. We also searched for relevant grey literature from the Web of Science Core Collection, including Science Citation Index and Conference Proceedings Citation Index (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), PhD theses and contacted researchers with potential relevant data.SELECTION CRITERIA: Cross-sectional designs where all participants were recruited from the same sample were sought; case-control studies were excluded due to high chance of bias. We searched for studies from memory clinics, hospital clinics, primary care and community populations. We excluded studies of early onset dementia, dementia from a secondary cause, or studies where participants were selected on the basis of a specific disease type such as Parkinson's disease or specific settings such as nursing homes.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted dementia study prevalence and dichotomised test positive/test negative results with thresholds used to diagnose dementia. This allowed calculation of sensitivity and specificity if not already reported in the study. Study authors were contacted where there was insufficient information to complete the 2x2 tables. We performed quality assessment according to the QUADAS-2 criteria.Methodological variation in selected studies precluded quantitative meta-analysis, therefore results from individual studies were presented with a narrative synthesis.MAIN RESULTS: Seven studies were selected: three in memory clinics, two in hospital clinics, none in primary care and two in population-derived samples. There were 9422 participants in total, but most of studies recruited only small samples, with only one having more than 350 participants. The prevalence of dementia was 22% to 54% in the clinic-based studies, and 5% to 10% in population samples. In the four studies that used the recommended threshold score of 26 or over indicating normal cognition, the MoCA had high sensitivity of 0.94 or more but low specificity of 0.60 or less.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The overall quality and quantity of information is insufficient to make recommendations on the clinical utility of MoCA for detecting dementia in different settings. Further studies that do not recruit participants based on diagnoses already present (case-control design) but apply diagnostic tests and reference standards prospectively are required. Methodological clarity could be improved in subsequent DTA studies of MoCA by reporting findings using recommended guidelines (e.g. STARDdem). Thresholds lower than 26 are likely to be more useful for optimal diagnostic accuracy of MoCA in dementia, but this requires confirmation in further studies."
"26503441","A correlativity study of plasma APL128 and clusterin levels with MMSE/MoCA/CASI in aMCI patients.","Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a sub-clinical condition characterized by memory deficits that are not severe enough to affect daily functioning. Here we investigated two potential biomarkers found in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients, APLP1-derived A-like peptides 28 (APL128) and clusterin plasma levels, in terms of their relationship to cognitive function, as reflected in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Cognitive Assessment Screening Instrument (CASI) in aMCI patients. Forty-seven aMCI patients and thirty-five age- and gender-matched healthy adult controls were recruited for this study. Using the ELISA method, we found that the mean concentrations of both APL128 and clusterin were not significantly different between the control and aMCI groups. The APL128 levels were positively correlated with clusterin and that both were negatively correlated with the MMSE scores of the aMCI patients. Clusterin levels were negatively correlated with the MoCA and CASI scores of the aMCI patients. Using multivariate analysis, the correlation between clusterin and MMSE/MoCA/CASI was independent of other AD risk factors including age, education, sex, body mass index and ApoE genotype. The data presented here demonstrate that plasma clusterin levels reflect cognitive function in aMCI patients. "

The Abbreviated MoCA (A-MoCA; range 0-22) was calculated from the full MoCA. Scores from the three tests were analyzed using equipercentile equating, a statistical method for determining comparable scores on different tests of a similar construct by estimating percentile equivalents.RESULTS: MoCA scores were lower (mean 19.3  5.8) than MMSE scored (mean 24.1  6.6). Traditional MMSE cut-points of 27 for mild cognitive impairment and 23 for dementia corresponded to MoCA scores of 23 and 17, respectively.CONCLUSION: Scores on the full and abbreviated versions of the MoCA can be linked directly to the MMSE. The MoCA may be more sensitive to changes in cognitive performance at higher levels of functioning."

We selected 32 genetic variants from 11 genes (CDC123, CDKAL1, CDKN2B, FTO, GLIS3, HHEX, IGF2BP2, KCNJ11, KCNQ1, SLC30A8, and TCF7L2) and intergenic regions based on results of recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in T2DM. These variants were reported to be T2DM-susceptibility loci and have been replicated in other independent studies. All association analyses were performed using logistic regression models, adjusting for age and sex.RESULTS: KCNQ1 SNP rs163182 showed the strongest association with AD, but it was not significant after Bonferroni correction (OR=1.30, 95% CI=1.07-1.59, Pcorrected=0.32). In PD patients, CDC123 SNP rs11257655 showed modest association with MMSE score &lt;26, and CDKN2B SNPs (rs2383208, rs10965250, and rs10811661) showed modest association with MoCA score &lt;26, which were not significant after Bonferroni correction. Other genetic variants had no association with the risk of PD or AD and the severity of cognitive impairment.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that genome-wide significant loci of T2DM play no major role in the risk and cognitive impairment of PD and AD."
"26489991","The reliability and validity of the informant AD8 by comparison with a series of cognitive assessment tools in primary healthcare.","BACKGROUND: The validity and reliability of the informant AD8 in primary healthcare has not been established. Therefore, the present study examined the validity and reliability of the informant AD8 in government subsidized primary healthcare centers in Singapore.METHODS: Eligible patients (=60 years old) were recruited from primary healthcare centers and their informants received the AD8. Patient-informant dyads who agreed for further cognitive assessments received the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and a locally validated formal neuropsychological battery at a research center in a tertiary hospital.RESULTS: 1,082 informants completed AD8 assessment at two primary healthcare centers. Of these, 309 patients-informant dyads were further assessed, of whom 243 (78.6%) were CDR = 0; 22 (7.1%) were CDR = 0.5; and 44 (14.2%) were CDR=1. The mean administration time of the informant AD8 was 2.3  1.0 minutes. The informant AD8 demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's a = 0.85); inter-rater reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) = 0.85); and test-retest reliability (weighted <U+03BA> = 0.80). Concurrent validity, as measured by the correlation between total AD8 scores and CDR global (R = 0.65, p &lt; 0.001), CDR sum of boxes (R = 0.60, p &lt; 0.001), MMSE (R = -0.39, p &lt; 0.001), MoCA (R = -0.41, p &lt; 0.001), as well as the formal neuropsychological battery (R = -0.46, p &lt; 0.001), was good and consistent with previous studies. Construct validity, as measured by convergent validity (R = 0.4) between individual items of AD8 with CDR and neuropsychological domains was acceptable.CONCLUSIONS: The informant AD8 demonstrated good concurrent and construct validity and is a reliable measure to detect cognitive dysfunction in primary healthcare."
"26484925","Sensitivity of Neuropsychological Tests to Identify Cognitive Decline in Highly Educated Elderly Individuals: 12 Months Follow up.","Highly educated individuals have a lower risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). A common assumption is that their &quot;cognitive reserve&quot; protects them from cognitive decline and postpones the clinical manifestation of dementia. These highly educated individuals usually obtain normal scores on cognitive screening tests, although at the same time they can experience subjective cognitive decline and difficulty in multiple cognitive domains. Although comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations usually identify subtle changes in cognition, they demand extensive resources and thus are expensive and difficult to obtain. Therefore, lack of sensitivity of screening tests on the one hand, along with difficulty to acquire a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation on the other hand, impede identification of cognitive decline at its earliest stages in this special population. Accordingly, this study aims to identify which neuropsychological tests have the highest sensitivity to detect the earliest stages of cognitive decline among highly educated elderly [n<U+200A>=<U+200A>27, ages 66-80 (mean<U+200A>=<U+200A>72.6 SD<U+200A>=<U+200A>4.54), mean education level<U+200A>=<U+200A>17.14 (SD<U+200A>=<U+200A>3.21 range: 12-24 years)]. Baseline scores and scores at one-year follow up were obtained. We also conducted MRI scans to characterize the relation between brain volume and cognitive performance. Results show significant reductions in RVALT, Semantic verbal Fluency, ROCF copy, and MoCA scores whereas PF, TMT, ROCF delay, digit span, and knowledge tests were not significant. The study stresses the importance of using sensitive neuropsychological tests to examine this special population and the need to create norms that combine an individual's education with age. "
"26470772","Montreal Cognitive Assessment: One Cutoff Never Fits All.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to examine the discrepancy between single versus age and education corrected cutoff scores in classifying performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack.METHODS: MoCA norms were collected from 794 functionally independent and stroke- and dementia-free persons aged =65 years. magnetic resonance imaging was used to exclude healthy controls with significant brain pathology and medial temporal lobe atrophy. Cutoff scores at 16th, 7th, and 2nd percentiles by age and education were derived for the MoCA and MoCA 5-minute Protocol. MoCA performance in 919 patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack was classified using the single and norm-derived cutoff scores.RESULTS: The norms for the Hong Kong version of the MoCA total and domain scores and the total score of the MoCA 5-minute protocol are described. Only 65.1% and 25.7% healthy controls and 45.2% and 19.0% patients scored above the conventional cutoff scores of 21/22 and 25/26 on the MoCA. Using classification with norm-derived cutoff scores as reference, locally derived cutoff score of 21/22 yielded a classification discrepancy of =42.4%. Discrepancy increased with higher age and lower education level, with the majority being false positives by single cutoffs. With the 25/26 cutoff of the original MoCA, discrepancy further increased to =74.3%.CONCLUSIONS: Conventional single cutoff scores are associated with substantially high rates of misclassification especially in older and less-educated patients with stroke. These results caution against the use of one-size-fits-all cutoffs on the MoCA."
"26464420","Routine cognitive screening in older patients admitted to acute medicine: abbreviated mental test score (AMTS) and subjective memory complaint versus Montreal Cognitive Assessment and IQCODE.","INTRODUCTION: Routine cognitive screening for in-patients aged =75 years is recommended, but there is uncertainty around how this should be operationalised. We therefore determined the feasibility and reliability of the Abbreviated mental test score (AMTS/10) and its relationship to subjective memory complaint, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA/30) and informant report in unselected older admissions.METHODS: Consecutive acute general medicine patients aged =75 years admitted over 10 weeks (March-May 2013) had AMTS and a question regarding subjective memory complaint (if no known dementia/delirium). At =72 h, the 30-point Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) were done. Cognitive impairment was defined as AMTS &lt; 9 or MoCA &lt; 26 (mild impairment) and MoCA &lt; 20 (moderate/severe impairment) or IQCODE = 3.6.RESULTS: Among 264 patients (mean age/SD = 84.3/5.6 years, 117 (44%) male), 228 (86%) were testable with AMTS. 49/50 (98%) testable patients with dementia/delirium had low AMTS compared with 79/199 (44%) of those without (P &lt; 0.001). Subjective memory complaint agreed poorly with objective cognitive deficit (39% denying a memory problem had AMTS &lt; 9 (kappa = 0.134, P = 0.086)) as did informant report (kappa = 0.18, P = 0.15). In contrast, correlation between AMTS and MoCA was strong (R2 = 0.59, P &lt; 0.001) with good agreement between AMTS &lt; 9 and MoCA &lt; 20 (kappa = 0.50, P &lt; 0.01), although 85% of patients with normal AMTS had MoCA &lt; 26.CONCLUSIONS: The AMTS was feasible and valid in older acute medicine patients agreeing well with the MoCA albeit with a ceiling effect. Objective cognitive deficits were prevalent in patients without known dementia or delirium but were not reliably identified by subjective cognitive complaint or informant report."
"26459220","Exploring the effects of coexisting amyloid in subcortical vascular cognitive impairment.","BACKGROUND: Mixed pathology, particularly Alzheimer's disease with cerebrovascular lesions, is reported as the second most common cause of dementia. Research on mixed dementia typically includes people with a primary AD diagnosis and hence, little is known about the effects of co-existing amyloid pathology in people with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). The purpose of this study was to understand whether individual differences in amyloid pathology might explain variations in cognitive impairment among individuals with clinical subcortical VCI (SVCI).METHODS: Twenty-two participants with SVCI completed an (11)C Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) position emission tomography (PET) scan to quantify global amyloid deposition. Cognitive function was measured using: 1) MOCA; 2) ADAS-Cog; 3) EXIT-25; and 4) specific executive processes including a) Digits Forward and Backwards Test, b) Stroop-Colour Word Test, and c) Trail Making Test. To assess the effect of amyloid deposition on cognitive function we conducted Pearson bivariate correlations to determine which cognitive measures to include in our regression models. Cognitive variables that were significantly correlated with PIB retention values were entered in a hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis to determine the unique effect of amyloid on cognitive function. We controlled for age, education, and ApoE e4 status.RESULTS: Bivariate correlation results showed that PIB binding was significantly correlated with ADAS-Cog (p &lt; 0.01) and MOCA (p &lt; 0.01); increased PIB binding was associated with worse cognitive function on both cognitive measures. PIB binding was not significantly correlated with the EXIT-25 or with specific executive processes (p &gt; 0.05). Regression analyses controlling for age, education, and ApoE e4 status indicated an independent association between PIB retention and the ADAS-Cog (adjusted R-square change of 15.0%, Sig F Change = 0.03). PIB retention was also independently associated with MOCA scores (adjusted R-Square Change of 27.0%, Sig F Change = 0.02).CONCLUSION: We found that increased global amyloid deposition was significantly associated with greater memory and executive dysfunctions as measured by the ADAS-Cog and MOCA. Our findings point to the important role of co-existing amyloid deposition for cognitive function in those with a primary SVCI diagnosis. As such, therapeutic approaches targeting SVCI must consider the potential role of amyloid for the optimal care of those with mixed dementia.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01027858."
"26450414","Cognitive assessment tools in Asia: a systematic review.","BACKGROUND: The prevalence of dementia is increasing in Asia than in any other continent. However, the applicability of the existing cognitive assessment tools is limited by differences in educational and cultural factors in this setting. We conducted a systematic review of published studies on cognitive assessments tools in Asia. We aimed to rationalize the results of available studies which evaluated the validity of cognitive tools for the detection of cognitive impairment and to identify the issues surrounding the available cognitive impairment screening tools in Asia.METHODS: Five electronic databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Science Direct) were searched using the keywords dementia Or Alzheimer Or cognitive impairment And screen Or measure Or test Or tool Or instrument Or assessment, and 2,381 articles were obtained.RESULTS: Thirty-eight articles, evaluating 28 tools in seven Asian languages, were included. Twenty-nine (76%) of the studies had been conducted in East Asia with only four studies conducted in South Asia and no study from northern, western, or central Asia or Indochina. Local language translations of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were assessed in 15 and six studies respectively. Only three tools (the Korean Dementia Screening Questionnaire, the Picture-based Memory Intelligence Scale, and the revised Hasegawa Dementia Screen) were derived de novo from Asian populations. These tools were assessed in five studies. Highly variable cut-offs were reported for the MMSE (17-29/30) and MoCA (21-26/30), with 13/19 (68%) of studies reporting educational bias.CONCLUSIONS: Few cognitive assessment tools have been validated in Asia, with no published validation studies for many Asian nations and languages. In addition, many available tools display educational bias. Future research should include concerted efforts to develop culturally appropriate tools with minimal educational bias."
"26444776","Clinical utility of the informant AD8 as a dementia case finding instrument in primary healthcare.","The informant AD8 has excellent discriminant ability for dementia case finding in tertiary healthcare settings. However, its clinical utility for dementia case finding at the forefront of dementia management, primary healthcare, is unknown. Therefore, we recruited participants from two primary healthcare centers in Singapore and measured their performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and a local formal neuropsychological battery, in addition to the AD8. Logistic regression was conducted to examine the associations between demographic factors and dementia. Area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was used to establish the optimal cut-off points for dementia case finding. Of the 309 participants recruited, 243 (78.7%) had CDR<U+200A>=<U+200A>0, 22 (7.1%) CDR<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.5, and 44 (14.2%) CDR =1. Age was strongly associated with dementia, and the optimal age for dementia case finding in primary healthcare settings was =75 years. In this age group, the AD8 has excellent dementia case finding capability and was superior to the MMSE and equivalent to the MoCA [AD8 AUC (95% CI): 0.95 (0.91-0.99), cut-off: =3, sensitivity: 0.90, specificity: 0.88, PPV: 0.79 and NPV: 0.94; MMSE AUC (95% CI): 0.87 (0.79-0.94), p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.04; MoCA AUC (95% CI): 0.88 (0.82-0.95), p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.06]. In conclusion, the AD8 is well suited for dementia case finding in primary healthcare settings. "
"26346644","Relationship between the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Mini-mental State Examination for assessment of mild cognitive impairment in older adults.","BACKGROUND: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was developed to enable earlier detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) relative to familiar multi-domain tests like the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE). Clinicians need to better understand the relationship between MoCA and MMSE scores.METHODS: For this cross-sectional study, we analyzed 219 healthy control (HC), 299 MCI, and 100 Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia cases from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-GO/2 database to evaluate MMSE and MoCA score distributions and select MoCA values to capture early and late MCI cases. Stepwise variable selection in logistic regression evaluated relative value of four test domains for separating MCI from HC. Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) was evaluated as a strategy to separate dementia from MCI. Equi-percentile equating produced a translation grid for MoCA against MMSE scores. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses evaluated lower cutoff scores for capturing the most MCI cases.RESULTS: Most dementia cases scored abnormally, while MCI and HC score distributions overlapped on each test. Most MCI cases scored = 17 on MoCA (96.3%) and = 24 on MMSE (98.3%). The ceiling effect (28-30 points) for MCI and HC was less using MoCA (18.1%) versus MMSE (71.4%). MoCA and MMSE scores correlated most for dementia (r = 0.86; versus MCI r = 0.60; HC r = 0.43). Equi-percentile equating showed a MoCA score of 18 was equivalent to MMSE of 24. ROC analysis found MoCA = 17 as the cutoff between MCI and dementia that emphasized high sensitivity (92.3%) to capture MCI cases. The core and orientation domains in both tests best distinguished HC from MCI groups, whereas comprehension/executive function and attention/calculation were not helpful. Mean FAQ scores were significantly higher and a greater proportion had abnormal FAQ scores in dementia than MCI and HC.CONCLUSIONS: MoCA and MMSE were more similar for dementia cases, but MoCA distributes MCI cases across a broader score range with less ceiling effect. A cutoff of = 17 on the MoCA may help capture early and late MCI cases; depending on the level of sensitivity desired, = 18 or 19 could be used. Functional assessment can help exclude dementia cases. MoCA scores are translatable to the MMSE to facilitate comparison."
"26338988","Resilience and MRI correlates of cognitive impairment in community-dwelling elders.","BACKGROUND: The contribution of education and intelligence to resilience against age-related cognitive decline is not clear, particularly in the presence of 'normal for age' minor brain abnormalities.METHOD: Participants (n = 208, mean age 69.2 years, s.d. = 5.4) in the Whitehall II imaging substudy attended for neuropsychological testing and multisequence 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging. Images were independently rated by three trained clinicians for global and hippocampal atrophy, periventricular and deep white matter changes.RESULTS: Although none of the participants qualified for a clinical diagnosis of dementia, a screen for cognitive impairment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) &lt;26) was abnormal in 22%. Hippocampal atrophy, in contrast to other brain measures, was associated with a reduced MoCA score even after controlling for age, gender, socioeconomic status, years of education and premorbid IQ. Premorbid IQ and socioeconomic status were associated with resilience in the presence of hippocampal atrophy.CONCLUSIONS: Independent contributions from a priori risk (age, hippocampal atrophy) and resilience (premorbid function, socioeconomic status) combine to predict measured cognitive impairment."
"26297124","Combined therapy of Di-Huang-Yi-Zhi with Donepezil in patients with Parkinson's disease dementia.","Here we conducted a randomized and double-blind study attempting to explore the safety and efficacy of combined therapy of Di-Huang-Yi-Zhi (DHYZ) with donepezil in treating Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). Sixty PDD patients were included and randomly divided into control group and DHYZ group. All patients were given donepezil (5 mg last for a month, then 10 mg for the rest months, once daily), while patients in DHYZ group were additionally administrated with DHYZ (150 ml, twice daily). The measurement subjects included mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), the Barthel Index for activities of daily living (ADL) and Traditional Chinese medical (TCM) symptoms before and after treatment in this study. The whole study lasted for six months. Significant differences were observed on MMSE, MoCA, ADAS-Cog, ADL and TCM in both control and DHYZ group (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01) before and after drug treatment. Furthermore, there were more obvious changes of MMSE, MoCA, ADAS-Cog, ADL and TCM scores compared the DHYZ group with the control group (P&lt;0.01) which suggested the DHYZ group showed a more effective improvement on cognition, behavior as well global function. In conclusion, the combined therapy of DHYZ with donepezil showed a more effective improvement in PDD and the underlying mechanism may be related to the synergic amelioration of cholinergic system between them."
"26296077","GBA Variants are associated with a distinct pattern of cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease.","BACKGROUND: Loss-of-function mutations in the GBA gene are associated with more severe cognitive impairment in PD, but the nature of these deficits is not well understood and whether common GBA polymorphisms influence cognitive performance in PD is not yet known.METHODS: We screened the GBA coding region for mutations and the E326K polymorphism in 1,369 PD patients enrolled at eight sites from the PD Cognitive Genetics Consortium. Participants underwent assessments of learning and memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised), working memory/executive function (Letter-Number Sequencing Test and Trail Making Test A and B), language processing (semantic and phonemic verbal fluency), visuospatial abilities (Benton Judgment of Line Orientation), and global cognitive function (MoCA). We used linear regression to test for association between genotype and cognitive performance with adjustment for important covariates and accounted for multiple testing using Bonferroni's corrections.RESULTS: Mutation carriers (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>60; 4.4%) and E326K carriers (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>65; 4.7%) had a higher prevalence of dementia (mutations, odds ratio<U+2009>=<U+2009>5.1; P<U+2009>=<U+2009>9.7<U+2009><U+2009>10(-6) ; E326K, odds ratio<U+2009>=<U+2009>6.4; P<U+2009>=<U+2009>5.7<U+2009><U+2009>10(-7) ) and lower performance on Letter-Number Sequencing (mutations, corrected P[Pc ]<U+2009>=<U+2009>9.0<U+2009><U+2009>10(-4) ; E326K, Pc <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.036), Trail Making B-A (mutations, Pc <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.018; E326K, Pc <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.018), and Benton Judgment of Line Orientation (mutations, Pc <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0045; E326K, Pc <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0013).CONCLUSIONS: Both GBA mutations and E326K are associated with a distinct cognitive profile characterized by greater impairment in working memory/executive function and visuospatial abilities in PD patients. The discovery that E326K negatively impacts cognitive performance approximately doubles the proportion of PD patients we now recognize are at risk for more severe GBA-related cognitive deficits."
"26288230","Impact of Rivastigmine on Cognitive Dysfunction and Falling in Parkinson's Disease Patients.","BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to observe the incidence of falls in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with different cognitive levels and to investigate the effect of the cholinesterase inhibitor Rivastigmine on cognitive dysfunction and falling in PD patients.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Data from 176 PD patients participating in the collaborative PD study between June 2010 and June 2014 were collected; the Chinese edition of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score was used to evaluate the cognitive function of patients, and falls were recorded. PD patients with cognitive dysfunction were randomly administered either a placebo or Rivastigmine. The cognitive function changes and difference in fall incidence were compared between the 2 groups.RESULTS: The average number of falls per person in PD patients without cognitive impairment dysfunction was significantly lower than that in patients in the PD mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) group and that in the PD dementia (PDD) group (p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.001, respectively), and the incidence of falls was significantly lower than that in patients in the PD-MCI and PDD groups (p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.01, respectively). Compared to the PD-MCI group, the incidence of falls of patients in the PDD group (OR 2.45, 95% CI 0.97-6.20, p &lt; 0.01) and the number of falls per person were significantly increased (p &lt; 0.01). After taking the placebo or Rivastigmine for 12 months, the MoCA scores of patients in the Rivastigmine treatment group were significantly higher than those of the control group (p = 0.002). The number of falls per person and the incidence of falls of patients in Rivastigmine treatment group were significantly lower than those in the placebo group (p &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the degree of cognitive impairment is closely associated with the incidence of falls, and the cholinesterase inhibitor Rivastigmine can delay the deterioration of cognitive function and lower the incidence of falls in PD patients."

However, information about potentials for low-cost and low-risk interventions is limited.OBJECTIVES: to study the associations between lifestyle activities and global cognition from the Cognitive and Lifestyle Activity Study for Seniors in Asia (CLASSA).DESIGN: a cross-sectional study.METHODOLOGY: we studied the association between global cognition and lifestyle activity participation in community living older adults (60 years or over) across nine sites in East Asia. A standardised lifestyle activity questionnaire exploring activities from four categories (intellectual, physical, social and recreational) was used to measure the pattern. Global cognition was categorised by locally validated versions of Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (good cognition, GC-scored at the top 25% among participants with no significant cognitive deficit (SCD); normal cognition, NC-middle 50% among participants with no SCD; mild cognitive deficit, MCD-lowest 25% among participants with no SCD; SCD-below local cut-offs for dementia).RESULTS: two thousand four hundred and four (1,009 men; 1,395 women) participants were recruited. The mean age was 71.0 (7.2) years. A higher variety of intellectual and physical activities were associated with GC; more social activities were associated with higher risks of having impaired cognition (multinomial logistic regression). The same association was found in participants with no SCD and had regular activities for over 10 years (n = 574).CONCLUSION: intellectual activity and physical exercise were associated with better cognitive states in Asian older adults. Community-based intervention may take considerations into specific types of activities to optimise cognition."

"26218598","Cardiovascular Risk Factors Associated with Smaller Brain Volumes in Regions Identified as Early Predictors of Cognitive Decline.","PURPOSE: To determine in a large multiethnic cohort the cardiovascular and genetic risk factors associated with smaller volume in the hippocampus, precuneus, and posterior cingulate, and their association with preclinical deficits in cognitive performance in patients younger and older than 50 years.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved the study and all participants provided written informed consent. Eligible for this study were 1629 participants (700 men and 929 women; mean age, 50.0 years  10.2 [standard deviation]) drawn from the population-based Dallas Heart Study who underwent laboratory and clinical analysis in an initial baseline visit and approximately 7 years later underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging with automated volumetry and cognitive assessment with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Regression analysis showed associations between risk factors and segmental volumes, and associations between these volumes with cognitive performance in participants younger and older than 50 years.RESULTS: Lower hippocampal volume was associated with previous alcohol consumption (standardized estimate, -0.04; P = .039) and smoking (standardized estimate, -0.04; P = .048). Several risk factors correlated with lower total brain, posterior cingulate, and precuneus volumes. Higher total (standardized estimate, 0.06; P = .050), high-density lipoprotein (standardized estimate, 0.07; P = .003), and low-density lipoprotein (standardized estimate, 0.04; P = .037) cholesterol levels were associated with larger posterior cingulate volume, and higher triglyceride levels (standardized estimate, 0.06; P = .004) were associated with larger precuneus volume. Total MoCA score was associated with posterior cingulate volume (standardized estimate, 0.13; P = .001) in younger individuals and with hippocampal (standardized estimate, 0.06; P &lt; .05) and precuneus (standardized estimate, 0.08; P &lt; .023) volumes in older adults.CONCLUSION: Smaller volumes in specific brain regions considered to be early markers of dementia risk were associated with specific cardiovascular disease risk factors and cognitive deficits in a predominantly midlife multiethnic population-based sample. Additionally, the risk factors most associated with these brain volumes differed in participants younger and older than 50 years, as did the association between brain volume and MoCA score."
"26177715","Use of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Alzheimer's Disease-8 as cognitive screening measures in Parkinson's disease.","OBJECTIVE: To examine the sensitivity and specificity of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a brief cognitive screening measure previously validated for use in Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's Disease-8 (AD8), an eight-item informant report used to screen for dementia, but not yet validated for use in PD, to identify cognitive impairment in a sample of 111 patients with PD.METHODS: Cognitive impairment was determined based on a battery of neuropsychological measures, excluding the MoCA and AD8. Classification rates of both the MoCA and AD8 in identifying cognitive impairment were examined using logistic regression and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. Optimal cutoff scores were determined to maximize sensitivity and specificity.RESULTS: The MoCA correctly classified 78.4% of participants (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001), and ROC analysis yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.82. A MoCA cutoff score of &lt;25 yielded optimal sensitivity (0.77) and specificity (0.79) for identifying PD patients with cognitive impairment. Similar analyses for the AD8 were statistically nonsignificant, although the classification rate was 70.5%, with an AUC of 0.50.CONCLUSIONS: These results provide additional support for the MoCA, but not the AD8, in identifying cognitive impairment in patients with PD."
"26161001","Normal Hearing Ability but Impaired Auditory Selective Attention Associated with Prediction of Response to Donepezil in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.","BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients have a poor response to the voices of caregivers. After administration of donepezil, caregivers often find that patients respond more frequently, whereas they had previously pretended to be &quot;deaf.&quot; We investigated whether auditory selective attention is associated with response to donepezil.METHODS: The subjects were40 AD patients, 20 elderly healthy controls (HCs), and 15 young HCs. Pure tone audiometry was conducted and an original Auditory Selective Attention (ASA) test was performed with a MoCA vigilance test. Reassessment of the AD group was performed after donepezil treatment for 3 months.RESULTS: Hearing level of the AD group was the same as that of the elderly HC group. However, ASA test scores decreased in the AD group and were correlated with the vigilance test scores. Donepezil responders (MMSE 3+) also showed improvement on the ASA test. At baseline, the responders had higher vigilance and lower ASA test scores.CONCLUSION: Contrary to the common view, AD patients had a similar level of hearing ability to healthy elderly.

"26132488","Relationship between dual task walking, cognition, and depression in oldest old people.","BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to investigate the relationship between dual task walking, cognition, and depression in oldest old people living in the community.METHODS: We conducted an observational cross-sectional study at Federal University of So Carlos (Brazil). We assessed 67 community-dwelling older adults aged 80 years and over, who were able to walk alone and did not present with a risk of dementia (assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE). The assessment consisted of anamnesis, dual task using the Timed Up and Go test associated with a motor task (TUGT-motor) and a cognitive task (TUGT-cognitive); cognitive measures using MMSE, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Clock Drawing test (CDT) and verbal fluency, and depressive measures by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).RESULTS: There was a correlation with higher magnitude between cognitive tests and TUGT-cognitive, compared to TUGT-motor. For TUGT-motor, the highest correlations with cognitive tests were found between time and MMSE, MoCA (total score), and MoCA visuospatial/executive domain. For TUGT-cognitive, the highest correlations with cognitive tests were between number of steps and MMSE and between time and MMSE. GDS showed a significant weak correlation with number of steps taken in TUGT-motor, wrong words, and correct/time of TUGT-cognitive.CONCLUSIONS: Dual task performances are associated with cognition in oldest old. Furthermore, dual task tests have less influence of educational level, are functional, fast, and easily applicable in clinical practice. Future studies are needed to confirm if dual task test is useful for cognitive screening in oldest old."
"26113397","Usability and Validity of a Battery of Computerised Cognitive Screening Tests for Detecting Cognitive Impairment.","BACKGROUND: Computerised cognitive screening (CCS) has the potential to detect cognitive impairment in the community, which is important for the early diagnosis of dementia.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of older adults with dementia to engage with smart phone and tablet technologies and to determine the accuracy of a battery of CCS tasks to detect cognitive impairment in comparison with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).METHODS: Patients with mild-moderate dementia (n = 40) attending a university-linked day hospital and normal controls (n = 20) completed (i) a questionnaire detailing the frequency and breadth of their technology use, (ii) three commercially available CCS tasks, and (iii) the MoCA.RESULTS: The three CCS tasks were completed by 85% (n = 34) of the patients with dementia and all controls; only 4 reported the task as 'hard'. Those with dementia scored significantly lower on the CCS than controls (p &lt; 0.001). CCS scores correlated with total MoCA scores (r = 0.78, p &lt; 0.01). Further, the CCS scores significantly predicted MoCA scores, controlling for the effects of age, gender, educational attainment, and frequency of technology use ( = 0.71, p &lt; 0.001), explaining 65.2% of the variance. Total CCS and MoCA scores (cut-off score &lt;24) had similar sensitivity (94 and 95%, respectively) and accuracy (area under the curve 0.94 and 0.99, respectively, p = 0.5) in discriminating dementia from controls, though the CSS had lower specificity (60 vs. 100% for the MoCA).CONCLUSION: The participants had little difficulty self-administering the CCS, which is an oft-cited barrier to computerised testing in this population. Our results support the criterion and construct validity of a CCS versus the commonly used MoCA. Although further research is required, CCS for cognitive impairment may be useful in the community and, by prompting referral to specialist services, could lead to an earlier diagnosis of dementia."

A group of 170 women was recruited to the study. The inclusion criteria were: minimum of two years after the last menstruation, FSH concentration 30 U/ml and no signs of dementia on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). A computerized battery of Central Nervous System Vital Signs (CNS VS) was used for diagnostic cognitive functions. APOE genotype was performed by multiplex PCR. In blood plasma were determined: triglycerides, total cholesterol and its fractions: HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way analysis of variance in STATISTICA software. In the postmenopausal women examined, the carrier state of APOE gene polymorphism was associated with the level of triglycerides, and results concerning three cognitive functions: executive functions, psychomotor speed, and cognitive flexibility. Loss of body weight in postmenopausal women was related with lower results in neurocognitive index and the majority of cognitive functions. The results concerning cognitive functions in postmenopausal women in the study were not significantly related with lipid profile. Significant differences were observed according to APOE gene polymorphism in correlations between LDL/HDL and CHOL/HDL ratios, and results in the processing speed and reaction time, as well as between the BMI and results in processing speed in the postmenopausal women examined.

"26082148","Global cognitive performance and frailty in non-demented community-dwelling older adults: Findings from the Sasaguri Genkimon Study.","AIM: To investigate the associations of global cognitive performance with frailty and pre-frailty in non-demented community-dwelling older adults.METHOD: A cross-sectional study was carried out using data from the baseline survey of the Sasaguri Genkimon Study in 2011. The study sample consisted of 1565 older adults with complete data and no evidence of dementia. Global cognitive performance was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Frailty state was defined using the Cardiovascular Health Study criteria, based on five components: unintentional weight loss, low grip strength, exhaustion, low gait speed and low physical activity.RESULTS: Total MoCA and MMSE scores, and their domain-specific scores decreased across the non-frail, pre-frail and frail groups. Poorer total MoCA and MMSE scores, as well as their domain-specific scores, were associated with the greater likelihood of being frail, but not with pre-frailty after full adjustment. The strength of the association with frailty was greater for total MoCA score than for total MMSE score. Domain-specific scores for visuospatial abilities and attention domains in both of the MoCA and MMSE were consistently associated with the likelihood of pre-frailty and frailty, even after being mutually adjusted for all domains.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA performance is more strongly associated with the odds of frailty than the MMSE performance in the relatively functional and non-demented older adult population. The present findings could contribute to further exploration of possible common pathways that can be targeted in the prevention and management for both of these two conditions.

"26078489","Screening Mild and Major Neurocognitive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease.","INTRODUCTION: Among the nonmotor features of Parkinson's disease (PD), cognitive impairment is one of the most troublesome problems. New diagnostic criteria for mild and major neurocognitive disorder (NCD) in PD were established by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition (DSM-5). The aim of our study was to establish the diagnostic accuracy of widely used screening tests for NCD in PD.METHODS: Within the scope of our study we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of different neuropsychological tests (Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE), Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)) in 370<U+2009>PD patients without depression.RESULTS: MoCA and ACE feature the finest diagnostic accuracy for detecting mild cognitive disorder in PD (DSM-5) at the cut-off scores of 23.5 and 83.5 points, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of these tests was 0.859 (95% CI: 0.818-0.894, MoCA) and 0.820 (95% CI: 0.774-0.859, ACE). In the detection of major NCD (DSM-5), MoCA and MDRS tests exhibited the best diagnostic accuracy at the cut-off scores of 20.5 and 132.5 points, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of these tests was 0.863 (95% CI: 0.823-0.897, MoCA) and 0.830 (95% CI: 0.785-0.869, MDRS).CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that the MoCA may be the most suitable test for detecting mild and major NCD in PD."
"26062587","[Diabetes and Dementia].","An aging global population is driving the current epidemic of dementia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetes is a known risk factor for the development of vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and mild cognitive impairment. Good control of diabetes may improve cognitive decline and prevent Alzheimer's disease. Mild cognitive impairment with type 2 diabetes (DM-MCI) often presents as a decline in attention, psychomotor speed, executive function, and memory. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is one of the best screening tools for detecting DM-MCI. We found that 72% of the patients admitted to educational hospitalization for type 2 diabetes could also be categorized into groups with frontal lobe dysfunction, delayed recall, and a mixed-type group. Anti-diabetic drugs and insulin may protect and improve cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and DM-MCI, but more studies are needed to verify this claim. Diabetes mellitus may be linked not only to Alzheimer's disease but also to other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's, Huntington's and frontotemporal lobe dementia. "
"26042394","Functional status of thyroid and cognitive functions after menopause.","BACKGROUND: Thyroid activity plays a role in cognition. However, the relation between the functional state of thyroid and neuropsychiatric changes proceeding with age among people without clinical symptoms of thyroid dysfunction is still unknown. The aim of this study was analysis of cognitive function levels in reference to thyroid examination: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), total thyroxin (TT4), triiodothyronine (TT3), free thyroxin (FT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPO-AB), and thyroglobulin antibodies (Tg-AB), TSH receptor antibodies (AB-TSHR) in women after menopause.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A group of 383 women was recruited for the study. The inclusion criteria were: minimum two years after the last menstruation and no dementia signs on Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Computerized battery of Central Nervous System Vital Signs (CNS VS) test was used to diagnostic cognitive functions. The blood plasma values were determined: TSH, FT3, FT4, TT3, TT4, TPO-AB, Tg-AB, and AB-TSHR. Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson's correlation coefficient and analysis of variance in STATISTICA software.RESULTS: In women after menopause, TSH was negatively correlated with NCI results, executive functions, complex attention, and cognitive flexibility. FT4 was positively correlated with results of psychomotor speed. TT3 and TT4 were negatively correlated with results of memory and verbal memory. Furthermore, TT4 was negatively correlated with NCI, executive functions, and cognitive flexibility. TPO-AB was negatively correlated with results of memory, verbal memory, and psychomotor speed. Tg-AB was positively correlated with results of reaction time. AB-TSHR was negatively correlated with NCI results, memory, executive functions, psychomotor speed, complex attention, and cognitive flexibility.CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the importance of thyroid functionality in cognitive functioning in a group of women after menopause. The values of TSH, TT3, TT4, TPO-AB, and AB-TSHR were higher and FT4 was lower in examined women. The results were poorer in examination of cognitive functions measured with a battery of CNS-VS tests."

"25978540","An Abbreviated Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) for Dementia Screening.","OBJECTIVE: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a cognitive screening instrument growing in popularity, but few studies have conducted psychometric item analyses or attempted to develop abbreviated forms. We sought to derive and validate a short-form MoCA (SF-MoCA) and compare its classification accuracy to the standard MoCA and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer disease (AD), and normal aging.METHODS: 408 subjects (MCI n=169, AD n=87, and normal n=152) were randomly divided into derivation and validation samples. Item analysis in the derivation sample identified most sensitive MoCA items. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses were used to develop cut-off scores and evaluate the classification accuracy of the SF-MoCA, standard MoCA, and MMSE. Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI) analyses and comparison of ROC curves were used to compare classification accuracy of the three measures.RESULTS: Serial subtraction (Cramer's V=.408), delayed recall (Cramer's V=.702), and orientation items (Cramer's V=.832) were included in the SF-MoCA based on largest effect sizes in item analyses. Results revealed 72.6% classification accuracy of the SF-MoCA, compared with 71.9% for the standard MoCA and 67.4% for the MMSE. Results of NRI analyses and ROC curve comparisons revealed that classification accuracy of the SF-MoCA was comparable to the standard version and generally superior to the MMSE.CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest the SF-MoCA could be an effective brief tool in detecting cognitive impairment."

The between-group difference in posterior cingulate (PCC) functional connectivity (FC) was performed to assess FC dysfunction. Atlas-based spatial statistics of DTI was applied to compare White matter (WM) fibers impairment between groups.RESULTS: (1) Functional connectivity: (1) PD-Cu compared with HC showed a decreased PCC functional connectivity of the right medial temporal lobe (MTL). In addition, PCC-right MTL connectivity strength of PD was significantly correlated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score. (2) PDD group shows a decreased FC of PCC-right parahippocampa compared with PD-Cu group; while show a widespread decreased PCC FC compared with HC group. (2) Anatomical connectivity: (1) Relative to PD-Cu, significant lower FA values were found in the left hippocampus in PDD. (2) PDD showed higher MD values in a widespread WM regions compared with PD-Cu and HC. (3) Positive correlation was observed between MoCA score and FA value of left inferior longitudinal and hippocampus, and bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus in PD.CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive decline in PD is associated with FC damage of PCC-right MTL and microstructural damage of left hippocampus. Nevertheless, combining fMRI and DTI method may provide markers able to contribute to the prediction of PDD."

In Thailand, the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment in surgical menopause women has not been well established. The objectives of the present study were to determine the percentage and factors associated with mild cognitive impairment in women with surgical menopause.MATERIAL AND METHOD: Between October 2013 and July 2014, 200 eligible women at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital were enrolled. The self-reported questionnaires were used to obtain the demographic data and the Thai version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The MCI was diagnosed when the MoCA score was less than 25. The data were statistically analyzed using SPSS version 17 for student t-test, Chi-square test, and multiple regression analysis.RESULTS: The percentage of MCI in the present study was 43.5%. The univariate analysis showed that factors significantly related to MCI were marital status, educational levels, occupation, monthly income, and duration of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Nevertheless, multiple regression analysis revealed that only older age at enrollment, marital status, low educational level, and low monthly income were significantly related to MCI.CONCLUSION: Almost half of the surgical menopause women in the present study had MCI. Older age at enrollment, marital status, low educational level, and low monthly income were significantly related to MCI.

Recent evidence suggests that optimising secondary prevention adherence is a critical factor in preventing recurrent stroke and the incidence of stroke-related cognitive impairment and dementia. The aim of this study was to profile cognitive impairment of stroke survivors at six months, and to identify factors associated with cognitive impairment post-stroke, focusing on indicators of adequate secondary prevention and psychological function.METHODS: Participants were assessed at six months following an ischaemic stroke as part of the Action on Secondary Prevention Interventions and Rehabilitation in Stroke study (ASPIRE-S), which examined the secondary preventive and rehabilitative profile of patients in the community post-stroke. Cognitive impairment was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).RESULTS: Two-hundred and fifty-six stroke patients were assessed at six months. Over half of the sample (56.6%) were found to have cognitive impairment, with significant associations between cognitive impairment and female sex (odds ratio (OR)<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.6, 95% CI 1.01-2.57) and history of cerebrovascular disease (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.22, 95% CI 1.38-3.59). Treatment with antihypertensive medications (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>.65, 95% CI .44-.96) and prescription of anticoagulant therapy (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>.41, 95% CI .26-.68) were associated with reduced likelihood of cognitive impairment, however increasing number of total prescribed medications was moderately associated with poorer cognitive impairment (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.12, 95% CI 1.04-1.19).CONCLUSIONS: Findings reveal levels of cognitive impairment at 6months post-stroke that are concerning. Encouragingly, aspects of secondary prevention were identified that may be protective in reducing the incidence of cognitive impairment post-stroke. Neuropsychological rehabilitation post-stroke is also required as part of stroke rehabilitation models to meet the burden of post-stroke cognitive impairment."

To determine the prevalence of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) and its subtypes in stroke survivors residing in selected rural and urban Chinese communities, we conducted a community-based, cross-sectional study in 599 patients accounting for 48% of all stroke survivors registered in the 4 communities, who had suffered confirmed strokes and had undergone cognitive assessments via the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Hachinski Ischemia Scale (HIS). Detection of PSCI was based on scores in these neuropsychological scales. Factors potentially impacting on occurrence of PSCI were explored by comparing demographic characteristics, stroke features, and cardiovascular risk factors between patients with and without PSCI. The overall prevalence of PSCI was 80.97% (95%CI: 77.82%-84.11%), while that of non-dementia PSCI (PSCI-ND) and post-stroke vascular dementia (PSD) was 48.91% (95%CI: 44.91%-52.92%) and 32.05% (95%CI: 28.32%-35.79%), respectively. Prior stroke and complications during the acute phase were independent risk factors for PSCI. The risk of recurrent stroke survivors having PSCI was 2.7 times higher than for first-episode survivors, and it was 3 times higher for those with complications during the acute phase than for those without. The higher prevalence of PSCI in this study compared with previous Chinese studies was possibly due to the combined effects of including rural stroke survivors, a longer period from stroke onset, and different assessment methods. There is an urgent need to recognize and prevent PSCI in stroke patients, especially those with recurrent stroke and complications during the acute phase. "

In the past studies, patients with neurodegenerative disease (Alzheimer dementia, AD; Parkinson's disease IPD) have problems of stereopsis but they did not have actual stimulation of stereopsis. Therefore in this study, we used a 3-dimensional (3D) movie on 3D television (TV) for actual stereopsis stimulation. We propose research through analyzing differences between the three groups (AD, IPD, and Controls), and identified relations between the results from the Titmus Stereo Fly Test, and the 3D TV test. The study also looked into factors that affect the 3D TV test. Before allowing the patients to watch TV, we examined Titmus stereo Fly Test and cognitive test. We used the 3D version of a movie, of 17 minutes 1 second duration, and carried out a questionnaire about stereopsis. The scores of the stereopsis questionnaire were decreased in AD patients, compared with in IPD and controls, although they did not have any difference of Titmus Stereo Fly Test scores. In IPD patients, cognitive function (Montreal cognitive assessment, MoCA) scores were correlated with the scores of the stereopsis questionnaire. We could conclude that Titmus fly test could not distinguish between the three groups and cognitive dysfunction contributes to actual stereopsis perception in IPD patients. Therefore the 3D TV test of AD and IPD patients was more effective than Titmus fly test. "

Eighteen subjects with genetically definite HD and 17 age-matched control subjects were evaluated on the Mini-BESTest for their clinical balance impairments as well as the Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS) motor and total functional capacity scales, Activity-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale-short form, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). Results showed that subjects with HD exhibited significantly lower total Mini-BESTest scores than subjects without HD (mean (95% CI)=76 (64-87)% with HD, 98 (96-99)% without HD; p=0.0011). Mini-BESTest item scores were significantly lower for subjects with HD on one-leg stance, postural responses, standing with eyes closed on foam, and dual-task timed up-and-go. Mini-BESTest scores significantly correlated with UHDRS motor (r(2)=0.68; p=0.00003) and total functional capacity (r(2)=0.75; p=0.000006) scores as well as with scores on the ABC short form (r(2)=0.45; p=0.0024), SDMT (r(2)=0.42; p=0.0036), and MoCA (r(2)=0.23; p=0.046) assessments. This study, therefore, demonstrates that balance impairments associated with HD span domains of anticipatory postural adjustments, postural responses, stance in challenging sensory conditions, and gait. Although preliminary, clinical balance impairment appears to be an efficient proxy evaluation of multiple HD-related factors due to associations with functional capacity, other motor impairments, balance confidence, and cognitive abilities.

Neuropsychological scales [mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA)], and Chinese medical dementia syndrome scales were performed in all subjects, and results were compared among groups or intra-group before and after treatment.RESULTS: MMSE and MoCA scores of the two treatment groups decreased more, when compared with those of the healthy control group (P &lt; 0.05). In particular, MoCA score was significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.01). MMSE and MoCA scores of the two treatment groups increased more after treatment than before treatment (P &lt; 0.05). But there was no statistical difference in MMSE or MOCA score after treatment between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05). Chinese medical dementia syndrome scales decreased more significantly in the treatment group, when compared with before treatment (P &lt; 0.01). But there was no statistical difference in Chinese medical dementia syndrome scales in the control group between before and after treatment (P &gt; 0.05). Visual spatial and executive function scores or delayed recall scores of the two treatment groups increased more, when compared with the same group before treatment (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSION: NXSM could effectively improve cognitive functions of MCI-SSVD."

The daily diet had a too high energetic value. The women consumed an excessive amount of total fat, including definitely too much monounsaturated fatty acids, and insufficient polyunsaturated fatty acids. The dietary intake of sodium and phosphorus was too high, whereas deficiencies were observed in the consumption of iron, copper, potassium, calcium, magnesium and zinc. No significant correlations were found in the analysis of cognitive functions according to the energetic value of daily diet and contents of macro- and micro-components. The results concerning verbal memory significantly depended on the daily intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Women who consumed polyunsaturated fatty acids below the daily normal or normal level obtained significantly higher results in verbal memory."

In the present study, we simultaneously examined cognitive and affective ability in MSA with predominant cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C, n=25), MSA with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P, n=8), and CCA (n=14) patients using computerized touch panel screening tests. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Hasegawa dementia scale-revised (HDS-R), frontal assessment battery (FAB), and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scores were significantly lower in MSA-C patients than in age-and gender-matched normal controls. One MSA-C patient showed a decrease in the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of the frontal lobe. MSA-P patients showed no such cognitive decline. Only FAB and MoCA scores were significantly lower in the CCA patients. MSA and CCA patients also showed a mild to moderate depressive state. Touch-panel screening tests demonstrated a significant decline of beating devils game in all three disease groups including MSA-P patients, and a significant extension of the flipping cards game only in MSA-C patients. The present study demonstrated different cognitive and affective functions among MSA-C, MSA-P, and CCA patients, and a sensitive screening method for cognitive assessment using touch-panel tests. "

"25700290","Montreal Cognitive Assessment 5-minute protocol is a brief, valid, reliable, and feasible cognitive screen for telephone administration.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network Vascular Cognitive Impairment Harmonization working group proposed a brief cognitive protocol for screening of vascular cognitive impairment. We investigated the validity, reliability, and feasibility of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 5-minute protocol (MoCA 5-minute protocol) administered over the telephone.METHODS: Four items examining attention, verbal learning and memory, executive functions/language, and orientation were extracted from the MoCA to form the MoCA 5-minute protocol. One hundred four patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack, including 53 with normal cognition (Clinical Dementia Rating, 0) and 51 with cognitive impairment (Clinical Dementia Rating, 0.5 or 1), were administered the MoCA in clinic and a month later, the MoCA 5-minute protocol over the telephone.RESULTS: Administration of the MoCA 5-minute protocol took 5 minutes over the telephone. Total score of the MoCA 5-minute protocol correlated negatively with age (r=-0.36; P&lt;0.001) and positively with years of education (r=0.41; P&lt;0.001) but not with sex (<U+03C1>=0.03; P=0.773). Total scores of the MoCA and MoCA 5-minute protocol were highly correlated (r=0.87; P&lt;0.001). The MoCA 5-minute protocol performed equally well as the MoCA in differentiating patients with cognitive impairment from those without (areas under receiver operating characteristics curve for MoCA 5-minute protocol, 0.78; MoCA=0.74; P&gt;0.05 for difference; Cohen d for group difference, 0.80-1.13). It differentiated cognitively impaired patients with executive domain impairment from those without (areas under receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.89; P&lt;0.001; Cohen d=1.7 for group difference). Thirty-day test-retest reliability was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.89).CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA 5-minute protocol is a free, valid, and reliable cognitive screen for stroke and transient ischemic attack. It is brief and highly feasible for telephone administration."
"25678141","Validity of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the HIV Dementia Scale in the assessment of cognitive impairment in HIV-1 infected patients.","The gold standard for evaluating cognitive impairments in HIV-infected patients is to administer an extensive neuropsychological assessment. This may, however, be time-consuming and hence not always feasible in the clinic. Therefore, several brief screening tools have been developed. This study determined the validity of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the HIV Dementia Scale (HDS) in detecting cognitive impairment using both the Frascati and cognitive impairment, no dementia (CIND) criteria to classify cognitive impairment in HIV-1 infected patients. The MoCA, HDS, and an extensive neuropsychological assessment, covering nine cognitive domains, were administered in a group of 102 HIV-infected patients who were all on cART and virologically suppressed for at least 1 year. Results show that the areas under the curve (AUCs) for both the MoCA and the HDS were statistically significant, using both the Frascati and the CIND criteria as gold standard. However, the AUCs for the MoCA and HDS did not differ significantly, regardless of the used classification criteria (Frascati: z<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.37, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.35; CIND: z<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.62, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.27). Sensitivity of both the MoCA and HDS were low for the recommended cutoff scores (Frascati: MoCA (&lt;26)<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.56, HDS (&lt;11)<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.26; CIND: MoCA (&lt;26)<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.55, HDS (&lt;11)<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.36). Cutoff scores with good sensitivity and adequate specificity could not be determined for both screening instruments. Therefore, the HDS and MoCA are not recommended as sole instruments to diagnose HIV-associated cognitive impairment."
"25613361","Life after cardiac arrest: A very long term follow up.","AIM: To describe survival and causes of death after cardiac arrest (CA) and the life situation of very long term survivors.METHODS: Individuals with successful resuscitation treated at the Sahlgrenska university hospital during 1995-1999 and presented in former CA publications were studied. Survival time and causes of death data were extracted from the individuals who had died's records. Very long term survivors were offered a follow up visit at home. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) used to describe cognitive abilities and EQ-5D to assess quality of life. The life situation was also explored.RESULTS: 14 out of 104 possible participants had survived to follow up. The median time to follow up among the 8 who agreed to participation was 17 years. Out of the 8 participants, 4 failed to reach the cut off score of normal cognitive abilities in the MMSE and 7/8 participants did not reach the cut off score for normal cognitive function in the MoCA. Overall the participants were content with their life situation and QoL. However, a tendency towards lower scores on the cognitive testing and a lower self-reported QoL was observed. No depression, post-traumatic stress disorder or anxiety disorder were found.CONCLUSIONS: A CA may lead to permanent cognitive impairments and the risk of dementia may be higher because of the injuries sustained during the collapse. However, further studies with more participants are needed to fully determine the risk of cognitive impairment after a CA. Regarding life situation, there was a tendency of lower QoL with lower scores on the cognitive testing. With a new treatment paradigm, there is a need for long term studies regarding this new population."
"25603424","Performance of three cognitive screening tools in a sample of older New Zealanders.","BACKGROUND: With the ubiquitous Mini-Mental State Exam now under copyright, attention is turning to alternative cognitive screening tests. The aim of the present study was to investigate three common cognitive screening tools: the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS), and the recently revised Addenbrooke's Cognitive Assessment Version III (ACE-III).METHODS: The ACE-III, MoCA and RUDAS were administered in random order to a sample of 37 participants with diagnosed mild dementia and 47 comparison participants without dementia. The diagnostic accuracy of the three tests was assessed.RESULTS: All the tests showed good overall accuracy as assessed by area under the ROC Curve, 0.89 (95% CI = 0.80-0.95) for the ACE-III, 0.84 (0.75-0.91) for the MoCA, and 0.86 (0.77-0.93) for RUDAS. The three tests were strongly correlated: r(84) = 0.85 (0.78-0.90) between the ACE-III and MoCA, 0.70 (0.57-0.80) between the ACE-III and RUDAS; and 0.65 (0.50-0.76) between the MoCA and RUDAS. The data derived optimal cut-off points for were lower than the published recommendations for the ACE-III (optimal cut-point =76, sensitivity = 81.1%, specificity = 85.1%) and the MoCA (=20, sensitivity = 78.4%, specificity = 83.0%), but similar for the RUDAS (=22, sensitivity = 78.4%, specificity = 85.1%).CONCLUSIONS: All three tools discriminated well overall between cases of mild dementia and controls. To inform interpretation of these tests in clinical settings, it would be useful for future research to address more inclusive and potentially age-stratified local norms."

Tools with sensitivity = 80% and specificity = 60% were selected. Clinical utility was assessed using a previously validated tool and those scoring &lt;6 were excluded.DATA SYNTHESIS: Twenty-one papers regarding 12 screening tools were selected. Only the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) met all psychometric and clinical utility criteria for any levels of cognitive impairment. However, the MMSE is most accurate to screen for dementia (cut-off score 23/24) and should only be used for this purpose. In addition, the following can be used to detect:  Any impairment: Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R), Barrow Neurological Institute Screen for Higher Cerebral Functions (BNIS) and Cognistat.  Multiple-domain impairments: ACE-R, Telephone-MoCA or modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS).  Dementia: TICS; Cambridge Cognitive Examination; Rotterdam-Cambridge Cognitive Examination; Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) and short-IQCODE. The IQCODE and short-IQCODE are useful when the patient is unable to respond and an informant's view is required.CONCLUSION: The MoCA is the most valid and clinically feasible screening tool to identify stroke survivors with a wide range of cognitive impairments who warrant further assessment."
"25575807","The relationship between the degree of cognitive impairment and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness.","The goal of the present study is to investigate the relationship between the degree of cognitive impairment and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness which is measured by the optical coherence tomography (OCT). Thirty-five patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 35 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 35 healthy volunteers, between the ages of 60-87, who were examined in the neurology outpatient clinic among 2012-2013 were prospectively involved in our study. Mini mental state examination (MMSE) test, montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA), and also neuropsychological test batteries were used for the neurocognitive evaluation. RNFL thickness was measured by the OCT technique and the differences among groups were studied. The relationship between RNFL thickness and MMSE scores with demographic characteristics was investigated. RNFL thickness was significantly lower in AD and MCI groups compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.01). No significant differences of RNFL were found between the MCI and the AD groups (p &gt; 0.05). Significant correlation was found between MMSE scores and the RNFL values (p &lt; 0.05). Significant thinning in RNFL along with age was detected (p &lt; 0.05). In our study, it is thought that retinal nerve fiber degeneration and central nervous system degeneration may be concurrent according to the thinning of RNFL measured by OCT in AD and MCI groups. RNFL measurement may also be useful for early diagnosis and evaluation of the disease progression. Further studies are needed to optimize the utility of this method as an ocular biomarker in AD."

Of the available methods, two base cutoffs on either the maximal test accuracy or the maximal Youden index. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of using these alternative methods of establishing cutoffs.METHODS: Datasets from three pragmatic diagnostic accuracy studies which examined the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Test Your Memory (TYM) test were analysed to calculate test sensitivity and specificity using cutoffs based on either maximal test accuracy or the maximal Youden index.RESULTS: For ACE-R, MoCA, and TYM, optimal cutoffs for dementia diagnosis differed from those in index studies when defined using either the maximal accuracy or the maximal Youden index method. Optimal cutoffs were higher for MMSE, MoCA, and TYM when using the maximal Youden index method and consequently more sensitive.CONCLUSION: Revision of the cutoffs for CSIs established in index studies may be required to optimise performance in pragmatic diagnostic test accuracy studies which more closely resemble clinical practice."

Currently, there is no known effective strategy to prevent this cognitive decline. Increasing evidence exists that physical exercise is beneficial for cognitive function. However, in patients with TIA or stroke who are at risk of cognitive impairment and dementia, only a few trials have been conducted. In this study, we aim to investigate whether a physical exercise programme (MoveIT) can prevent cognitive decline in patients in the acute phase after a TIA or minor ischaemic stroke.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A single-blinded randomised controlled trial will be conducted to investigate the effect of an aerobic exercise programme on cognition compared with usual care. 120 adult patients with a TIA or minor ischaemic stroke less than 1 month ago will be randomly allocated to an exercise programme consisting of a 12-week aerobic exercise programme and regular follow-up visits to a specialised physiotherapist during the period of 1 year or to usual care. Outcome measures will be assessed at the baseline, and at the 1-year and 2-year follow-up. The primary outcome is cognitive functioning measured with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test and with additional neuropsychological tests. Secondary outcomes include maximal exercise capacity, self-reported physical activity and measures of secondary prevention.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study received ethical approval from the VU University Amsterdam Ethics committee (2011/383). The results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international conferences. We will also disseminate the main results to our participants in a letter.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The Nederlands Trial Register NTR3884."
"28013571","Short Montreal Cognitive Assessment.","The diagnostic accuracy of the short Montreal Cognitive Assessment (s-MoCA), a cognitive screening instrument recently derived by item response theory and computerized adaptive testing from the original MoCA, for the diagnosis of dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was assessed in 2 patient cohorts referred to a dedicated memory clinic in order to examine the validity and reproducibility of s-MoCA. Diagnosis used standard clinical diagnostic criteria for dementia and MCI as reference standard (prevalence of cognitive impairment = 0.43 and 0.46 in each cohort, respectively). There were significant differences in s-MoCA test scores for dementia, MCI, and subjective memory impairment ( P = .01), and s-MoCA effect sizes (Cohen d) were medium to large (range: 0.65-1.42) for the diagnosis of dementia and MCI. Using the cut-off for s-MoCA specified in the index study, it proved highly sensitive (&gt;0.9) for diagnosis of dementia but with poor specificity (=0.25), with moderate sensitivity (=0.75) and specificity (=0.60) for diagnosis of MCI. In conclusion, in these pragmatic diagnostic test accuracy studies, s-MoCA proved acceptable and sensitive for the diagnosis of cognitive impairment in a memory clinic setting, with a performance similar to that of the original MoCA."

Meta-analysis.","OBJECTIVES: Screening tests play a crucial role in dementia diagnostics, thus they should be very sensitive for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) assessment. Nowadays, the MiniMental State Examination (MMSE) is the most commonly used scale in cognitive function evaluation, albeit it is claimed to be imprecise for MCI detection. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), was created as an alternative method for MMSE. Aim. MoCA vs. MMSE credibility assessment in detecting MCI, while taking into consideration the sensitivity and specificity by cut-off points.METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out by the authors using EBSCO host Web, Wiley Online Library, Springer Link, Science Direct and Medline databases. The following medical subject headings were used in the search: mild cognitive impairment, mini-mental state examination, Montreal cognitive assessment, diagnostics value. Papers which met inclusion and exclusion criteria were chosen to be included in this review. At the end, for the evaluation of MoCA 20, and MMSE 13 studies were qualified. Research credibility was established by computing weighted arithmetic mean, where weight is defined as population for which the result of sensitivity and specificity for the cut-off point was achieved. The cut-offs are shown as ROC curve and accuracy of diagnosis for MoCA and MMSE was calculated as the area under the curve (AUC).RESULTS: ROC curve analysis for MoCA demonstrated that MCI best detection can be achieved with a cut-off point of 24/25 (n = 9350, the sensitivity of 80.48% and specificity of 81.19%). AUC was 0.846 (95% CI 0.823-0.868). For MMSE, it turned out that more important cut-off was of 27/28 (n = 882, 66.34% sensitivity and specificity of 72.94%).

We used two 3.0-tesla MRI scanners and performed manual hippocampal volumetry.CONCLUSION: Psychometric test (MMSE and MoCA) scores had a good to strong positive correlation with statistically significant differences in the entire population and healthy subjects but not among dementia patients and lower educational level groups. The patients with low education had greater hippocampal volumes, which is in line with the cognitive reserve theory; lower-educated individuals can tolerate less neuropathology and will thus show less atrophy at a similar level of cognitive performance than higher-educated subjects."

This study aimed to investigate the effects of a 16-week aerobic exercise intervention on cognitive function in people with HIV. Eleven participants living with HIV were recruited into the study. Participants were randomised into either an exercise group (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>5), that completed a 16-week aerobic exercise programme training, 3 times per week (2 supervised sessions and one unsupervised session) or a control group (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>6) that received no intervention. Outcomes measured included cognitive function (Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA) and the Trail making tests A and B), aerobic fitness (modified Bruce protocol), sleep quality (Pittsburgh sleep quality index; PSQI) and physical activity levels (seven-day accelerometry). At baseline, higher levels of moderate physical activity were positively correlated with higher MOCA scores and levels of aerobic fitness were negatively associated with Trail A scores (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.04 and P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001 respectively). However, exercise training did not induce any significant improvements in cognitive function or aerobic fitness. The overall mean adherence rate to the exercise programme was 60%. In conclusion, in the present study a 16-week aerobic exercise intervention did not affect the cognitive function of participants with HIV. It is likely that longer intervention periods and/or higher adherence rates to exercise might be needed for an aerobic exercise programme to be effective in improving cognitive function in a cohort with no baseline cognitive impairments."

Seven hundred participants were recruited (older than 18 years old). The effect of age, level of education and sex was analyzed on the performance of MoCA and percentiles and scalar score for nine ranges of age and scalar score adjusted by the level of education.RESULTS: Results showed a significant effect of age, level of education and sex on the cognitive performance of MoCA. However, sex was only significant in two domains (attention and delayed recall). Age, education and sex explained from 1.0% to 32.3% of the variance of the performance. The older participants with lower level of formal education obtained the worse performance shown in MoCA. Percentiles and scalar score for each range of age, and scalar score adjusted by the level of education were obtained.CONCLUSION: The normative data of the MoCA is provided taking into account the Spanish sociodemographic characteristics for adults in Spain and the cut-off to distinguish between normal cognitive performance and mild cognitive impairment according to different range of ages have been proposed.TITLE: Test de evaluacion cognitiva de Montreal: normalizacion y estandarizacion de la prueba en poblacion espaola.Introduccion.

Se analizaron el efecto de la edad, el nivel educativo y el sexo sobre el rendimiento del test MoCA, y se crearon los percentiles, las puntuaciones escalares para nueve rangos de edad y la puntuacion escalar normalizada ajustada por edad y nivel educativo. Resultados. Los resultados mostraron un efecto significativo de la edad, el nivel educativo y el sexo sobre el rendimiento cognitivo en el test MoCA. Sin embargo, el sexo solo presento un efecto significativo sobre dos dominios cognitivos: atencion y recuerdo diferido. La edad, la educacion y el sexo explicaron entre el 1% y el 32,3% de la varianza en las variables analizadas del test. Los participantes mas mayores con menor nivel de educacion formal obtuvieron peor rendimiento cognitivo. Se obtuvieron los percentiles y las puntuaciones escalares para cada rango de edad y la puntuacion escalar normalizada individual. Conclusion. Se presentan los datos normativos del test MoCA adecuados a las caracteristicas sociodemograficas de la sociedad espaola y los puntos de corte propuestos para discriminar entre rendimiento cognitivo normal y deterioro cognitivo leve segun los diferentes rangos de edad."
"27866858","Clinical variables and biomarkers in prediction of cognitive impairment in patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease: a cohort study.","BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease is associated with an increased incidence of cognitive impairment and dementia. Predicting who is at risk of cognitive decline early in the disease course has implications for clinical prognosis and for stratification of participants in clinical trials. We assessed the use of clinical information and biomarkers as predictive factors for cognitive decline in patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease.METHODS: The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study is a cohort study in patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease. We evaluated cognitive performance (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] scores), demographic and clinical data, APOE status, and biomarkers (CSF and dopamine transporter [DAT] imaging results). Using change in MoCA scores over 2 years, MoCA scores at 2 years' follow-up, and a diagnosis of cognitive impairment (combined mild cognitive impairment or dementia) at 2 years as outcome measures, we assessed the predictive values of baseline clinical variables and separate or combined additions of APOE status, DAT imaging, and CSF biomarkers. We did univariate and multivariate linear analyses with MoCA change scores between baseline and 2 years, and with MoCA scores at 2 years as dependent variables, using backwards linear regression analysis. Additionally, we constructed a prediction model for diagnosis of cognitive impairment using logistic regression analysis.INTERPRETATION: In newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease, the occurrence of cognitive impairment at 2 year follow-up can be predicted with good accuracy using a model combining information on age, non-motor assessments, DAT imaging, and CSF biomarkers.FUNDING: None."
"27855415","Instrumented Trail-Making Task to Differentiate Persons with No Cognitive Impairment, Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Alzheimer Disease: A Proof of Concept Study.","BACKGROUND: Objective and time-effective tools are needed to identify motor-cognitive impairment and facilitate early intervention.OBJECTIVE: We examined the feasibility, accuracy, and reliability of an instrumented trail-making task (iTMT) using a wearable sensor to identify motor-cognitive impairment among older adults.METHODS: Thirty subjects (age = 82.2 + 6.1 years, body mass index = 25.7 + 4.8, female = 43.3%) in 3 age-matched groups, 11 healthy, 10 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 9 with Alzheimer disease (AD), were recruited. Subjects completed iTMT, using a wearable sensor attached to the leg, which translates the motion of the ankle into a human-machine interface. iTMT tests included reaching to 5 indexed circles on a computer screen by moving the ankle-joint while standing. iTMT was quantified by the time required to reach all circles in the correct sequence. Three iTMT tests were designed, including numbers (1-5) positioned in a fixed (iTMTfixed) or random (iTMTrandom) order, or numbers (1-3) and letters (A and B) positioned in random order (iTMTnumber-letter). Each test was repeated twice to examine test-retest reliability. In addition, the conventional trail-making task (TMT A and B), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and dual-task cost (DTC: gait-speed difference between walking alone and walking while counting backward) were used as references. Re sults: Good-to-excellent reliability was achieved for all iTMT tests (intraclass correlation [ICC] = 0.742-0.836). Between-group difference was more pronounced, when using iTMTnumber-letter, with average completion time of 26.3  12.4, 37.8  14.1, and 61.8  34.1 s, respectively, for healthy, aMCI, and AD groups (p = 0.006). Pairwise comparison suggested strong effect sizes between AD and healthy (Cohen's d = 1.384, p = 0.001) and between aMCI and AD (d = 0.923, p = 0.028). Significant correlation was observed when comparing iTMTnumber-letter with MoCA (r = -0.598, p = 0.001), TMT A (r = 0.519, p = 0.006), TMT B (r = 0.666, p &lt; 0.001), and DTC (r = 0.713, p &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated proof of concept of a simple, safe, and practical iTMT system with promising results to identify cognitive and dual-task ability impairment among older adults, including those with aMCI and AD. Future studies need to confirm these observations in larger samples, as well as iTMT's ability to track motor-cognitive decline over time."
"27847677","The Use of MoCA and Other Cognitive Tests in Evaluation of Cognitive Impairment in Elderly Patients Undergoing Arthroplasty.","OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence and effect of cognitive impairment on treatment outcomes in elderly patients undergoing arthroplasty and to describe the feasibility of cognitive tests.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The participants were 52 patients with a mean age of 78 years 11 months (SD: 3.3), waiting for primary arthroplasty. We translated Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) into Finnish and compared it with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Mini-Cog, and clock-drawing tests prior to and 3 months after the surgery. The ability to perform activities of daily living, depression, quality of life, and years of education were evaluated.CONCLUSION: The prevalence of cognitive impairment among older patients presenting for arthroplasty is high and mostly undiagnosed. It is feasible to use the MoCA to identify cognitive impairment preoperatively in this group. The clock-drawing test was abnormal in all patients with postoperative delirium, which could be used as a screening test. Higher education predicted survival on a 5-year follow-up period."
"27823981","Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation improves cognitive function of Alzheimer's disease patients.","Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) acts as a kind of widely-applied and non-invasive method in the intervention of some neurological disorders. This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigates the effect of rTMS on 30 cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD) participants, who were classified into mild and moderate groups. Neuropsychological tests were carried out using the AD Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and World Health Organization University of California-Los Angeles, Auditory Verbal Learning Test (WHO-UCLA AVLT) before, immediately after, and 6 weeks after the intervention. In this work, data from 30 AD patients revealed that there was no obvious interaction effect of time-by-group. The ADAS-cog, MMSE and WHO-UCLA AVLT score in the rTMS group was significantly improved compared with baselines at 6 weeks after treatment (all p&lt;0.05). Meanwhile, MoCA scores were also obviously ameliorated in the mild AD patients with rTMS. Besides, subgroup analysis showed that the effect of rTMS on the memory and language of mild AD patients was superior to those of moderate AD patients. In conclusion, our findings suggested that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation improves cognitive function, memory and language level of AD patients, especially in the mild stage of AD. Thus, rTMS can be recommended as a promising adjuvant therapy combined with cholinesterase inhibitors at the mild stage of AD patients."
"26845223","Determining appropriate screening tools and cut-points for cognitive impairment in an elderly Chinese sample.","The establishment of normative data and screening cut-points for cognitive tasks is important to ensure the effective and timely detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). These need to be culturally relevant and account for known factors that impact on cognition such as age, education, and gender. In this study, 1,068 elderly Chinese residents of Shanghai completed a comprehensive series of cognitive tasks as part of a community screening study with 1027 meeting criteria for analysis, age M(SD) = 72.54 (8.40). MCI was detected in 267 individuals, AD in 50, and 710 had normal cognition. Receiver Operator Characteristic curve analysis indicated that the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) best differentiated normal cognition from MCI and AD. We present suggested cut-points to differentiate between normal cognition and MCI and AD for the total sample, and when split according to education levels, age, and gender. Trends suggest that the MoCA was better suited to detecting MCI, and the MMSE was better for detecting AD. For younger and more educated participants, only a slight impairment was necessary to meet screening criteria, while a larger impairment was necessary for older and less educated participants. Both tasks had a high negative predictive values for MCI and AD, and variable positive predictive values. The cut-points presented can be used to inform future work using the MMSE and MoCA to screen for MCI and AD in older Chinese people. (PsycINFO Database Record"
"27804110","Cognitive function in stroke survivors: A 10-year follow-up study.","OBJECTIVES: Post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) has considerable impact on patients and society. However, long-term studies on PSCI are scarce and may be influenced by assessment methods and selection bias. We aimed to (i) assess the prevalence of long-term PSCI; (ii) compare two common cognitive assessment instruments; and (iii) compare cognitive function of long-term stroke survivors with non-stroke persons.METHODS: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were administered to 10-year survivors from a population-based cohort of first-ever stroke patients included in the Lund Stroke Register, Sweden, in 2001-2002. PSCI was defined as MMSE&lt;27 and/or MoCA&lt;25 and severe cognitive impairment as MMSE&lt;23. Age- and sex-matched non-stroke control subjects who had performed MMSE (but not MoCA) were recruited from the longitudinal population study &quot;Good Ageing in Skne.&quot; The odds of having cognitive impairment for stroke survivors compared to controls were examined with logistic regression analyses adjusting for education.RESULTS: Of 145 stroke survivors after 10years, 127 participated. MMSE showed PSCI in 46%, whereas MoCA displayed PSCI in 61%. Among the stroke survivors with MoCA&lt;25, 35% had MMSE=27 (P&lt;.001). The odds of having severe cognitive impairment defined as MMSE&lt;23 were higher among the stroke survivors compared to 354 controls (education-adjusted; OR=2.5; P=.004).CONCLUSIONS: Post-stroke cognitive impairment was prevalent among 10-year stroke survivors, and the odds of having severe cognitive impairment were higher among the stroke survivors compared to non-stroke persons. The burden of long-term PSCI might have been underestimated previously, and MoCA may be more suitable than MMSE to detect long-term PSCI."

The odds ratio (OR) was calculated using logistic analyses to assess the association between oxysterols and MCI.RESULTS: Compared with controls with normal cognition, plasma level of 27-OHC was significantly higher in MCI patients. Logistic analyses suggested high plasma level of 27-OHC was significantly associated with MCI even after multivariate adjustment (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.86, 95% CI: 1.52<U+2009>~<U+2009>5.37).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that the increased plasma level of 27-OHC was associated with MCI, suggesting high plasma levels of 27-OHC may pay an important role in the development of MCI."

An impact of CMB on cognitive functions and the relationship with signs of vascular and neurodegenerative lesions of the brain were studied as well. The neuropsychological battery included Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale (MoCA), Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-R), Clock Drawing Test, fluency test and the visual memory test (SCT).RESULTS: CMB were identified in more than one third of patients with neurodegenerative or cerebrovascular disease. With regard to disease, they were detected preferably in cortical or subcortical areas, respectively. This result can be used in the differential diagnosis. Single subcortical CMB accompanied by a smaller number of lacunae and less severe leukoaraiosis were identified in 48% of patients with DLB. In AD with additional features of DLB and cerebrovascular disease, CMB were more common (60%) that was a predictor of mixed pathology.CONCLUSION: Leukoaraiosis, if accompanied by CMB, has a great clinical significance in neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases with cognitive impairment. CMB is a marker of severe cognitive impairment and predictor of mixed pathology in the cortical-subcortical localization of CMB and corresponding neuropsychological profile."

MATERIAL AND METHODS The study group consisted of 210 women. The inclusion criteria were: minimum 2 years after the last menstruation, FSH concentration 30 U/ml, and no dementia signs on Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). A computerized battery of Central Nervous System Vital Signs (CNS VS) test was used to diagnose cognitive functions. Genotyping of the ERa polymorphism was performed using a polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzymes (PCR-RFLP). Blood plasma was tested for FSH and estradiol (E2). Statistical analysis was performed using STATISTICA software. RESULTS A relationship was confirmed between standard scores for 3 cognitive functions: general memory, verbal memory, and processing speed, and the XbaI polymorphism in the women in the study. In the group of women with genotype TT PvuII, significant positive relationships were observed between the concentration of E2 and the standard scores of 3 cognitive functions: general memory, verbal memory, and processing speed. In the group of women with genotype TC PvuII, significant negative correlations were found between the concentration of E2 and the standard scores of 4 cognitive functions: NCI, general memory, verbal memory, and processing speed. CONCLUSIONS ERa polymorphism exerted an effect on the interaction between the concentration of estradiol and the results for cognitive functions. The concentration of estradiol did not depend on Xba1 and PvuII polymorphisms. The results for cognitive functions depended on which Xba1 polymorphism the woman carried."

Random-effects hierarchical logistic regressions were performed to assess the relative performance of the normal control (NC), participants with HD, and participants with AD on verbal free recall, cued recall, and multiple-choice recognition on the MoCA. The NC participants performed significantly better than participants with AD at all the 3 levels of assessment. No difference existed between participants with HD and NC for cued recall, but NC participants performed significantly better than participants with HD on free recall and recognition. The participants with HD performed significantly better than participants with AD at all the 3 levels of assessment. The MoCA appears to be a valuable, brief cognitive assessment capable of identifying specific memory deficits consistent with known differences in memory profiles."
"27667187","The MMSE and MoCA for Screening Cognitive Impairment in Less Educated Patients with Parkinson's Disease.","OBJECTIVE: To explore whether the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) can be used to screen for dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in less educated patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of PD patients who had taken the Korean MMSE (K-MMSE), Korean MoCA (K-MoCA), and comprehensive neuropsychological tests. Predictive values of the K-MMSE and K-MoCA for dementia or MCI were analyzed in groups divided by educational level.RESULTS: The discriminative powers of the K-MMSE and K-MoCA were excellent [area under the curve (AUC) 0.86-0.97] for detecting dementia but not for detecting MCI (AUC 0.64-0.85). The optimal screening cutoff values of both tests increased with educational level for dementia (K-MMSE &lt; 15 for illiterate, &lt; 20 for 0.5-3 years of education, &lt; 23 for 4-6 years, &lt; 25 for 7-9 years, and &lt; 26 for 10 years or more; K-MoCA &lt; 7 for illiterate, &lt; 13 for 0.5-3 years, &lt; 16 for 4-6 years, &lt; 19 for 7-9 years, &lt; 20 for 10 years or more) and MCI (K-MMSE &lt; 19 for illiterate, &lt; 26 for 0.5-3 years, &lt; 27 for 4-6 years, &lt; 28 for 7-9 years, and &lt; 29 for 10 years or more; K-MoCA &lt; 13 for illiterate, &lt; 21 for 0.5-3 years, &lt; 23 for 4-6 years, &lt; 25 for 7-9 years, &lt; 26 for 10 years or more).CONCLUSION: Both MMSE and MoCA can be used to screen for dementia in patients with PD, regardless of educational level; however, neither test is sufficient to discriminate MCI from normal cognition without additional information."

"27625048","Normative Data for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in Middle-Aged and Elderly Quebec-French People.","OBJECTIVE: Given that aging is associated with higher risk of cognitive decline and dementia, improving early detection of cognitive impairment has become a research and clinical priority. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a screening instrument used to assess different aspects of cognition. Despite its widespread use, norms adjusted to the sociodemographics of Quebec-French people are not yet available. Such norms are however important because performance on neuropsychological tests varies according to sociodemographic variables including age, sex, and education. As such, the present study aimed to establish normative data for the MoCA in middle-aged and elderly Quebec-French population.METHOD: For that purpose, 1,019 community-dwelling older adults aged between 41 and 98 were recruited. Participants from 12 recruiting sites completed the MoCA. Regression-based normative data were produced and cross-validated with a validation sample (n=200).CONCLUSIONS: This study provides normative data for the MoCA test in the middle-aged and elderly French-Quebec people. These data will facilitate more accurate detection and follow-up of the risk of cognitive impairment in this population, taking into account culture, age, education, and sex."

Prompt management of MCI can prevent vascular dementia and improve patient outcome. This single center randomized controlled trial aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture and nimodipine to treat post-cerebral infarction MCI.METHODS: A total of 126 Chinese patients with post-cerebral infarction MCI recruited from the First Teaching Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine between April 2013 and June 2014 were randomized at 1:1: 1 ratio into nimodipine alone (30mg/time and 3 times daily), acupuncture alone (30min/time, 6 times/week), and nimodipine<U+2009>+<U+2009>acupuncture groups. The treatments were 3months. Cognitive function was evaluated using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale at enrollment interview, at the end of 3-month therapy, and at the post-treatment 3-month follow-up.RESULTS: The per-protocol set included 39, 40, and 40 patients from nimodipine alone, acupuncture alone, and the combination group, respectively, was analyzed. Intra-group comparison revealed that MoCA score at the follow-up improved significantly by 15.8<U+2009><U+2009>10.9, 20.9<U+2009><U+2009>13.8%, and 30.2<U+2009><U+2009>19.7% compared with the baseline MoCA for nimodipine alone, acupuncture alone, and the combination group, respectively. Inter-group comparison demonstrated that the combination therapy improved MoCA score (5.5<U+2009><U+2009>2.2) at significantly higher extent than nimodipine alone (3.1<U+2009><U+2009>1.8) and acupuncture alone (4.3<U+2009><U+2009>2.3) at the follow-up (All P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05), and significantly higher proportion of patients in acupuncture alone group (80%) and the combination therapy group (90%) than in nimodipine alone group (56.4%) showed =12% MoCA score improvement compared with the baseline MoCA (All P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05).

"27593974","Sensitivity of the Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III to everyday activity impairments in dementia: an exploratory study.","OBJECTIVE: The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is one of the most frequently used cognitive measures for dementia severity and linked to deficits in everyday functioning. Recently, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III) increasingly substitute for the MMSE. However, there are no specific cutoffs in the ACE-III for mild dementia. The objectives of this exploratory study were to assess the sensitivity of each scale to everyday functioning and to examine the cutoffs between mild and moderate dementia on the ACE-III.METHODS: People with mild dementia completed the MMSE, MoCA and ACE-III, whilst informal carers completed the Revised Interview for Deteriorations in Daily Living Activities for Dementia to rate their relative's initiative and performance of instrumental activities of daily living and the Katz activities of daily living scale. Data were analysed using correlation analysis, raw score comparisons, Cohen's kappa and receiver operating characteristics analysis.RESULTS: Thirty-three dyads completed the measures. The ACE-III was the most sensitive tool for everyday functioning performance, whilst its language subscale was specifically related to initiation of activities. The most suitable cutoff on the ACE-III between mild and moderate dementia was 61.CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest the ACE-III more efficiently identifies everyday functional impairments. Further research is required to confirm these exploratory analyses of the cutoff between mild and moderate dementia on the ACE-III. Both functional impairment and stage of dementia are needed in the diagnostic process and in the clinical assessment of people with dementia. Copyright  2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd."
"27567829","A Six-Month Cognitive-Motor and Aerobic Exercise Program Improves Executive Function in Persons with an Objective Cognitive Impairment: A Pilot Investigation Using the Antisaccade Task.","Persons with an objective cognitive impairment (OCI) are at increased risk for progression to Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The present pilot project sought to examine whether participation in a long-term exercise program involving cognitive-motor (CM) dual-task gait training and aerobic exercise training improves executive function in persons with an OCI. To accomplish our objective, individuals with an OCI (n<U+200A>=<U+200A>12) as determined by a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of less than 26 and older adults (n<U+200A>=<U+200A>11) deemed to be cognitively healthy (i.e., control group: MoCA score =26) completed a six-month moderate-to-high intensity (65-85% maximum heart rate) treadmill-based CM and aerobic exercise training program wherein pre- and post-intervention executive control was examined via the antisaccade task. Notably, antisaccades require a goal-directed eye-movement mirror-symmetrical to a target and represent an ideal tool for the study of executive deficits because of its hands- and language-free nature. As well, the cortical networks mediating antisaccades represent regions associated with neuropathology in cognitive decline and dementia (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). Results showed that antisaccade reaction times for the OCI group reliably decreased by 30<U+200A>ms from pre- to post-intervention, whereas the control group did not produce a reliable pre- to post-intervention change in reaction time (i.e., 6<U+200A>ms). Thus, we propose that in persons with OCI long-term CM and aerobic training improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the executive mechanisms mediating high-level oculomotor control."

Participants underwent a clinical interview and serial neuropsychological testing. ADAS-Cog total and subtest scores were compared across the 3 groups. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis were performed and sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs) were calculated.RESULTS: Patients with MCI attained significantly worse neuropsychological test scores than healthy controls but significantly better results than patients with mild AD on ADAS-Cog total score, subtest items, and the delayed recall item (P &lt;0.001). The best cutoff score to differentiate between MCI and HC was =4 (sensitivity = 0.73, specificity = 0.69, PPV = 0.90, NPV = 0.40), while the best cutoff score to distinguish between MCI and mild AD was =12 (sensitivity = 0.86, specificity = 0.89, PPV = 0.99, NPV = 0.32). Evidence of internal consistency of the ADAS-Cog (Cronbach a = 0.85) as well as convergent validity with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (<U+03C1> = -0.75) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (<U+03C1> = -0.81) (both P &lt;0.001) was also found.CONCLUSION: The ADAS-Cog which is widely used in clinical trials is applicable to the Asian cohort.

Previous research has demonstrated correlations between ADL-Q and cognitive screening measures among patients with dementia. This study examined the relationship between ADL-Q and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a brief cognitive screening.METHODS: Records of 448 individuals from an outpatient neurology clinic were reviewed. Pearson correlations were calculated between ADL-Q scores and MoCA scores. Linear regression models were fit using demographic information to predict ADL-Q scores. MoCA scores were then added to the models to determine the increase in predictive value of the MoCA.RESULTS: Lower MoCA scores were associated with higher levels of functional impairment. For each model, adding the MoCA significantly improved model fit.DISCUSSION: Low scores on the MoCA, among patient's presenting for memory complaints, should raise concerns about functional decline and prompt for further assessment of functional ability."

However, no empirical evidence is available to determine how much a cognitive impairment shortens survival in older patients when cancer treatment is initiated.PURPOSE: To longitudinally investigate how much a cognitive impairment detected at the initiation of cancer treatment influences survival of older patients during a two-year follow-up duration and to compare the predictive value of a cognitive impairment on patients survival with the predictive value of other vulnerabilities associated with older age.METHODS: Three hundred and fifty-seven consecutive patients (=65 years old) admitted for breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer surgeries were prospectively recruited. A cognitive impairment was assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA&lt;26). Socio-demographic, disease-related, and geriatric vulnerabilities were assessed using validated tools. Univariate and subsequent multivariate Cox proportional hazards models stratified for diagnosis (breast/prostate cancer versus colorectal cancer) and disease status (metastatic versus non-metastatic) were used.RESULTS: A cognitive impairment was detected in 46% (n = 163) of patients. Survival was significantly influenced by a cognitive impairment (HR = 6.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.07-18.09; p = 0.001), a loss in instrumental autonomy (IADL =7) (HR = 3.06; 95% CI = 1.31-7.11; p = 0.009) and fatigue (Mob-T&lt;5) (HR = 5.98; 95% CI = 2.47-14.44; p &lt;0.001).CONCLUSIONS: During the two years following cancer treatment initiation, older patients with a cognitive impairment were up to six times more likely to die than patients without. Older patients should be screened for cognitive impairments at cancer treatment initiation to enable interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality. Further studies should address processes underlying the relationship between cognitive impairments and an increased risk of dying in older cancer patients."

Elevated level of p-Tau181 can differentiate AD from other neurodegenerative disease. However, the expression level of these proteins in serum of AD patient is not well set up. This study sought to evaluate the level of Tau and p-Tau181 in serum of AD, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients for an alternative approach to establish protein-based markers by convenient way. Blood samples were collected from 39 AD patients, 37 MCI patients and 37 elderly individuals as controls. The levels of Tau and p-Tau181 in the serum of the different groups were measured by label free real time Surface Plasmon Resonance technology by using specific antibodies, and were further confirmed by the conventional western blot method. An appropriate statistical analysis, including Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), was performed. The concentrations of serum Tau and p-Tau181 were significantly higher (p&lt;0.00001) in AD (Tau; 47.499.00ng/L, p-Tau181; 0.1610.04 ng/L) compared to MCI (Tau; 39.267.78 ng/L, p-Tau181; 0.1350.02 ng/L) and were further higher compared to elderly controls (Tau; 34.926.58 ng/L, p-Tau181; 0.1220.01 ng/ L). A significant (p&lt;0.0001) downhill correlation was found between Tau as well as p-Tau181 levels with HMSE and MoCA score. This study for the first time reports the concentration of Tau and p-Tau181 in serum of AD and MCI patients. The cutoff values of Tau and p-Tau181 of AD and MCI patients with sensitivity and specificity reveal that serum level of these proteins can be used as a predictive marker for AD and MCI. "

"27437705","Screening for Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson's Disease: Improving the Diagnostic Utility of the MoCA through Subtest Weighting.","BACKGROUND: Given the high prevalence of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD), cognitive screening is important in clinical practice. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a frequently used screening test in PD to detect mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PD-D). However, the proportion in which the subtests are represented in the MoCA total score does not seem reasonable. We present the development and preliminary evaluation of an empirically based alternative scoring system of the MoCA which aims at increasing the overall diagnostic accuracy.METHODS: In study 1, the MoCA was administered to 40 patients with PD without cognitive impairment (PD-N), PD-MCI, or PD-D, as defined by a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. The new MoCA scoring algorithm was developed by defining Areas under the Curve (AUC) for MoCA subtests in a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and by weighting the subtests according to their sensitivities and specificities. In study 2, an independent sample of 24 PD patients (PD-N, PD-MCI, or PD-D) was tested with the MoCA. In both studies, diagnostic accuracy of the original and the new scoring procedure was calculated.RESULTS: Diagnostic accuracy increased with the new MoCA scoring algorithm. In study 1, the sensitivity to detect cognitive impairment increased from 62.5% to 92%, while specificity decreased only slightly from 77.7% to 73%; in study 2, sensitivity increased from 68.8% to 81.3%, while specificity stayed stable at 75%.CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrates that the sensitivity of the MoCA can be enhanced substantially by an empirically based weighting procedure and that the proposed scoring algorithm may serve the MoCA's actual purpose as a screening tool in the detection of cognitive dysfunction in PD patients better than the original scoring of the MoCA. Further research with larger sample sizes is necessary to establish efficacy of the alternate scoring system."
"27427212","Comparison of the Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment (Qmci) screen to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in an Australian geriatrics clinic.","INTRODUCTION: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) accurately differentiates mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from mild dementia and normal controls (NC). While the MoCA is validated in multiple clinical settings, few studies compare it with similar tests also designed to detect MCI. We sought to investigate how the shorter Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment (Qmci) screen compares with the MoCA.METHODS: Consecutive referrals presenting with cognitive complaints to a teaching hospital geriatric clinic (Fremantle, Western Australia) underwent a comprehensive assessment and were classified as MCI (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>72) or dementia (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>109). NC (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>41) were a sample of convenience. The Qmci and MoCA were scored by trained geriatricians, in random order, blind to the diagnosis.RESULTS: Median Qmci scores for NC, MCI and dementia were 69 (+/-19), 52.5 (+/-12) and 36 (+/-14), respectively, compared with 27 (+/-5), 22 (+/-4) and 15 (+/-7) for the MoCA. The Qmci more accurately identified cognitive impairment (MCI or dementia), area under the curve (AUC) 0.97, than the MoCA (AUC 0.92), p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.04. The Qmci was non-significantly more accurate in distinguishing MCI from controls (AUC 0.91 vs 0.84, respectively<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.16). Both instruments had similar accuracy for differentiating MCI from dementia (AUC of 0.91 vs 0.88, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.35). At the optimal cut-offs, calculated from receiver operating characteristic curves, the Qmci (=57) had a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 93% for cognitive impairment, compared with 87% sensitivity and 80% specificity for the MoCA (=23).CONCLUSION: While both instruments are accurate in detecting MCI, the Qmci is shorter and arguably easier to complete, suggesting that it is a useful instrument in an Australian geriatric outpatient population.

The study was performed at two trial sites. We studied 136 outpatients with cognitive decline. MRI was performed using a magnetic field of 1.5 and 3 T. Neuropsychological assessment included Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale (MoCA), Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-R), Cambridge Cognitive Examination battery (CAMCOG) (Part 3), Clock Drawing Test, fluency test and the visual memory test (SCT). CSF was examined for standard parameters such as tau, phosphorylated tau, amyloid- 1-40 and 42 and Qalbumin, in accordance with established protocols and genotype. In 61 patients (45%), at least 1 CMB was found. Most of the CMBs were described in the amnestic profile (67%). In 86% of the cases, multiple CMB were observed. The ratio of A1-40/42 in non-amnestic patients with CMB was significantly lower (mean 0.6) than in patients without CMB (mean 1.2). A notable difference in the albumin ratio as an indicator of the BBB was observed between groups with and without CMB. In the CMP-positive group, the E2 genotype was observed more frequently, and the E4 genotype less frequently, than in the CMB-negative group. Based on the cerebrospinal fluid-serum albumin ratio, we were able to show that patients with CMB present several features of BBB dysfunction. According to logistic regression, the predictive factors for CMB in patients with cognitive decline were age, WMHs score and albumin ratio. We found a significant reduction in the A-amyloid ratio in the non-amnestic profile group with CMB (particularly in the cortical region) in comparison to those without CMB. While this is an interesting finding, its significance needs to be assessed in a prospective follow-up. "

The present study explores the behavioral, cognitive and functional effects of memantine on behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) in patients with mild and moderate-to-severe stage bvFTD. A total of 42 patients with bvFTD completed a 6-month treatment plan of 20 mg memantine daily in an open-label, self-controlled clinical trial. Patients were divided into two groups according to their Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score: Mild (score, 21-26); and moderate-to-severe (score, 4-20). Primary endpoints included Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) and Clinic Dementia Rating (CDR) scores, and secondary endpoints comprised Neuropsychiatric Inventory Caregiver Distress Scale (NPI-D), MMSE, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Activity of Daily Life (ADL) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores. Memantine treatment had no effect on overall NPI-Q scores, with the exception of the agitation subdomain in all patients with bvFTD. However, patients with moderate-to-severe bvFTD exhibited a better performance than patients with mild bvFTD, demonstrated by improved NPI-Q total scores and subscales of agitation, depression, apathy and disinhibition. In the moderate-to-severe group, CDR and HAMD scores remained stable, but MMSE, MoCA and ADL scores were reduced after 6 months of treatment. Memantine was well-tolerated in patients. In conclusion, patients with moderate-to-severe bvFTD responded significantly better to memantine in comparison to patients with mild bvFTD with regard to their neuropsychiatric scores, while memantine did not present any cognitive or functional benefits in patients with mild bvFTD. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with a larger number of patients is required to verify these promising results for patients with moderate-to-severe bvFTD."

In this multicenter observational study, MMSE and MoCA were administered in a random order to 130 patients: 35 MSA, 30 PSP and 65 age, and education and gender matched-PD. We assessed between-group differences for MMSE, MoCA, and their subitems. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated. The mean MMSE was higher than the mean MoCA score in each MSA (27.72.4 vs. 22.93.0, p&lt;0.0001), PSP (26.02.9 vs. 18.23.9, p&lt;0.0001), and PD (27.32.0 vs. 22.33.5, p&lt;0.0001). MoCA total score as well as its letter fluency subitem differentiated PSP from MSA and PD with high specificity and moderate sensitivity. More specifically, a cut-off score of 7 F-words or less per minute would support a diagnosis of PSP (PSP vs. PD: 86% specificity, 70% sensitivity; PSP vs. MSA: 71% specificity, 70% sensitivity). By contrast, MMSE presented an overall ceiling effect for most subitems, except for the pentagon scores, where PSP did less well than MSA or PD patients. These preliminary results suggest that PSP and MSA, similar to PD patients, may present normal MMSE and reduced MoCA performance. Overall, MoCA is more sensitive than MMSE in detecting cognitive impairment in atypical parkinsonism and together with verbal fluency would be a useful test to support PSP diagnosis."
"27318613","French consensus procedure for assessing cognitive function in Parkinson's disease.","INTRODUCTION: One of the objectives of the French expert centers for Parkinson's disease (NS-Park) network was to determine a consensus procedure for assessing cognitive function in patients with Parkinson's. This article presents this procedure and briefly describes the selected tests.METHODS: A group of 13 experts used the Delphi method for consensus building to define the overall structure and components of the assessment procedure. For inclusion in the battery, tests had to be validated in the French language, require little motor participation, have normative data and be recognized by the international community. Experimental tasks and tests requiring specific devices were excluded.RESULTS: Two possibilities were identified, depending on whether an abbreviated or comprehensive assessment of cognitive function was necessary. For an abbreviated assessment, the experts recommended the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as a screening test for cognitive impairment or dementia. For a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, the experts recommended assessing global efficiency plus the five main cognitive domains (attention and working memory, executive function, episodic memory, visuospatial function and language) that may be impaired in Parkinson's disease, using two tests for each domain.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: A common procedure for assessing cognitive function is now available across the French network dedicated to Parkinson's disease, and is recommended for both research and clinical practice. It will also help to promote standardization of the neuropsychological assessment of Parkinson's disease."

The MoCA was administered twice approximately 3.5 years apart ( n = 139). Participants were classified as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or cognitively intact at follow-up based on multidisciplinary consensus. We excluded 33 participants who endorsed cognitive complaints at baseline. The MCI group ( n = 53) showed a significant decrease in MoCA scores ( M = -1.83, p &lt; .001, d = 0.64). When accounting for age and education, the MCI group showed a decline of 1.7 points, while cognitively intact participants remained stable. Using Reliable Change Indices established by cognitively intact group, 42% of MCI participants demonstrated a decline in MoCA scores. Results suggest that the MoCA can detect cognitive change in MCI over a 3.5-year period and preliminarily supports the utility of the MoCA as a repeatable brief cognitive screening measure."

Inactivity itself may also lead to important health consequences, especially in older patients. Essential tremor (ET) patients may have a variety of physical and cognitive problems that could detrimentally impact on level of physical activity. Yet, to our knowledge, there have been no studies of physical activity in these patients.METHODS: Self-reported physical activity was assessed using the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) in 100 ET cases (mean age 80.5years) enrolled in a clinical study. Additional clinical measures were the total tremor score, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) score and number of steps taken off of the straight line during tandem gait (a measure of balance).RESULTS: Lower PASE score was associated with older age, more tandem gait difficulty, higher total tremor score and lower MOCA score (all p&lt;0.05). In a linear regression model that included total tremor score, MOCA score, number of steps off of the straight line during tandem gait, and age, higher total tremor score (p=0.046) and more steps off of the straight line during tandem gait (p=0.014) were independently associated with reductions in physical activity.CONCLUSIONS: Several of the motor features of ET (tremor and imbalance) are independently associated with reductions in level of physical activity."

"27239512","Concordance of the Montreal cognitive assessment with standard neuropsychological measures.","INTRODUCTION: The concordance of the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) with more comprehensive neuropsychological measures remains unclear. This study examined the individual MoCA domains with more comprehensive and commonly used neuropsychological measures to determine the degree of overlap.METHODS: Data included individuals seen in an outpatient neurology clinic specializing in neurodegenerative disease who were administered the MoCA and also underwent neuropsychological assessment (n=471). A principal component analysis with varimax rotation was completed using the MoCA domain scores and comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation measures.RESULTS: Four factors emerged accounting for 55.6% of the variance: (1) visuospatial/executive functioning; (2) memory; (3) attention; and (4) language. The individual MoCA domain scores demonstrated high factor loadings with standard neuropsychological measures purported to measure similar cognitive constructs.DISCUSSION: These findings provide empirical validation for the MoCA domain classifications, lending further support for the use of the MoCA as a cognitive screen that reflects similar constructs as those measured by a comprehensive battery."

Ninety-five of 118 patients diagnosed with MCI were followed up for 1 year after the study ended, and their medical records were analyzed.RESULTS: The patients included 36 men (37.9%) and 59 women (62.1%). When the results from before the study began were compared with the results 1 year after the study ended, the overall average score according to the Korean-Montreal Cognitive Assessment (K-MOCA) showed a statistically significant increase, from 15.46<U+2009><U+2009>5.30 to 18.54<U+2009><U+2009>5.11, respectively. Both male and female patients recorded a significant increase in K-MOCA scores for all sections, including the visuospatial/executive section, the naming section, the attention section, the language section, the abstraction section, the delayed recall section, and the orientation section. Scores assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination for Dementia Screening (MMSE-DS) showed a statistically significant increase, from 21.84<U+2009><U+2009>3.59 before the study to 24.43<U+2009><U+2009>3.13 after the study, but decreased slightly to 23.04<U+2009><U+2009>3.36 at the 1-year follow-up. However, MMSE-DS scores measured before the study began increased significantly when compared with scores measured 1 year after the study ended.CONCLUSIONS: DGJYS improved the cognitive skills of patients diagnosed with MCI, and no adverse effects were observed. In the future, the efficacy of DGJYS must be objectively verified by using a randomized controlled trial."
"27180611","Neuropsychological screening tools in Italian HIV+ patients: a comparison of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE).","OBJECTIVE: Despite the progress in HIV treatments, mild forms of cognitive impairment still persist. Brief and sensitive screening tools are needed. We evaluated the accuracy of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) compared to the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) to detect cognitive impairment in HIV-infected participants.METHOD: HIV-infected patients were consecutively enrolled during routine outpatient visits at a single institution. The MoCA, the MMSE, and a comprehensive neuropsychological battery were administered. Patients were considered as affected by cognitive impairment if they showed decreased cognitive function in at least two ability domains based on age and education adjusted Italian normative cut-offs.RESULTS: Ninety-three HIV-infected participants (75% males, median age 47, all on antiretroviral therapy; 90% HIV-RNA &lt;50copies/mL, median CD4 644 cells/L) were enrolled. Thirteen participants (14%) were diagnosed as cognitively compromised via a comprehensive neuropsychological examination. The area under the curve of the adjusted MMSE and MoCA scores to detect cognitive impairment were .51 (95% CI=.31-.72, p=.877) and .70 (95% CI=.53-.86, p=.025), respectively. A MoCA score &lt;22 was able to predict the cognitive impairment with 62% of sensitivity and 76% of specificity.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that the prognostic performance of the MoCA to detect cognitive impairment among mildly impaired HIV-infected participants was only moderate. Further investigations are needed to identify optimal cognitive tests to screen HIV-infected individuals or to explore whether a combination of cognitive tests might represent a viable alternative to a single screening tool."
"27176479","Neuroimaging basis in the conversion of aMCI patients with APOE-e4 to AD: study protocol of a prospective diagnostic trial.","BACKGROUND: The e4 allele of the Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE-e4) is a potent genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is an intermediate state between normal cognitive aging and dementia, which is easy to convert to AD dementia. It is an urgent problem in the field of cognitive neuroscience to reveal the conversion of aMCI-e4 to AD. Based on our preliminary work, we will study the neuroimaging features in the special group of aMCI-e4 with multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging (structural MRI, resting state-fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging) longitudinally.DESIGN: In this study, 200 right-handed subjects who are diagnosed as aMCI with APOE-e4 will be recruited at the memory clinic of the Neurology Department, XuanWu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. All subjects will undergo the neuroimaging and neuropsychological evaluation at a 1year-interval for 3years. The primary outcome measures are 1) Microstructural alterations revealed with multimodal MRI scans including structure MRI (sMRI), resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); 2) neuropsychological evaluation, including the World Health Organization-University of California-LosAngeles Auditory Verbal Learning Test (WHO-UCLA AVLT), Addenbrook's cognitive examination-revised (ACE-R), mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR).DISCUSSION: This study is to find out the neuroimaging biomarker and the changing laws of the marker during the progress of aMCI-e4 to AD, and the final purpose is to provide scientific evidence for new prevention, diagnosis and treatment of AD.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study has been registered to ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02225964, https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ ) in August 24, 2014."
"27130624","Social Function and Cognitive Status: Results from a US Nationally Representative Survey of Older Adults.","BACKGROUND: An early sign of cognitive decline in older adults is often a disruption in social function, but our understanding of this association is limited.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether those screening positive for early stages of cognitive impairment have differences across multiple dimensions of social function and whether associations differ by gender.DESIGN: United States nationally representative cohort (2010), the National Social life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP).PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling adults aged 62-90years (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>3,310) with a response rate of 76.9%.MAIN MEASURES: Cognition was measured using a survey adaptation of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment categorized into three groups: normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia. We measured three domains of social relationships, each comprised of two scales: network structure (size and density), social resources (social support and social strain), and social engagement (community involvement and socializing). We used multiple linear regression to characterize the relationship of each social relationship measure to cognition.KEY RESULTS: Individuals screened as at risk for MCI and early dementia had smaller network sizes by 0.3 and 0.6 individuals (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001), and a 10% and 25% increase in network density (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001), respectively. For social resources, individuals at risk for MCI and dementia had 4% and 14% less social strain (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01), but only women had 3% and 6% less perceived social support (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.013), respectively. For social engagement, individuals screened positive for MCI and dementia had 8% and 19% less community involvement (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01), but only men had 8% and 13% increased social involvement with neighbors and family members (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001), respectively.CONCLUSION: Changes in social functioning provide an early indication to screen for cognitive loss. Recognition that early cognitive loss is associated with differences in social function can guide counseling efforts and help identify social vulnerabilities to ease the transition to overt dementia for both patients and caregivers."

"27102361","Curcumin and cognition: a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of community-dwelling older adults.","Curcumin therapy in animals has produced positive cognitive and behavioural outcomes; results of human trials, however, have been inconsistent. In this study, we report the results of a 12-month, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study that investigated the ability of a curcumin formulation to prevent cognitive decline in a population of community-dwelling older adults. Individuals (n 96) ingested either placebo or 1500 mg/d BiocurcumaxTM for 12 months. A battery of clinical and cognitive measures was administered at baseline and at the 6-month and 12-month follow-up assessments. A significant timetreatment group interaction was observed for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (repeated-measures analysis; timetreatment; F=385, P&lt;005). Subsequent analysis revealed that this association was driven by a decline in function of the placebo group at 6 months that was not observed in the curcumin treatment group. No differences were observed between the groups for all other clinical and cognitive measures. Our findings suggest that further longitudinal assessment is required to investigate changes in cognitive outcome measures, ideally in conjunction with biological markers of neurodegeneration."

The total score of NINDS-CSN 5-minutes protocol was derived from MoCA. Moderate-severe VCI was defined as neuropsychological impairment in<U+2009>=<U+2009>3 domains. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analyses were conducted to establish the optimal cutoff points and discriminatory properties of the MoCA and NINDS-CSN 5-minute protocol in detecting moderate-severe VCI.RESULTS: Four hundre patients were recruited at baseline. Of these, 291 received a formal neuropsychological assessment 1 year after stroke. 19% patients had moderate-severe VCI.

"27048925","Associations between the Brief Memory and Executive Test (BMET), Activities of Daily Living, and Quality of Life in Patients with Cerebral Small Vessel Disease.","OBJECTIVES: In addition to neuropsychological difficulties, patients with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) can have reduced activities of daily living and a poorer quality of life compared to healthy adults. The Brief Memory and Executive Test (BMET), is a cognitive screening tool designed to be sensitive to the neuropsychological profile of patients with SVD. While the BMET is sensitive to the cognitive consequences of SVD, it is unclear how well scores on this measure relate to functional outcomes. The aims of this study are to investigate the relationship between scores on the BMET and functional outcomes (activities of daily living and quality of life) in SVD, and to compare this with other commonly used cognitive screening tools.METHODS: This study included 184 participants with SVD (mean age=63.2; SD=9.9) and 299 healthy controls (mean age=62.4; SD=13.8) who were tested using the BMET, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Stroke Specific - Quality of Life Scale (SS-QoL), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and measures of both instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and basic activities of daily living (BADL).RESULTS: After controlling for covariates the scores on the BMET, but not the MoCA or MMSE, were significantly related to poorer IADL and quality of life in the SVD group. In addition to the BMET scores, symptoms of depression were found to be significant associated with functional outcome.CONCLUSION: These results support the clinical utility of using of the BMET, in combination with a standardized depression questionnaire, during the early assessment of patients with SVD."

The treatment group participated in training focused on diet, lifestyle, exercises, and emotional regulation adjustment; they also received six monthly courses of moxibustion (heating acupoints by burning the moxa of dried mugwort), each of which involved 10 daily 15-minute sessions focused on three targeted acupoints (one of which was specific to the constitutional type). Changes in the MoCA and in the score of each of the four constitutional types were the main outcomes assessed.RESULTS: Two participants dropped out of each group over the 6 months, leaving 38 in each group. Based on repeated measures analysis of variance, the total MoCA score, four of the six MoCA subscales scores (visual space and executive function, naming, attention and calculation, and delayed memory), and all four of the TCM constitution type scores showed significantly greater improvement over the 6 months in the treatment group than in the control group.CONCLUSION: This study shows that TCM interventions can improve both the cognitive functioning and the severity of symptoms considered in the TCM assessment of constitutional types among elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment and WML. Long-term follow-up studies that use blinded evaluation of the outcome are needed to determine whether or not constitution-specific TCM treatments can prevent the onset of dementia."

At its recommended cut-off (&lt;62/100), the Qmci had a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 87% for CI (MCI/dementia). Raising the cut-off to &lt;65 optimized sensitivity (94%), reducing specificity (80%). At &lt;26/30 the MoCA had better sensitivity (96%) but poor specificity (58%). A MoCA cut-off of &lt;24 provided the optimal balance. Median Qmci administration time was 4.5 (1.3) minutes compared with 9.5 (2.8) for the MoCA.CONCLUSIONS: Although both tests distinguish MCI from dementia, the Qmci is particularly accurate in separating MCI from normal cognition and has shorter administration times, suggesting it is more useful in busy hospital clinics. This study reaffirms the high sensitivity of the MoCA but suggests a lower cut-off (&lt;24) in this setting."

Retrospective cohort study of 265 LBD patients [Parkinson's disease (PD) without dementia (PDnD, N = 197), PD with dementia (PDD, N = 40), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, N = 28)] from an international consortium who completed both the MMSE and MoCA at baseline and 1-year follow-up (N = 153). Percentage of relative standard deviation (RSD%) at baseline was the measure of inter-individual variance, and estimation of change (Cohen's d) over time was calculated. RSD% for the MoCA (21 %) was greater than for the MMSE (13 %) (p = 0.03) in the whole group. This difference was significant only in PDnD (11 vs. 5 %, p &lt; 0.01), but not in PDD (30 vs. 19 %, p = 0.37) or DLB (15 vs. 14 %, p = 0.78). In contrast, the 1-year estimation of change did not differ between the two tests in any of the groups (Cohen's effect &lt;0.20 in each group). MMSE and MoCA are equal in measuring the rate of cognitive changes over time in LBD. However, in PDnD, the MoCA is a better measure of cognitive status as it lacks both ceiling and floor effects."

Although mood dysfunction is common in referrals to memory clinics, the influence of mood on the MoCA has to date been largely unexplored.METHOD: In this study, we examined the impact of mood dysfunction on the MoCA using a memory clinic sample of individuals with depressive symptoms who did not meet criteria for a neurodegenerative disease.RESULTS: Half of the group with depressive symptoms scored below the MoCA-suggested cutoff for cognitive impairment. As a group, they scored below healthy controls, but above individuals with Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. A MoCA subtask analysis revealed a pattern of executive/attentional dysfunction in those with depressive symptoms.CONCLUSIONS: This observed negative impact of depressive symptomatology on the MoCA has interpretative implications for its utility as a cognitive screening tool in a memory clinic setting."

Whether and how the pattern of spontaneous brain activity in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) differs in subjects with and without concomitant LI remains unclear.OBJECTIVE: To compare the pattern of spontaneous brain activity in MCI patients with versus those without LI using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI).METHODS: Forty-eight MCI patients, including 22 with LI [MCI-LI] and 26 without LI [MCI-no LI], and 28 cognitive normal subjects underwent rs-fMRI post-processed using regional homogeneity (ReHo) and the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) methods.RESULTS: Compared with cognitively normal subjects, the MCI-LI patients had decreased ReHo in the precuneus/cuneus (Pcu/CU) and insula; decreased ALFF in the Pcu/CU and frontal lobe; and increased ALFF and ReHo in the temporal lobe. While the MCI-no LI group had increased ReHo and ALFF in the bilateral hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, frontal lobe, and decreased ALFF and ReHo in the temporal lobe. Compared with the MCI-no LI patients, those with MCI-LI had decreased ALFF in the frontal lobe; decreased ReHo in the Pcu/CU and insula; and increased ALFF and ReHo in the temporal lobe (p<U+200A>&lt; <U+200A>0.05, AlphaSim corrected). In MCI-LI patients, the MOCA scores showed a relatively weak correlation with ALFF values in the medial frontal gyrus (r<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.432, p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.045) (of borderline significance after Bonferroni correction).CONCLUSIONS: The spontaneous brain activities in MCI-LI were distinct from MCI-no LI. The probable compensatory mechanism observed in MCI-no LI might be disrupted in MCI with LI due to vascular damage."

We then examined the additive effect of the TRS and brief cognitive tests to improve the diagnosis of CI.METHODS: The study was conducted in 2 primary health care centers in Singapore. A total of 1082 individuals (=60years old) were assessed for sociodemographic risk factors and their informants were administered the AD8; 309 individuals who agreed for further cognitive assessments completed the Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and a neuropsychological battery at a research center. Primary health care medical records were accessed for data on vascular risk factors.RESULTS: Of the 309 individuals who underwent neuropsychological evaluation, 4 were excluded due to missing medical data; 167 (54.8%) individuals had CI and 138 (45.2%) had No Cognitive Impairment (NCI). The  coefficients were standardized to calculate risk scores. CI was significantly predicted by age &gt;70years (odds ratio [OR] 5.99; score=3), diabetes (OR 3.36; score=2), stroke (OR 2.70; score=1), female gender (OR 2.02; score=1) and individual cognitive complaints (SCC) (OR 1.95; score=1). The TRS had an optimal cutoff of =3 and explained considerable variance in global cognitive composite Z-scores (R(2)=0.41, P&lt;.001). The MoCA explained substantial variance compared with the MMSE and AD8 (R(2) changes of 0.474, 0.422, and 0.157, P&lt;.001, respectively).CONCLUSION: The TRS is a reasonable measure to predict individuals at risk of CI. The addition of the MoCA, in persons with positive TRS scores, is a useful approach to improve the diagnosis of CI for at-risk patients attending primary health care."

We also demonstrated that the test was effective for screening for very mild vascular dementia (VaD) in the community. Herein, we examined the effectiveness of MoCA in the assessment of patients with VaD in an outpatient clinic. Forty-four patients with VaD (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences [NINDS-AIREN] criteria) and 58 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association [NINCDS-ADRDA] criteria) were compared with 67 non-demented control subjects. All were outpatients at the Tajiri Memory Clinic, Osaki-Tajiri, northern Japan. All underwent 1.5 Tesla MRI and ethyl cysteinate dimer (ECD) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) examinations. The SPECT images were used to classify the VaD patients into two subgroups, those with frontal hypoperfusion (F-VaD) and those without frontal hypoperfusion. The frontal hypoperfusion pattern was defined as the &quot;P2&quot; pattern of the Sliverman classification, with or without focal hypometabolism in other areas, based on the agreement of three neurologists who were blinded to the results of the neuropsychological examinations. Total scores and attention subscores on the MoCA were lower in the F-VaD group compared with other groups. Our results suggest that the MoCA attention subscale can detect VaD participants, particularly those with frontal hypoperfusion. "

However, the findings are inconsistent about the preference of older adults to over/underestimate the observed interval as well as the relationship between the time estimation and the participant's cognitive status. In this study, we used a verbal estimation task for the rotation time of a virtual building (40 seconds) to assess the explicit interval timing of participants. The performance of a cohort of 250 cognitively-healthy adults and 10 Alzheimer's patients was analyzed in relation to their age and cognitive scale, measured by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score. The participants' performances were evaluated based on three measurements: Coefficient of variation (CV) for measuring stability, Absolute Error (AE) for measuring accuracy and Directional Error (DE) for measuring the degree of over/under-estimation. A significant difference was observed between the participants who overestimated the interval and those who underestimated it in terms of age, cognitive status and Absolute Error. We also found a significant effect of time estimation, with underestimation by cognitively healthy participants to mild over-estimation by 70+ year old and low-MoCA (MoCA score &lt;; 26) participants as well as severe overestimation by Alzheimer's disease patients. The result of regression analysis for predicting MoCA score based on the dependent variables (AE, DE and CV) support the superiority of Directional Error to Absolute Error and Coefficient of Variation that are commonly used in the time perception studies.

We compared total scores and scores from each cognitive domain of MoCA between patients with and without HAND. We also examined the utility of subsets of the full test using a few selective domains. The diagnostic accuracies of MoCA and subset composition were evaluated.RESULTS: The total scores of MoCA (P&lt;0.001) and scores from Trail Making Test-B (P=0.020), attention domain (P=0.005), and immediate (P=0.003) and delayed recall (P=0.002) differed between patients with and without HAND. A subset composed of Trail Making Test-B, rescored serial subtraction, and immediate/delayed recall showed a 69.2% accuracy.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the MoCA and its subsets alone are not sufficient in screening for HAND. Further studies will be needed to develop a simpler and easier screening tool for HAND based on this study."

Patients underwent whole-brain CTPI within 1week of TIA to detect cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean transit time (MTT) and time to peak (TTP) in the ischemic region. Based on cognitive function assessment 4weeks after TIA, using the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and mini mental state examination, the patients were divided into control and VCI groups. CTPI parameters and other clinical data were compared between groups, and Spearman's correlation analysis used to identify associations between cognitive scores and CTPI parameters in the VCI group. 50 patients (25 per group; aged 55-72years) were included. Patient age, gender, smoking status, alcohol consumption, educational level, time from TIA onset to admission, time from TIA onset to CTPI, and prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation and hyperhomocysteinemia did not differ between groups. Both groups showed TTP and MTT prolongation, CBF reduction, but no change in CBV in the ischemic region; these changes were significantly larger in the VCI group (P&lt;0.05). MTT correlated negatively with MoCA score (r=-0.51, P=0.009). CTPI could facilitate early diagnosis of VCI in patients with anterior circulation TIA. "

The MoCA was &quot;suggested&quot; as a screening tool for cognitive impairment. The major challenge in the assessment of cognition in Huntington's disease is the lack of a formal definition of dementia and/or mild cognitive impairment in this disease. The committee concluded that there is a need to further validate currently available cognitive scales in Huntington's disease, but that it is premature to recommend the development of new scales.

The influence of hypertension as modifiable risk factor in the evolution of cognitive impairment is emphasized in numerous investigations. Almost all the proposed in research literature data were obtained from the investigation of old patients group, who had high indexes of blood pressure and stroke histories. Therefore, we think that it is very impotent to detect the slight and moderate cognitive impairment of hypertensive patients of working age until the expressed clinical signs appear. Objective - determine the age and hypertension duration influence on the evolution of cognitive impairments in patients with essential hypertension of the second stage. There were examined 102 patients with essential hypertension of the second stage, which had not any attendant illnesses. Their average years were about 49,840,83 average. Disease duration was approximately 8,780,60. According to the purpose of examination all patients were divided by age and disease duration into 3 groups. To study cognitive impairment used a number of neuropsychological tests. Analyzing the MoCA test data of examined patients it should be noted a tendency to decreasing of cognitive function indexes with age increasing. Thus, the patients of the first group have no cognitive impairment. But authentic lowering of MoCA test results may be noted in the patients group of 56 years and higher, up to 6,1% in comparison with the patients under 45 years. The indexes of MoCA test in the group of patients with arterial hypertension duration more than 10 years were authentically lower comparing with the group of patients with disease duration up to 5 years and patients with arterial hypertension duration of 5 to 10 years in 9,9% and in 4,9% accordantly. We have found that with increasing duration of the disease and age the working age patients with essential hypertension of the second stage, significant increase in cognitive impairment was observed.

During the test phase, they were asked to recall the sequence in which landmarks were encountered (Landmark Sequence Task), the sequence of turns (Direction Sequence Task), the direction of turn at each landmark (Landmark Direction Task), and to identify the learned routes from a map perspective (Perspective Taking Task). Comparing the young participant group with the older group that scored high on the MoCA, we found effects of typical aging in learning performance and in the Direction Sequence Task. Comparing the two older groups, we found effects of early signs of atypical aging in the Landmark Direction and the Perspective Taking Tasks.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) was defined by a fall=20/10mmHg systolic/diastolic pressure. Participants were classified into one of 3 groups: 1) subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), 2) mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 3) dementia. Neuropsychological tests were analyzed for patients with and without OH.RESULTS: One hundred and twenty participants were included, of which 16 (13%) were classified as SCI, 42 (35%) as MCI, and 63 (52%) with dementia. Prevalence of OH was 0% for the SCI group, 26% (n=11) for the MCI group, and 38% (n=24) for the dementia group. Age, sex, education, and brief cognitive test scores (MMSE &amp; MoCA) were not different between groups with or without OH. In the MCI group, OH was associated with lower cognitive performance in several executive functions tests: visual working memory (p&lt;0.001), processing speed (p=0.006), Stroop flexibility (p=0.030) and Trail-Making Test part B (p=0.024). There was no difference in episodic memory performance. OH was associated with a diagnosis of hypertension and the use of antihypertensive medication. No differences were observed in vascular brain injury between groups with and without OH.CONCLUSIONS: This study found that orthostatic hypotension prevalence is correlated to severity of cognitive deficits in a Memory Clinic. In MCI, OH is associated with lower performance in executive functions. OH could represent an under-recognized correlate of cognitive performance."

"29026292","The effects of holistic health group interventions on improving the cognitive ability of persons with mild cognitive impairment: a randomized controlled trial.","PURPOSE: Persons with mild cognitive impairment (PwMCI) are at a higher risk of developing dementia than those without cognitive impairment. This research study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a holistic health group intervention, which is based on the holistic brain health approach as well as an Eastern approach to health care, on improving the cognitive ability of Chinese PwMCI.RESEARCH METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), 38 Chinese PwMCI were randomly assigned to either a 10-session holistic health intervention group or the control group. The holistic health treatment group attempted to promote the acceptance of their illness, enhance memory and coping skills, develop a positive lifestyle, maintain positive emotions, and facilitate emotional support among participants. The 10-session holistic health group intervention was structured, with each session conducted once per week and ~90 minutes in length. Control group patients and their family caregivers received standardized basic educational materials that provided basic information on cognitive decline for them to read at home. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test was used to assess the cognitive ability of PwMCI in the pre- and posttreatment periods by a research assistant who was blind to the group assignment of the participants.CONCLUSION: This present RCT provides evidence to support the feasibility and effectiveness of the holistic health group intervention in improving the cognitive and short-term memory abilities of PwMCI."

"29016605","Cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients: Implementation of cut-off values for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)-test for feasible screening.","OBJECTIVE: Reliable identification of cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients is of utmost importance, as it is associated with poor outcomes including dialysis withdrawal and death. High prevalence of cognitive impairment has been demonstrated in several studies using brief screening instruments or neuropsychological test batteries. However, the relevance of cognitive impairment as well as the accuracy of screening procedures have never been studied in this patient population.METHODS: 151 chronic hemodialysis patients (mean age 65.78  14.88 years, 73,5% male) underwent cognitive testing under standardized conditions by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and, in a second step, the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR), an international standard to measure the severity of dementia. For calculating MoCA cut-off values on the basis of the CDR global score, receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis and c-statistic were applied.RESULTS: 49.0% of patients were categorized as 0.5 in the CDR global with memory being the predominantly affected domain (47.7% of patients scored = 0.5). Youden's Index led to a threshold of 23.5 points for the MoCA test for optimal differentiation between cognitively normal (CDR global &lt; 0.5) and impaired patients (CDR global = 0.5) based on a sensitivity of approximately 99% and a specificity of approximately 74%.CONCLUSION: Interference of cognitive impairment with patients' independence and daily life was shown using the CDR for the first time in hemodialysis patients. A MoCA score of 23.5 points turned out as optimal threshold to differentiate between patients with and without functional impairment in the CDR, thereby paving the way for implementation of the MoCA test as a quick and thus highly feasible screening instrument for periodic testing in clinical routine."
"28991661","Behavioral and affective features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients.","Evaluating the cognitive and behavioral features in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients is important for therapy and care. Fifty-seven ALS, 5 ALS with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (ALS-FTD), 12 FTD patients, and 35 control subjects were evaluated by 10 different tests for cognitive and behavioral (mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Hasegawa dementia rating scale - revised (HDS-R), frontal assessment battery (FAB), Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), ALS-frontotemporal dementia-Questionnaire (ALS-FTD-Q), and anosognosia scale), affective (depression, apathy, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD)), and activities of daily living (ADL) assessments. The motor functions of ALS patients were evaluated by ALS functional rating scale - revised (ALSFRS-R) and modified Norris scale. ALS-FTD-Q scores showed intermediate behavioral disturbances of ALS patients between ALS-FTD and FTD patients and control subjects, but FAB, MoCA, and anosognosia scales did not. Both FAB and MoCA scores were significantly correlated with MMSE and HDS-R in ALS patients, but ALS-FTD-Q was not. ALS-FTD-Q score was significantly correlated with ALSFRS-R, apathy, BPSD, and ADL scores in ALS patients. Thus, in ALS patients, both FAB and MoCA tests were useful to assess frontal cognitive impairments, while ALS-FTD-Q was useful to detect mild behavioral and affective disturbances."
"28969462","Low Sensitivity of the Mini-Mental State Examination for Cognitive Assessment of Brazilian Patients With Parkinson Disease.","INTRODUCTION: Recent publications have highlighted the low sensitivity of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for the cognitive assessment of patients with Parkinson disease (PD). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), otherwise, has shown greater sensitivity when compared to the MMSE. Based on this, we have searched for the cognitive impairment measurable by the MoCA and the functional performance on activities of daily living in a sample of Brazilian patients with PD and normal MMSE. We hypothesized that the low sensitivity of the MMSE, already shown by other authors, could be replicated in a low-income country.OBJECTIVE: To describe the performance on the MoCA and the dependence on third parties for activities of daily living in a sample of Brazilian patients with PD and normal MMSE.METHODS: We evaluated 43 volunteers with PD and normal MMSE considering the Brazilian cutoffs. Cognitive performance was assessed through the MoCA and functional performance through a modified version of the Disability Assessment for Dementia Scale.RESULTS: Despite normal score on the MMSE, considering the Brazilian cutoffs, 62.7% of the volunteers performed below the literature cutoff for the MoCA (26 points). Furthermore, 30.2% had dependence on third party for activities of daily living. By using a strict cutoff for the MMSE (26 points), 56.7% performed below the MoCA cutoff and 24.3% had dependence for activities of daily living.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the limitations of the MMSE for the cognitive screening of patients with PD in a low-income country."
"28963056","Hippocampus-dependent spatial learning is associated with higher global cognition among healthy older adults.","Cognitive deficits in normal aging have been associated with atrophy of the hippocampus. As such, methods to detect early dysfunction of the hippocampus have become valuable, if not indispensable, to early intervention. The hippocampus is critical for spatial memory and is among the first structures to atrophy with aging. Despite the presence of navigation deficits in aging, few studies have looked at the association between wayfinding ability, navigation strategies, general cognitive function, and hippocampal volume. In the current study we investigated whether better general cognitive function is associated with the use of hippocampal-dependent spatial strategies, better spatial memory, and increased hippocampal volume. We also investigated, within older adults, the effects of aging on spatial memory. Healthy older adults (N = 107) were tested on a virtual wayfinding task and a dual-solution navigation task that can be solved using either a hippocampal-dependent spatial strategy or a caudate nucleus-dependent response strategy. Participants were also administered the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a test that measures general cognition and is sensitive to dementia. A structural MRI was administered to a sub-set of participants (n = 49) and hippocampal volume was calculated using a Multiple Automatically Generated Templates (MAGeT) Brain algorithm. We found that age was negatively associated with wayfinding ability and hippocampal volume. On the wayfinding task, participants with higher MoCA scores found more target locations and travelled shorter distances. We also found a significant association between higher MoCA scores and spatial strategy use. MoCA scores, spatial memory ability, and spatial strategy use all positively correlated with a larger hippocampal volume. These results confirm that with age there is a decrease in spatial memory, which is consistent with decreased volume in the hippocampus with aging. Furthermore, better general cognitive function is associated with better wayfinding ability and increased use of hippocampal-dependent spatial strategies."
"28959202","A 58-Year Old Male with Cognitive Deteriorations Caused by Septum Pellucidum Cyst: A Case Report.","Dementia is known to be induced by vascular dementia and certain neurodegenerative diseases. The presenting features of disordered memory, intellect and personality often result in referral to a neurologist initially. Septum pellucidum cyst (SPC) is a rare clinical finding and defined as a cystic structure between the lateral ventricles. SPC induced memory disorder and dementia has been seldom reported in which the clinical features are atypical and can be misdiagnosed. The main difficulty is to establish a correlation between symptoms and the cyst. When indicated, the treatment is essentially surgical and the ideal operative technique is also a matter of debate. Here, we reported a 58-year-male Chinese patient who presented with memory impairment 1 year ago. Both the physical and laboratory examinations were performed to evaluate the general conditions of the patient. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was applied to observe SPC and the neighboring brain structures. Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were used to assess cognitive function. The results of the patient's laboratory examinations were normal. However, the patient exhibited severe sleeplessness along with cognitive deteriorations despite short-term (less than 2 weeks) use of benzodiazepines with regular dose. MRI fulfills the consensus criteria for clinical diagnosis of SPC. Furthermore, the results of MMSE and MoCA were showed mild cognitive impairment (MCI) before the treatment of SPC. After neuroendoscopic fenestration of SPC, the patient's syndromes were disappeared, and his cognitive function was improved. In conclusion, the patient's symptoms were due to a secondary lesion attributed to the cyst. Comprehensive clinical evaluation and MRI help diagnose SPC induced dementia."
"28956423","Influence of glucose metabolism on cognitive function of patients with acute small-artery occlusion.","The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of abnormal glucose metabolism on cognitive function of patients with acute small-arterial occlusion (SAO). The present study included 1,211 patients, with small-artery occlusion according to the Trial of Org 10172 in acute stroke treatment (TOAST) classification, admitted between March 2014 and December 2016 to The Second Hospital of Jiaxing. According to cognitive function, the patients were divided into a group of normal cognitive function, a mild cognitive impairment group (MCI group) and a dementia group. The patients were also divided into normal a blood sugar group, an impaired glucose regulation group (IGR group) and a diabetes mellitus (DM) group based on glucose metabolism. Cognitive functions of patients in the different glucose metabolism groups were compared based on Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). General data, medical history, neuropsychological assessment and haematological index of the patients in each group were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was used to study independent risk factors influencing cognitive impairment. When comparing the group of normal cognitive function with the MCI group, there were no statistical significant differences between the MMSEs scores of patients among the three groups, but the difference in MoCAs scores had statistical significance. Hypertension history, hyperhomocysteinemia (Hhcy) and sedentariness were independent risk factors for SAO patients with MCI. When comparing the group of normal cognitive function with the dementia group, there were statistically significant differences (P&lt;0.05) between the MMSE and MoCA scores of patients among the three groups. Abnormal glucose metabolism, old age, female, high blood pressure, Hhcy, family stroke history and sedentariness were independent risk factors for SAO patients with dementia. In conclusion, abnormal glucose metabolism impairing cognitive function is not an independent risk factor for SAO patients with MCI, but is an independent risk factor for SAO patients with dementia."
"28949427","Mild cognitive impairment in older adults with pre-dialysis patients with chronic kidney disease: Prevalence and association with physical function.","AIM: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a risk factor for declining cognitive and physical function. However, the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and its relationship with physical function is not clear. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the prevalence of MCI and the relationship between MCI and physical function among older adults with pre-dialysis CKD.METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 120 patients, aged = 65 years (mean age, 77.3 years), with pre-dialysis CKD but without probable dementia (Mini Mental State Examination &lt; 24). MCI was evaluated using the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J). For analysis, patients were classified into two cognitive function groups: normal (MoCA-J =26) and MCI (MoCA-J &lt;26). Physical, clinical, and biochemical parameters were compared between the groups. Logistic and linear regression analyses were used to evaluate the specific association between cognitive and physical function.RESULTS: Seventy-five patients (62.5%) patients belonged to the MCI group. Significant differences between the two groups were identified for gait speed, balance, age, and haemoglobin concentration. After adjustment for covariates, only gait speed was significantly associated with MCI (odds ratio, 0.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.009-0,411).CONCLUSION: The prevalence of MCI among older adults with pre-dialysis CKD was as high as 62.5%. The association between MCI and reduced gait speed supports the possible interaction between physical and cognitive functions and the need for early screening."

"28893250","Association between dietary patterns and cognitive function among 70-year-old Japanese elderly: a cross-sectional analysis of the SONIC study.","BACKGROUND: An increasing number of studies in Western countries have shown that healthy dietary patterns may have a protective effect against cognitive decline and dementia. However, information on this relationship among non-Western populations with different cultural settings is extremely limited. We aim to examine the relationship between dietary patterns and cognitive function among older Japanese people.METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 635 community-dwelling people aged 69-71years who participated in the prospective cohort study titled Septuagenarians, Octogenarians, Nonagenarians Investigation with Centenarians (SONIC). Diet was assessed over a one-month period with a validated, brief-type, self-administered diet history questionnaire. Dietary patterns from thirty-three predefined food groups [energy-adjusted food (g/d)] were extracted by factor analysis. Cognitive function was assessed using the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J). Multivariate regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between dietary patterns and cognitive function.RESULTS: Three dietary patterns were identified: the 'Plant foods and fish', 'Rice and miso soup', and 'Animal food' patterns. The 'Plant foods and fish' pattern, characterized by high intakes of green and other vegetables, soy products, seaweeds, mushrooms, potatoes, fruit, fish, and green tea, was significantly associated with a higher MoCA-J score [MoCA-J score per one-quartile increase in dietary pattern: =0.56 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.79), P for trend &lt;0.001]. This association was still evident after adjustment for potential confounding factors [=0.41 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.65), P for trend &lt;0.001]. In contrast, neither the 'Rice and miso soup' nor the 'Animal food' pattern was related to cognitive function. To confirm the possibility of reverse causation we also conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding 186 subjects who reported substantial changes in their diet for any reason, but the results did not change materially.CONCLUSION: This preliminary cross-sectional study suggests that a diet with high intakes of vegetables, soy products, fruit, and fish may have a beneficial effect on cognitive function in older Japanese people. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm this finding."
"28886902","Measuring stability of cognitive impairment in inpatients with schizophrenia with alternate forms of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment during acute hospitalization.","Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia. Measuring the stability of cognitive impairment is important for further understanding of this disorder. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has been demonstrated to be a brief and effective screening tool in detecting cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia. It has alternative versions designed for longitudinal settings. The current study retrospectively analyzed the total and subscores of two versions of the MoCA, administered to a group of inpatients with severe schizophrenia at admission and discharge, to measure their cognitive stability during hospitalization. The results revealed that the test-retest reliability coefficient of the MoCA had good reliability, suggesting the two alternative versions of the MoCA are reliable measurements for assessing cognitive impairment repeatedly in patients with schizophrenia. The paired-samples t-test showed that the overall cognitive impairment of patients measured by two forms of the MoCA remained stable during acute hospital stay and across symptom changes. Furthermore, the results showed that patients' cognitive stability was not related to their symptom/illness severity improvement, age, education, or length of stay."

All patients received a course of neurotrophic therapy consisting of 20 intravenous infusions of cerebrolysin (30 ml of cerebrolysin in 100 ml of isotonic sodium chloride solution). To assess the therapy efficacy, psychometric scales (CGI, MMSE, MoCA-test, <U+041C>DRS, FAB, Clock Drawing Test, BNT, Word Recall test, delayed reproduction of 10 words, naming digits in a direct and reverse order) were used at 0, 4, 10 and 26 weeks of the study. Antibodies to p75 neurotrophin receptor (NTR) were measured by ELISA in blood serum of 19 patients before cerebrolysin therapy and after 10 and 26 weeks of treatment.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The study showed that <U+0430>MCI patients had an increased level of antibodies against P75NTR that was significantly decreased after 5.5 month of cerebrolysin treatment. Therefore, it can be a potential biomarker of long-term therapeutic effect of cerebrolysin treatment in aMCI patients. The modified fragment 155-164 of P75 NTR determined in the serum of patients can be an effective indicator for monitoring and predicting the efficacy of long-term neurotrophic therapy."

Relations between the receptive vocabulary and cognitive functioning, and the manifestation of differences between populations of elderly people based on the primary disease is in the focus of this study.AIM: To examine receptive vocabulary and cognition of elderly people with: verified stroke, dementia, verified stroke and dementia, and without the manifested brain disease.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The sample consisted of 120 participants older than 65 years, living in an institution. A total of 26 variables was analyzed and classified into three groups: case history/anamnestic, receptive vocabulary assessment, and cognitive assessments. The interview with social workers, nurses and caregivers, as well as medical files were used to determine the anamnestic data. A Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA) was used for the assessment of cognition. In order to estimate the receptive vocabulary, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test was used.RESULTS: Mean raw score of receptive vocabulary is 161.58 (+-21:58 points). The best results for cognitive assessment subjects achieved on subscales of orientation, naming, serial subtraction, and delayed recall. Discriminative analysis showed the significant difference in the development of receptive vocabulary and cognitive functioning in relation to the primary disease of elderly people. The biggest difference was between subjects without manifested brain disease (centroid = 1.900) and subjects with dementia (centroid = -1754).CONCLUSION: There is a significant difference between elderly with stroke; dementia; stroke and dementia, and elderly people without manifested disease of the brain in the domain of receptive vocabulary and cognitive functioning. Variables of serial subtraction, standardized test results of receptive vocabulary, delayed recall, abstraction, orientation and vigilance successfully discriminate studied groups."

Scans were performed on all subjects on a 3.0T MR scanner to obtain brain structural magnetic resonance images. Images were preprocessed using the VBM8 tool from SPM8 software package on the Matlab R2008a platform, and data were then analyzed using the SPM statistical software package to compare the differences of grey matter volume and white matter density between groups, and to evaluate the brain structural changes corresponding to the overall cognitive function.RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the PD-NC group suffered from grey matter atrophy, mainly found in the prefrontal lobe, limbic lobe and left temporal gyrus. The PD-MCI group suffered from grey matter atrophy found in the frontal lobe, limbic lobe, basal ganglia and cerebellum. Compared to the PD-NC group, the PD-MCI group suffered from grey matter atrophy found in the left-side middle temporal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus and frontal lobe. The grey matter regions correlated with MMSE score (mainly memory related) including the right cingulate gyrus and the limbic lobe. The grey matter regions correlated with MoCA score (mainly non-memory related) including the frontal lobe, basal ganglia, parahippocampal gyrus, occipital lobe and the cerebellum. Additionally, overall cognitive function in non-dementia PD was mainly located in the frontal and limbic system, and was dominated by subcortical atrophy.CONCLUSION: Structural changes in PD-MCI patients are associated with overall cognitive function, and the atrophic areas are mainly located in the frontal and limbic system, and are dominated by subcortical atrophy. Moreover, atrophy of limbic lobes is associated with impaired memory, whereas frontal lobe atrophy is associated with executive dysfunction. In addition, the subtle brain structure of the PD early cognitive impairment stage and PD-MCI stage can be detected via VBM technology, and thus, local brain atrophy may be a neuroimaging marker for the early diagnosis of PD-MCI."
"28807493","Homocysteine and cognitive function in Parkinson's disease.","INTRODUCTION: Increased plasma homocysteine (HC) is a risk factor for dementia in the general population. Levodopa therapy causes increased plasma HC, but it remains unclear whether elevated plasma HC is associated with cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD).METHODS: The study population includes all participants in the Pacific Northwest Udall Center (PANUC) Clinical cohort at the time of the study, consisting of 294 individuals with PD who had a standardized neuropsychological assessment and plasma collection for HC measurement. We tested the hypothesis that elevated plasma HC is inversely related to cognitive function in patients with PD.RESULTS: As expected, plasma HC was positively associated with age, disease duration, disease severity, and levodopa usage, while cognitive function was associated with age, education, gender, and APOE genotype, so subsequent analyses controlled for these covariates. When plasma HC was dichotomized as normal (&lt;14mol/L) or elevated (=14mol/L), subjects with hyper-homocysteinemia had lower scores on Digit Symbol (p=0.031), Hopkins Verbal Learning Task (HVLT) Delayed Recall (p=0.004), and semantic verbal fluency (p=0.049). When examined as a continuous variable, plasma HC was inversely associated with HVLT Delayed Recall (p=0.009)) and semantic verbal fluency (p=0.004), but was not significantly related to Digit symbol, Trail-making test, Judgment of Line Orientation, phonemic verbal fluency, MMSE, or MOCA. When analysis was restricted to non-demented subjects (n=231), the findings were unchanged.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that plasma HC is significantly associated with some aspects of cognitive function in PD, and may represent a treatable risk factor for cognitive decline in PD."

Despite the lack of available treatment modalities, screening for NCI is recommended. In the UMC Utrecht, yearly NCI screening is done using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) tool and the HIV Dementia Scale (HDS). The aim of this study was to evaluate this screening protocol in relation to clinical outcomes and management. A retrospective cohort study was performed in suppressed adult HIV+ patients. Apart from the MoCa and the HDS, the Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation-Participation (USER-P) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were performed. Patients scoring below average on cognitive screening tests or with subjective cognitive complaints were further evaluated using a standardized protocol, including optimizing cART and checking for somatic disorders. In patients with cognitive complaints and participation restrictions, cognitive rehabilitation was proposed. Two hundred eighty-six patients were screened. The vast majority were MSM with an average age of 49 years. One hundred forty-four out of 286 patients (50%) had an abnormal test score and/or had subjective cognitive complaints. Restrictions in participation were present in 23% of patients. Six patients on Efavirenz switched their regimes, as this drug is known for its potential central nervous system (CNS) side effects. A depressive component was present in 58 patients (40%). Five patients had a clinical relevant laboratory abnormality. Moreover, six patients were referred for cognitive rehabilitation, which resulted in a 100% success rate in set goals in the five evaluable patients. Although the protocol was not fully adhered to in all patients, it did result in detectable underlying causes of NCI in 59% of patients, and 21% was referred for further treatment. Moreover, cognitive rehabilitation appears to be a very successful intervention for patients with NCI who experience subjective complaints and participation restrictions."
"28754516","Recall Tests Are Effective to Detect Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of 108 Diagnostic Studies.","BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prevalent symptom associated with the increased risk of dementia. There are many cognitive tests available for detection of MCI, and investigation of the diagnostic performance of the tests is deemed necessary.OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of different cognitive tests used for MCI detection.DATA SOURCES: A list of cognitive tests was identified in previous reviews and from online search engines. Literature searches were performed on each of the cognitive tests in MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO from the earliest available dates of individual databases to December 31, 2016. Google Scholar was used as a supplementary search tool.STUDY SELECTION: Studies that were used to assess the diagnostic performance of the cognitive tests were extracted with inclusion and exclusion criteria. Each test's performance was compared with the standard diagnostic criteria. Bivariate random effects models were used to summarize the test performance as a point estimate for sensitivity and specificity, and presented in a summary receiver operating characteristic curve. Reporting quality and risk of bias were evaluated.RESULTS: A total of 108 studies with 23,546 participants were selected to evaluate 9 cognitive tests for MCI detection. Most of the studies used the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (n=58) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (n=35). The combined diagnostic performance of the MMSE in MCI detection was 0.71 sensitivity [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66-0.75] and 0.74 specificity (95% CI: 0.70-0.78), and of the MoCA in MCI detection was 0.83 sensitivity (95% CI: 0.80-0.86) and 0.75 specificity (95% CI: 0.69-0.80). Among the 9 cognitive tests, recall tests showed the best diagnostic performance with 0.89 sensitivity (95% CI: 0.86-0.92) and 0.84 specificity (95% CI, 0.79-0.89). In subgroup analyses, long- or short-delay recall tests have shown better performance than immediate recall tests.CONCLUSIONS: Recall tests were shown to be the most effective test in MCI detection, especially for the population with symptoms of memory deterioration. They can be potentially used as the triage screening test for MCI in primary care setting. But when a patient shows cognitive impairments beyond memory deterioration, a more comprehensive test such as the MoCA should be used."
"28738338","Cognitive Impairment Is Reflected by an Increased Difference between Real and Imagined Timed Up and Go Test Performance.","BACKGROUND: Recent research suggests using an imaginary version of the Timed Up and Go test (TUG) for a first assessment of cognitive impairment. By using the time difference between a real (TUGr) and an imagined (TUGi) TUG task, the objective of this study was to examine the effect of cognitive impairment on motor imagery ability.METHODS: Fifty-two participants (mean age 69.3  4.0 years) with mild cognitive impairment or subjective cognitive impairment were included in this study. The time difference between the TUGr and the TUGi was used as the main outcome. The Trail Making Test part B (TMT B), the ratio between TMT A and TMT B, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) battery were the main independent variables.RESULTS: The difference between TUGr and TUGi performance time and the TMT B performance time increased with decreasing cognitive function (p &lt; 0.01). There was no relationship between TUGr and TUGi performance time and TMT B/A ratio. There were significant correlations between TUG time differences and the MoCA score (r = -0.489, p &lt; 0.01), the TMT B (r = 0.364, p &lt; 0.01), and the TMT B/A ratio (r = 0.377, p &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSION: The combination of TUGr and TUGi may have added value in assessing cognitive impairment, which is a possible pre-stage of dementia."

Individuals with CI and cognitively normal controls were administered the CoCoSc and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Validity of the CoCoSc was assessed based on the relationship with the MoCA using Pearson correlation. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to examine the ability of the CoCoSc to differentiate CI from controls.RESULTS: Fifty-nine individuals with CI and 101 controls were recruited. Seventy-five (46.9%) participants had =6 years of education. Performance on the CoCoSc differed between normal and CI groups in both low and high education subgroups. Total scores of the CoCoSc and MoCA were significantly correlated (r<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.71, p<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>0.001). The area under ROC was 0.78, p<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>0.001 for the CoCoSc total score in differentiating the CI group from the cognitively normal group. A cut-off of =30 on the CoCoSc was associated with a sensitivity of 0.78 and specificity of 0.69. The CoCoSc was well accepted by attendees of community social centers.CONCLUSION: The CoCoSc is a promising computerized cognitive screen for self-administration in community social centers. It is feasible for testing individuals with high or low education levels."
"28697562","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment: Normative Data from a Large Swedish Population-Based Cohort.","BACKGROUND: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has a high sensitivity for detecting cognitive dysfunction. Swedish normative data does not exist and international norms are often derived from populations where cognitive impairment has not been screened for and not been thoroughly assessed to exclude subjects with dementia or mild cognitive impairment.OBJECTIVE: To establish norms for MoCA and develop a regression-based norm calculator based on a large, well-examined cohort.METHODS: MoCA was administered on 860 randomly selected elderly people from a population-based cohort from the EPIC study. Cognitive dysfunction was screened for and further assessed at a memory clinic. After excluding cognitively impaired participants, normative data was derived from 758 people, aged 65-85.RESULTS: MoCA cut-offs (-1 to -2 standard deviations) for cognitive impairment ranged from &lt;25 to &lt;21 for the lowest educated and &lt;26 to &lt;24 for the highest educated, depending on age group. Significant predictors for MoCA score were age, sex and level of education.CONCLUSION: We present detailed normative MoCA data and cut-offs according to the DSM-5 criteria for cognitive impairment based on a large population-based cohort of elderly individuals, screened and thoroughly investigated to rule out cognitive impairment. Level of education, sex, and age should be taken in account when evaluating MoCA score, which is facilitated by our online regression-based calculator that provide percentile and z-score for a subject's MoCA score."

"28653212","Higher blood-brain barrier permeability is associated with higher white matter hyperintensities burden.","The pathogenesis of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) is incompletely understood but blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction may play a key role. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between BBB permeability and the severity of WMH burden. Consecutive participants without symptomatic stroke history presented for physical examination were recruited in this cross-sectional study and divided into three WMH burden groups according to total Fazekas scores. They received dynamic contrast-enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging to measure BBB permeability, and received Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). A total of 102 participants aged 49-90years (mean age of 69.82years) were enrolled (36 with low WMH burden, 35 with medium WMH burden, and 31 with high WMH burden). Multivariable linear regression analyses revealed that participants with higher WMH burden had significantly higher BBB leakage rate and area under the leakage curve in normal-appearing white matter, WMH, cortical gray matter, and deep gray matter (DGM) after adjustment for age, sex, and vascular risk factors. Scores on MMSE and MoCA decreased with increasing leakage rate in WMH and DGM after adjustment for age, sex, WMH burden, and education years. We found that higher BBB permeability is associated with higher WMH burden and cognitive decline. The compromised BBB integrity may be a critical contributor to the pathogenesis of WMH and part of a series of pathological processes that finally lead to cognitive impairment."

However, data from population-based studies in Asia are lacking. We report on the prevalence, risk factors and consequences of SVD from contemporary studies in three Asian countries using 3-Tesla MRI for the evaluation of SVD.METHODS: Clinical, cognitive and 3-Tesla brain MRI assessments were performed among participants of three studies from Singapore, Hong Kong and Korea. SVD markers include white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) using the modified Fazekas scale, lacunes and microbleeds. Cognition was assessed using the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Adjustments were made for age, sex and cardiovascular risk factors.RESULTS: A total of 1797 subjects were available for analysis (mean age: 70.16.3 years and 57% women). The prevalence of confluent WMH was 36.6%, lacunes, 24.6% and microbleeds, 26.9%. Presence of all three SVD markers showed a steeper increase with increasing age rising from 1.9% in the lowest to 46.2% in the highest 5-year age strata. The major risk factors for the increased severity of SVD markers were advancing age and hypertension. Moreover, increasing severity of SVD markers was independently associated with worse performance on MMSE and MoCA.CONCLUSION: Elderly Asians have a high burden of SVD which was associated with cognitive dysfunction. This suggests that SVD markers should be a potential target for treatment in clinical trials so as to delay progression of cerebrovascular disease and potentially cognitive decline."

"28578804","Human anterolateral entorhinal cortex volumes are associated with cognitive decline in aging prior to clinical diagnosis.","We investigated whether older adults without subjective memory complaints, but who present with cognitive decline in the laboratory, demonstrate atrophy in medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions associated with Alzheimer's disease. Forty community-dwelling older adults were categorized based on Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) performance. Total gray/white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and white matter hyperintensity load were quantified from whole-brain T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging scans, whereas hippocampal subfields and MTL cortical subregion volumes (CA1, dentate gyrus/CA2/3, subiculum, anterolateral and posteromedial entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices) were quantified using high-resolution T2-weighted scans. Cognitive status was evaluated using standard neuropsychological assessments. No significant differences were found in the whole-brain measures. However, MTL volumetry revealed that anterolateral entorhinal cortex (alERC) volume-the same region in which Alzheimer's pathology originates-was strongly associated with MoCA performance. This is the first study to demonstrate that alERC volume is related to cognitive decline in undiagnosed community-dwelling older adults."

From June 2014 to December 2015, in 138 patients with basal ganglia hemorrhage, we carried out the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in patients on the day before the operation, the day after the operation and 9 days after the operation. Thirty-two patients (blood vessel group) had cognitive dysfunction and 106 patients (control group) had VD. One hundred thirty-eight cases of healthy adult volunteers were treated in Henan Provincial People's Hospital and were selected in the same period as healthy controls. The expression levels of serum S100 in the three groups were tested through the ELISA method and the statistical analysis was carried out. In VD patients, the serum S100 levels of patients were significantly higher than VD and healthy control groups; differences were statistically significant (P&lt;0.05). However, there was no significant difference between those without VD after operation and the healthy control group (P&gt;0.05). The correlation analysis was carried out with serum S100 as an independent variable and mean arterial pressure, BMI, MMSE and MoCA scores as dependent variables. Our results suggest that S100 expression levels were negatively correlated to the MMSE score (rs=-4.19) and the difference was statistically significant (P&lt;0.05). The length of hospital stay of patients with basal ganglia hemorrhage associated with VD was significantly extended, with a mean of 23.42.8 days. The expression levels of S100 protein in the serum of patients with VD after basal ganglia hemorrhage was significantly increased and negatively correlated to the cognitive function of patients. Therefore, it can be used as a differential diagnosis indicator of VD after the basal ganglia hemorrhage and treatment target point of the VD."

Twenty-four NPC patients without treatment, and 35 NPC patients receiving radiotherapy underwent functional MRI scanning. Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) was performed to evaluate the cognitive status of all participants. FC between 10 predefined cerebellar seeds, which were demonstrated to be involved in different brain functional networks, and all brain voxels was obtained for each participant. Using a second-level two-sample t-test, three significantly different FCs between the two patient groups were found, including the connections between the left lobule VIII and the right medial frontal gyrus, the left lobule VIII and the right crus I, and the right lobule VIIb and the right fusiform gyrus. The altered cerebellar-cerebral FCs were also significantly correlated to the MoCA score, as well as the attention score, one of the seven subscores in MoCA. We suggested that the altered cerebellar-cerebral FCs may underlie the radiation-induced cognitive deficits in NPC patients, especially in the domain of attention. Furthermore, considering the functional networks in which the altered connections involved, the anticorrelation between the default network and dorsal attention network may be impaired, and the mediating function of the frontoparietal network to dorsal attention network may be disrupted. The significantly altered cerebellar-cerebral FC may serve as the potential biomarker in revealing the radiation-induced functional abnormalities and may help in the early intervention to the cognitive impairment."

Lactate plays multifunctional role in human brain energy metabolism and cognitive function. However, no direct evidence demonstrated the link between lactate and cognition in normal condition. In the present study, concentrations of lactate in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood were measured to investigate the association of lactate with cognitive ability, which was assessed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), in 99 male Chinese subjects. Correlation analyses revealed that serum lactate levels were negatively correlated with age, and CSF lactate levels were negatively correlated with MoCA scores after Box-Cox transformations. But no correlation was found between serum lactate levels and MoCA scores after Box-Cox transformations. In conclusion, the results indicate that CSF lactate levels were negatively correlated with MoCA scores in male Chinese subjects."

So far, the underlying pathogenesis remains unclear. Therefore, we examined the potential relationship between cognitive impairment and three different categories of risk factors with particular focus on arterial stiffness measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV). A total of 201 chronic hemodialysis patients underwent cognitive testing under standardized conditions using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Demographic data including cardiovascular risk factors, dialysis-associated factors as well as factors related to chronic kidney disease (CKD) were analyzed. To account for arterial stiffness, PWV was measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoried with an oscillometric device that records brachial blood pressure along with pulse waves. In our cohort, 60.2% of patients showed pathological MoCA test results indicating cognitive impairment. PWV was significantly associated with cognitive impairment apart from age, educational level, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. High prevalence of cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients was confirmed. For the first time, an association between cognitive impairment and arterial stiffness was detected in a larger cohort of hemodialysis patients. Concerning the underlying pathogenesis of cognitive impairment, current results revealed a potential involvement of arterial stiffness, which has to be further evaluated in future studies."

Nonetheless, in the Italian context, the most-diffused screening tools are still those originally devised to diagnose dementia. The present pilot study then aimed at investigating the potential and feasibility of a novel screening battery, the Cognitive Assessment for Stroke Patients (CASP), in a sample of Italian patients by comparing it to Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) tests. A total of 29 neurology patients took part in the study. Participants underwent a screening procedure including the administration of MMSE, MoCA, and CASP. Data analysis suggested that the scores of the Italian version of the CASP are relatively less affected by the presence of language difficulties-common sequelae of stroke and head traumas-with respect to MMSE and MoCA ones. Furthermore, CASP scores proved to be highly correlated with both MMSE and MoCA scores, showing good clinical potential. Finally, the outcomes of administered tests proved not to be influenced by etiology or gender, and CASP scores showed a diminishing trend related to patients' age and a positive association with patients' education."

One hundred and nine patients (mean age =68 years) with symptomatic lacunar infarction and confluent white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on MRI was recruited across six sites as part of the PRESERVE DTI substudy. After handling missing data, 3T-MRI scanning was available from five sites on five scanner models (Siemens and Philips), alongside neuropsychological and quality of life (QoL) assessments. FA median and MD peak height were extracted from DTI histogram analysis. Multiple linear regressions were performed, including normalized brain volume, WMH lesion load, and n lacunes as covariates, to investigate the association of FA and MD with cognition and QoL. DTI metrics from all white matter were significantly associated with global cognition (standardized  =0.268), mental flexibility ( =0.306), verbal fluency ( =0.376), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) ( =0.273). The magnitudes of these associations were comparable with those previously reported from single-centre studies found in a systematic literature review. In this multicentre study, we confirmed associations between DTI parameters and cognition, which were similar in strength to those found in previous single-centre studies. The present study supports the use of DTI metrics as biomarkers of disease progression in multicentre studies."
"28482634","Cross-Cultural Applicability of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA): A Systematic Review.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is widely used to screen for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). While there are many available versions, the cross-cultural validity of the assessment has not been explored sufficiently. We aimed to interrogate the validity of the MoCA in a cross-cultural context: in differentiating MCI from normal controls (NC); and identifying cut-offs and adjustments for age and education where possible. This review sourced a wide range of studies including case-control studies. In addition, we report findings for differentiating dementias from NC and MCI from dementias, however, these were not considered to be an appropriate use of the MoCA. The subject of the review assumes heterogeneity and therefore meta-analyses was not conducted. Quality ratings, forest plots of validated studies (sensitivity and specificity) with covariates (suggested cut-offs, age, education and country), and summary receiver operating characteristic curve are presented. The results showed a wide range in suggested cutoffs for MCI cross-culturally, with variability in levels of sensitivity and specificity ranging from low to high. Poor methodological rigor appears to have affected reported accuracy and validity of the MoCA. The review highlights the necessity for cross-cultural considerations when using the MoCA, and recognizing it as a screen and not a diagnostic tool. Appropriate cutoffs and point adjustments for education are suggested."

"28477681","Influence of diabetes mellitus on longitudinal atrophy and cognition in Parkinson's disease.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) on cognitive performance and longitudinal volumetric brain changes in a cohort of cognitively normal mild PD patients.METHODS: Prospective study of idiopathic PD subjects who underwent baseline and follow-up MRI imaging and neuropsychological assessments at 6month intervals for 3years. Subjects were classified based on the presence (PD-DM) or absence of DM (PD-No DM) at baseline. Volumetric analysis was performed using FreeSurfer 5.3 image analysis suite. Brain volume and cognition were compared and analyzed cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Analyses were corrected for intracranial volume.RESULTS: There were 65 PD-no DM and 12 PD-DM subjects at baseline with comparable global cognition at baseline. PD-DM subjects had lower cortical grey matter (GM), amygdala, frontal white matter and temporal white matter volumes and higher total white matter hyperintensity and periventricular hyperintensities. After mean follow-up of 29.08months, there were 51 PD-no DM and 11 PD-DM subjects. PD-DM subjects demonstrated greater decline in MMSE and MOCA scores compared to PD-No DM. PD-DM subjects had a higher rate of atrophy in the cortical WM, particularly in the parietal and occipital white matter.CONCLUSION: Mild PD patients with DM have lower GM and WM volumes at baseline and higher WMH volumes, despite comparable cognitive scores. Longitudinally, DM in PD results in greater rate of cognitive decline, associated with higher WM atrophy."
"28469597","Cognitive Dysfunction Is Associated with Greater Imbalance and Falls in Essential Tremor.","BACKGROUND: Essential tremor (ET) is not exclusively a tremor disorder; it is also associated with cognitive and gait dysfunction. However, a gap in knowledge is that the relationship between cognitive and gait dysfunction has not been studied in detail in ET. We examined the relationship between cognition and balance and falls in ET and hypothesized that cognitive dysfunction in ET patients would be associated with greater problems with balance and more falls.METHODS: ET cases were recruited into the Clinical-pathological Study of Cognition in ET. A comprehensive cognitive assessment was performed. This included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to measure global cognition, multiple motor-free tests comprehensively assessing performance in each cognitive domain, and an assignment of Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores. We collected data on the number of reported falls in the past year, and balance confidence was assessed using the 6-item Activities of Balance Confidence Scale. These cross-sectional analyses utilized baseline data.CONCLUSION: These data indicate that a correlate of poorer cognition in ET is greater number of falls and lower balance confidence. Cognition should enter the dialog with ET patients as an issue of clinical significance."
"28453482","Higher Peripheral TREM2 mRNA Levels Relate to Cognitive Deficits and Hippocampal Atrophy in Alzheimer's Disease and Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment.","BACKGROUND: Variants in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) are associated with increased Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. Recent studies have reported inconsistent peripheral TREM2 mRNA expression levels and relationship with cognitive scores in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Additionally, no study has examined the association of peripheral TREM2 levels with neuroimaging measures in AD and MCI.OBJECTIVE: To determine peripheral TREM2 mRNA levels in AD, amnestic MCI (aMCI) and healthy controls, and the association with cognitive performance and brain structural changes.METHODS: We measured peripheral TREM2 mRNA levels in 80 AD, 30 aMCI, and 86 healthy controls using real time polymerase chain reaction. TREM2 levels were correlated with various cognitive performance and brain volumes, correcting for APOE4 status.RESULTS: TREM2 mRNA levels were significantly higher in AD compared to controls and aMCI. Levels did not differ between aMCI and controls. Corrected for APOE4, higher TREM2 levels correlated with lower Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and episodic memory scores, and lower total grey matter and right hippocampal volumes. Whole-brain voxel-based morphometry analysis found negative association between TREM2 mRNA levels and grey matter volumes in temporal, parietal and frontal regions. AD subjects with MoCA scores =20 had higher TREM2 levels correlating with smaller total grey matter, left hippocampal and right hippocampal volumes.CONCLUSION: Peripheral TREM2 mRNA levels are higher in AD and are associated with AD-related cognitive deficits and hippocampal atrophy. Our findings suggest that TREM2 may be a potential non-invasive peripheral biomarker for AD diagnosis."

In a sample of 138 consecutive patients presenting with cognitive complaints, we report significant correlations between lower MoCA memory scores and smaller hippocampal volumes (r<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.36-0.41, p<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>0.001). We also report that the newly devised memory index score, designed to better capture encoding deficits than the standard delayed recall score, was not significantly better for predicting hippocampal volume. These initial results suggest that poor performance on the MoCA's memory section should prompt further evaluation for hippocampal atrophy."

The Q mci-TR also had higher accuracy than the MoCA in differentiating MCI from SMC, which became nonsignificant after adjustment ( P = .15). A similar pattern was shown for distinguishing MCI from dementia. Test reliability for the Q mci-TR was strong.CONCLUSION: The Q mci-TR is a reliable and useful screening tool for discriminating MCI from SMC and dementia in a Turkish population."

We selected 79 PD patients and 92 controls (CO) to perform neurologic and neuropsychological evaluation. Brain MRI was performed to evaluate the following scales: Global Cortical Atrophy (GCA), Fazekas, and medial temporal atrophy (MTA). The analysis revealed that both PD groups (amnestic and nonamnestic) showed worse performance on several tests when compared to CO. Memory, executive function, and attention impairment were more severe in amnestic PD-MCI group. Overall analysis of frequency of MRI visual scales by MCI subtype did not reveal any statistically significant result. Statistically significant inverse correlation was observed between GCA scale and Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), semantic verbal fluency, Stroop test, figure memory test, trail making test (TMT) B, and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). The MTA scale correlated with Stroop test and Fazekas scale with figure memory test, digit span, and Stroop test according to the subgroup evaluated.

The Mini-ACE score from the ACE-III showed the highest diagnostic capacity (area under the curve 0.939). Memory scores of the ACE-III and of the RUDAS showed a better diagnostic accuracy than those of the MMSE and of the MoCA. All tests, especially the ACE-III, conveyed a higher diagnostic accuracy in patients with full primary education than in the less educated group. Implementing normative data improved the diagnostic accuracy of the ACE-III but not that of the other tests.CONCLUSIONS: The ACE-III achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy.

Participants were evaluated with both the MoCA-S and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) to determine the discriminant validity of the MoCA-S.RESULTS: Mean age and years of schooling were 736 and 114 years, respectively, with no significant intergroup differences. The MoCA-S displayed good internal consistency (Cronbach's a: 0.772), high inter-rater reliability (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.846; P&lt;.01), and high intra-rater reliability (test-retest reliability coefficient: 0.922; P&lt;.001). The MoCA-S was found to be an effective and valid test for detecting aMCI (AUC0.903) and mild dementia (AUC0.957); its effectiveness for detecting naMCI was lower (AUC0.629). The optimal cut-off points for aMCI and mild dementia were&lt;21 and&lt;20, respectively, with sensitivity and specificity rates of 75% and 82% for aMCI and 90% and 86% for mild dementia. The level of education had a great impact on scores: as a result, 2 points were added for patients with less than 8 years of schooling and one point for patients with 8-12 years of schooling (MoCA-S1-2). The MoCA-S1-2 showed significantly greater discriminant validity than the MMSE for differentiating aMCI from dementia.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA-S1-2 is a short, easy-to-use, and useful test for diagnosing aMCI and mild dementia."

Capacity (understanding, appreciation, reasoning and expressing a choice) to consent to POLST or GOC has not been determined among Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. We sought to assess GOC PD decisional capacity for those with cognitive complaints but not dementia.METHODS: Fifty consecutive PD patients were recruited from the Movement Disorders Program. Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the MacArthur Competency Assessment Test (MacCAT) for GOC were administered.RESULTS: Mean MMSE and MOCA was 27.76 and 24.5 respectively. Twenty subjects had impaired executive function. MacCAT correlated with MoCA and MMSE (p&lt;0.001, 0.001) but despite impaired understanding, appreciation and reasoning among some subjects, all subjects expressed a choice.CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study demonstrates PD with cognitive concerns had a range in decisional capacity with lower MoCA and MMSE scores predicting impaired MacCAT subscores. Clinicians should be aware that cognitive complaints without dementia may impact capacity. Despite impairments in understanding, appreciation or reasoning, patients may still express a choice. Hence, a choice in this setting may not represent their true values and goals. GOC discussions require explicit determination of the domains of capacity. Discussions regarding GOC should occur early in the course of PD."

We retrospectively studied whether morning versus afternoon assessment might affect the classification of patients aged 70 or older as severe (SCI), mild (MCI), and no (NCI) cognitive impairment by the MoCA.METHODS: Morning (12 p.m. or earlier) versus afternoon (later than 12 p.m.) proportions of SCI (MoCA score &lt;20), MCI (MoCA score 25-20) and NCI (MoCA score =26) were compared in a cohort of patients aged =70, attending a rapid-access TIA/stroke clinic.RESULTS: Of 278 patients, 113 (40.6%) were tested in the morning and 165 (59.4%) in the afternoon. The proportion with SCI was greater in the afternoon than in the morning (10.9 vs. 1.8%, respectively, p = 0.004), with no difference in age, education, diagnosis, disability, or vascular risk factors.CONCLUSIONS: Time-of-day appears to affect cognitive performance of older patients after they undergo TIA and minor stroke.

PD participants were scanned while on their usual dopaminergic medication. Cognitive testing was performed at baseline, and after 18 months using the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) and Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) computerised batteries, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). We used statistical parametric mapping (SPM V.12) software to compare groups and investigate voxelwise correlations between FDG metabolism and cognitive score at baseline. Linear regression was used to evaluate how levels of cortical FDG metabolism were predictive of subsequent cognitive decline rated with the MMSE and MoCA.PD participants showed reduced glucose metabolism in the occipital and inferior parietal lobes relative to controls. Low performance on memory-based tasks was associated with reduced FDG metabolism in posterior parietal and temporal regions, while attentional performance was associated with more frontal deficits. Baseline parietal to cerebellum FDG metabolism ratios predicted MMSE (=0.38, p=0.001) and MoCA (=0.3, p=0.002) at 18 months controlling for baseline score.</AbstractText>: PD participants showed reduced glucose metabolism in the occipital and inferior parietal lobes relative to controls.

"28292203","Simple screening for neurocognitive impairment in routine HIV outpatient care: is it deliverable?","Routine screening for psychological and cognitive difficulties is recommended in BHIVA guidelines but screening questions are not specified and studies give varied recommendations. Our aim was to see if simple screening in the routine clinic could help better direct our referrals to psychology and highlight those patients requiring, and likely to benefit from, further assessment. We introduced brief questions to assess neurocognitive impairment (NCI) and mood into routine HIV visits, with an onward referral pathway for further investigation for those screening positive. Routine attendees to HIV outpatient care over 12 weeks completed brief screening for depression (PHQ-2) and anxiety (GAD-2) and answered three short questions to screen for possible neurocognitive impairment (NCI-3Q). Patients screening positive underwent further screening via our psychologists and/or referral for neuropsychometric testing. Patient demographics, HIV markers and treatment history were recorded. 97 HIV outpatients were screened; 44 (45%) initially screened positive for NCI and/or mood. 29/44 (66%) were referred for further screening and/or psychological assessment and 21/29 (72%) of those engaged. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS) were conducted on seven patients; four of these received full neuropsychometric testing. A detectable viral load was associated with positive neurocognitive screening. Rates of NCI and mood disorder among those who were tested were consistent with previous studies. The PHQ-2 and GAD-2 did detect mood problems; however, our results suggest the NCI-3Q questions alone are not good at detecting those with possible NCI. Screening for NCI remains practically difficult in the routine outpatient setting and this pilot supports the need for clearer guidelines on detecting HIV related NCI."

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between serum UA levels and freezing of gait (FOG) in PD. A total of 321 Chinese PD patients with fasting serum UA evaluated were included in the cross-sectional study. Demographics, clinical features, and therapeutic regimen were collected. The Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) III and Hoehn and Yahr (H and Y) stage were used to evaluate the severity of disease, and the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scales were used to assess the cognitive function. Patients with FOG showed lower proportion of male, longer disease duration, lower body mass index, lower concentrations of serum UA, higher total levodopa equivalent daily dosage, higher UPDRS III score, greater median H and Y stage, lower scores of FAB and MoCA, and higher frequencies of motor fluctuation, dyskinesia, falls, and festination compared to patients without FOG (P&lt;0.05). The binary logistic regression model indicated that high UPDRS III score (OR=1.049, P&lt;0.001), fluctuation (OR=2.677, P=0.035), dyskinesia (OR=6.294, P=0.003), festination (OR=3.948, P&lt;0.001), falls (OR=7.528, P&lt;0.001), and low serum UA levels (OR=0.990, P&lt;0.001) were associated with FOG.

Cognitive evaluation by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were performed before and 1 year after CEA or CAS. Cognitive changes were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, whereas the subscores of MoCA and MMSE were also compared.RESULTS: The MoCA score was significantly ameliorated from 21 to 23 at 1 year after CEA (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.003), but the MMSE score did not significantly change (24 to 25, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.56). Additionally, the MoCA score was improved 1 year after CAS (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.04), but it was unchanged in those who were treated medically (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.15). Regarding the analyses of subscores, patients who had CEA improved in the areas of executive and memory functions, whereas those with medical treatment only showed improvement in memory. CAS did not improve any subscores. There was no significant improvement in the subscores of the MMSE in patients with CEA, CAS, or medical treatment 1 year after treatment compared with before treatment.CONCLUSIONS: CEA or CAS may be significantly associated with cognitive improvement as evaluated by the MoCA. However, patients treated medically do not show improvement in cognitive performance."
"28205215","Multicenter Validation of an MMSE-MoCA Conversion Table.","BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence points to the superiority of the MoCA over the MMSE as a cognitive screening tool. To facilitate the transition from the MMSE to the MoCA in clinical and research settings, authors have developed MMSE-MoCA conversion tables. However, it is unknown whether a conversion table generated from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients would apply to patients with other dementia subtypes like vascular dementia or frontotemporal dementia. Furthermore, the reliability and accuracy of MMSE-MoCA conversion tables has not been properly evaluated.METHOD: We retrospectively examined the MMSE-MoCA relationship in a large multicenter sample gathered from 3 Memory Clinics in Quebec, Canada (1492 patients). We produced an MMSE-MoCA conversion table using the equi-percentile method with log-linear smoothing. We then cross-validated our conversion table with the ADNI dataset (1202 patients) and evaluated its accuracy for future predictions.RESULTS: The MMSE-MoCA conversion table is consistent with previously published tables and has an intra-class correlation of 0.633 with the ADNI sample. However, we found that the MMSE-MoCA relationship is significantly modified by diagnosis (P &lt; .01), with dementia subtypes associated with a dysexecutive syndrome showing a trend towards higher MMSE than other dementia syndromes for a given MoCA score. The large width of 95% confidence interval (CI) for a new prediction suggests questionable reliability for clinical use.CONCLUSION: In this study, we validated a conversion table between MMSE and MoCA using a large multicenter sample. Our results suggest caution in interpreting the tables in heterogeneous clinical populations, as the MMSE-MoCA relationship may be different across dementia subtypes."
"28199994","Association between Montreal Cognitive Assessment Sub-Item Scores and Corresponding Cognitive Test Performance in Patients with Frontotemporal Dementia and Related Disorders.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a brief screening test developed to detect patients with mild cognitive impairment, is used in clinical settings across North America [Nasreddine et al.: J Am Geriatr Soc 2005;53:695-699]. The MoCA has been demonstrated to be sensitive to cognitive deficits in frontotemporal dementias (FTD) and related disorders [Coleman et al.: Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord 2016;30:258-263]. Given attentional impairments in patients with FTD, whether and to what extent the abbreviated items on the MoCA may predict performance on corresponding assessments is not known. Testing and demographic data were extracted from a clinical database using a sample of 91 patients with FTD and related disorders. The relationship between MoCA items and corresponding neuropsychological tasks was assessed through McNemar tests and Spearman correlations. While some MoCA items such as letter fluency, orientation, and clock drawing were strongly correlated with the corresponding standard cognitive test, the MoCA trails were insensitive to impairment compared to the full Trail Making B Test (p = 0.01). In contrast, MoCA naming and delayed recall sub-items detected cognitive impairment more frequently than available comparison tests. The MoCA is a sensitive screening measure to detect impairment in patients with FTD and related disorders, but cognitive deficits specific to FTD result in differential performance on MoCA items compared to longer standard cognitive tests."

The study also compared two community-dwelling groups of aged participants with and without probable cognitive impairment, as discriminated by two cut-off points of adjusted MMSE score. All the comparisons were carried out according to ROC statistics. Optimal cutoff for a diagnosis of probable AD was a MoCA score<U+2009>=14. Optimal cutoff for the discrimination of probable cognitive impairment was a MoCA score<U+2009>=17 (associated to MMSE cutoff of 23.8). Results confirm the substantial discrepancy in cut-off points existing between Italian and other international validation studies, showing that Italian performance on MoCA seems to be globally lower than that in other Countries.

A total of 172 SVD patients participated in the study, and they were assigned to patients with no cognitive impairment (NCI group) and those with vascular cognitive impairment no dementia (VCIND group). In total, 105 people were recruited into the normal control group. Serum S100 protein level was detected by ELISA. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was employed for the predictive value of serum S100 in diagnosing SVD with cognitive dysfunction. Pearson correlation analysis was used to examine the association of S100 level with mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and the association of S100 levels with hypertension. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze risk factors of SVD. The serum S100 levels in the VCIND group were higher than those in the NCI and normal control groups. Logistic regression analysis revealed that a high serum S100 protein level, hypertension, and high low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) level were the independent risk factors for SVD. In addition, hypertension patients showed higher S100 levels than those with normal blood pressure and the normal control group, and there was a positive correlation between S100 level and blood pressure. The concentration of serum S100 level was related to impairment of cognition function of VCIND patients, therefore, early detection of serum S100 was of great value for diagnosis of SVD."

The aim of this study is to determine the utility and ecological validity of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) among older HIV+ adults. A total of 100 HIV+ older adults aged 50years or over completed a comprehensive neuromedical and neurocognitive battery, including the MoCA and several everyday functioning measures. The receiver operating characteristic curve indicates =26 as the optimal cut-off balancing sensitivity (84.2%) and specificity (55.8%) compared to &quot;gold standard&quot; impairment as measured on a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Higher MoCA total scores are significantly (p &lt; .01) associated with better performance in all individual cognitive domains except motor abilities, with the strongest association with executive functions (r=-0.49, p&lt;.01). Higher MoCA total scores are also significantly (p &lt;.01) associated with fewer instrumental activities of daily living declines (r=-0.28), fewer everyday cognitive symptoms (r=-0.25), and better clinician-rated functional status (i.e., Karnofsky scores; r=0.28); these associations remain when controlling for depressive symptoms. HIV+ individuals who are neurocognitively normal demonstrate medium-to-large effect size differences in their MoCA performance compared to those with asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (d=0.85) or syndromic HAND (mild neurocognitive disorder or HIV-associated dementia; d=0.78), while the latter two categories do not differ. Although limited by less than optimal specificity, the MoCA demonstrates good sensitivity and ecological validity, which lends support to its psychometric integrity as a brief cognitive screening tool among older HIV+ adults."
"28108207","Cognitive Impairment Is Very Common in Elderly Patients With Syncope and Unexplained Falls.","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of cognitive impairment (CI), including mild CI and dementia, in elderly patients with syncope and unexplained falls. In this population, we compared the use of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) with a cognitive screening test that assesses executive dysfunction typical of subcortical (vascular) CI, that is, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).DESIGN: Observational cohort study.SETTING: Outpatient fall and syncope clinic.PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients aged =65years with syncope and unexplained falls without loss of consciousness.MEASUREMENTS: Baseline characteristics, functional status, MMSE, MoCA, and magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain.MAIN OUTCOME: prevalence of CI, comparing the MMSE with the MoCA. CI was defined as an MMSE/MoCA score &lt;26.SECONDARY OUTCOMES: MMSE/MoCA overall and subdomain scores, Fazekas and medial temporal lobe atrophy scores.RESULTS: We included 200 patients, mean age 79.5 (standard deviation 6.6) years (Syncope Group: n= 101; Fall Group: n= 99). Prevalence of CI was 16.8% (MMSE) versus 60.4% (MoCA) in the Syncope Group (P&lt;.001) and 16.8% (MMSE) versus 56.6% (MoCA) in the Fall Group (P&lt;.001). Prevalence of CI did not differ between the Syncope Group and Fall Group with either method. Executive dysfunction was present in both groups.CONCLUSION: CI is as common in elderly patients with syncope as it is in patients with unexplained falls, with an overall prevalence of 58%. The MMSE fails as a screening instrument for CI in these patients, because it does not assess executive function. Therefore, we recommend the MoCA for cognitive screening in older patients with syncope and unexplained falls."

In this paper, we investigate if machine-learning classifiers offer the discriminative power for the diagnosis of AD based on postural control kinematics. We compared Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Multiple Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBNs), and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) on 72 participants (36 AD patients and 36 healthy subjects) exposed to seven increasingly difficult postural tasks. The decisional space was composed of 18 kinematic variables (adjusted for age, education, height, and weight), with or without neuropsychological evaluation (Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) score), top ranked in an error incremental analysis. Classification results were based on threefold cross validation of 50 independent and randomized runs sets: training (50%), test (40%), and validation (10%). Having a decisional space relying solely on postural kinematics, accuracy of AD diagnosis ranged from 71.7 to 86.1%. Adding the MoCA variable, the accuracy ranged between 91 and 96.6%. MLP classifier achieved top performance in both decisional spaces. Having comprehended the interdynamic interaction between postural stability and cognitive performance, our results endorse machine-learning models as a useful tool for computer-aided diagnosis of AD based on postural control kinematics."

As scoring the visuospatial/executive MoCA items involves subjective judgement, reliability is important. Analyzing data on these items from A Very Early Rehabilitation Trial (AVERT), we compared the original scoring of assessors ( n = 102) to blind scoring by a single, independent rater. In a sample of scoresheets from 1,119 participants, we found variable interrater reliability. The match between original assessors and the independent rater was the following: trail-making 97% (<U+03BA> = 0.94), cube copy 90% (<U+03BA> = 0.80), clock contour 92% (<U+03BA> = 0.49), clock numbers 89% (<U+03BA> = 0.67), and clock hands 72% (<U+03BA> = 0.46). For all items except clock contour, the independent rater was &quot;stricter&quot; than the original assessors. Discrepancies were typically errors in original scoring, rather than borderline differences in subjective judgement. In trials that include the MoCA, researchers should emphasize scoring rules to assessors and implement independent data checking, especially for clock hands, to maximize accuracy."

All participants received donepezil, and apolipoprotein E genotype was determined. The primary endpoint was general cognitive function: Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale, cognitive subscale, the Korean version of Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE), and the Korean version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA_K) were performed in-person every 6 months.RESULTS: Twenty-one participants (placebo 13, MHT 8) completed the trial (56.8%). Progression rates to dementia were 52.9% (9/17) in the placebo group and 44.4% (8/18) in the MHT group. Within-group analysis showed that all three tests significantly worsened during the trial in the placebo, but not the MHT groups. Analysis adjusted for e4 allele demonstrated that MHT significantly reduced deterioration of MoCA_K score, a sensitive tool for assessing global cognition in MCI (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.0261). Compared with the control group, both MoCA_K (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.043; mean difference, 3.85; 95% CI, -0.46 to 8.16) and K-MMSE (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.0319; mean difference, 3.26; 95% CI, 0.04-6.48) scores were significantly better at 24 months in the MHT group.CONCLUSIONS: Long-term MHT using percutaneous E2 gel and oral MP4 might attenuate cognitive decline in postmenopausal women with MCI."

Criterion validity of the two alternate versions in differentiating patients with Mild NCD was tested using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. One-month test-retest and inter-rater reliability were examined in 20 participants. Internal consistency of the alternate versions was measured by the Cronbach's a.RESULTS: 30 controls (age 73.4 [4.5] years, 60% female) and 30 patients (age 75.4 [5.5] years, 73% female) with Mild NCD were recruited. Both alternate versions significantly correlated with the original version (r = 0.79-0.87, p&lt;0.001). Mean differences of 0.17 and -0.40 points were found between the total scores of the alternate with the original versions with a consistent level of agreement observed throughout the range of cognitive abilities. Both alternate versions significantly differentiated patients with Mild NCD from healthy controls (area under ROC 0.922 and 0.724, p&lt;0.001) and showed good one-month test-retest reliability (intra-class correlation [ICC] = 0.92 and 0.82) and inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.99 and 0.87) and high internal consistency (Cronbach a = 0.79 and 0.75).CONCLUSION: The two alternate versions of the HK-MoCA are useful for Mild NCD screening."
"29790690","Validation of the Portuguese version of Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III in mild cognitive impairment and dementia.","BACKGROUND: Cognitive assessment is central to the diagnosis of cognitive impairment and dementia, and it should be performed in all patients in the early stages of the disease. Recently, the 3rd version of Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-III) has been developed in order to improve the previous versions.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the psychometric properties of the Portuguese version of ACE-III, namely: reliability and discriminative validity (sensitivity and specificity) in the identification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, in comparison to other neuropsychological screening tests, as well as to establish its concurrent and divergent validity.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study encompassed a sample of 90 participants distributed into 3 groups: Control (n = 30), MCI (n = 30) and Dementia (n = 30). In addition to ACE-III, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were also used.RESULTS: The reliability of ACE-III was very good (a = 0.914). ACE-III significantly differentiated the 3 groups. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves significantly favored ACE-III in comparison to another screening test - MoCA. ACE-III presented higher levels of sensitivity and specificity. Its total score correlated positively with the results on MoCA (<U+03C1> = 0.912; p &lt; 0.001) and negatively with a depression scale (<U+03C1> = -0.505; p &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The Portuguese version of ACE-III has very good reliability and high diagnostic capacity in the context of MCI and dementia. ACE-III also holds concurrent and divergent validity."

"29765301","The Additional Contribution of White Matter Hyperintensity Location to Post-stroke Cognitive Impairment: Insights From a Multiple-Lesion Symptom Mapping Study.","White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are common in acute ischemic stroke patients. Although WMH volume has been reported to influence post-stroke cognition, it is still not clear whether WMH location, independent of acute ischemic lesion (AIL) volume and location, contributes to cognitive impairment after stroke. Here, we proposed a multiple-lesion symptom mapping model that considers both the presence of WMH and AIL to measure the additional contribution of WMH locations to post-stroke cognitive impairment. Seventy-six first-ever stroke patients with AILs in the left hemisphere were examined by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at baseline and 1 year after stroke. The association between the location of AIL and WMH and global cognition was investigated by a multiple-lesion symptom mapping (MLSM) model based on support vector regression (SVR). To explore the relative merits of MLSM over the existing lesion-symptom mapping approaches with only AIL considered (mass-univariate VLSM and SVR-LSM), we measured the contribution of the significant AIL and/or WMH clusters from these models to post-stroke cognitive impairment. In addition, we compared the significant WMH locations identified by the optimal SVR-MLSM model for cognitive impairment at baseline and 1 year post stroke. The identified strategic locations of WMH significantly contributed to the prediction of MoCA at baseline (short-term) and 1 year (long-term) after stroke independent of the strategic locations of AIL. The significant clusters of WMH for short-term and long-term post-stroke cognitive impairment were mainly in the corpus callosum, corona radiata, and posterior thalamic radiation. We noted that in some regions, the AIL clusters that were significant for short-term outcome were no longer significant for long-term outcome, and interestingly more WMH clusters in these regions became significant for long-term outcome compared to short-term outcome. This indicated that there are some regions where local WMH burden has larger impact than AIL burden on the long-term post-stroke cognitive impairment. In consequence, SVR-MLSM was effective in identifying the WMH locations that have additional impact on post-stroke cognition on top of AIL locations. Such a method can also be applied to other lesion-behavior studies where multiple types of lesions may have potential contributions to a specific behavior."

This study aimed to investigate the joint contribution and strategic distribution patterns of multiple types of SVD imaging features in poststroke cognitive impairment.METHODS: We studied 145 first-ever ischaemic stroke patients with MRI and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) examined at baseline. The local burdens of acute ischaemic lesion (AIL), white matter hyperintensity, lacune, enlarged perivascular space and cross-sectional atrophy were quantified and entered into support vector regression (SVR) models to associate with the global and domain scores of MoCA. The SVR models were optimised with feature selection through 10-fold cross-validations. The contribution of SVD features to MoCA scores was measured by the prediction accuracy in the corresponding SVR model after optimisation.RESULTS: The combination of the neuroimaging features of SVD contributed much more to the MoCA deficits on top of AILs compared with individual SVD features, and the cognitive impact of different individual SVD features was generally similar. As identified by the optimal SVR models, the important SVD-affected regions were mainly located in the basal ganglia and white matter around it, although the specific regions varied for MoCA and its domains.CONCLUSIONS: Multiple types of SVD neuroimaging features jointly had a significant impact on global and domain cognitive functionings after stroke on top of AILs. The map of strategic cognitive-relevant regions of SVD features may help clinicians to understand their complementary impact on poststroke cognition."

Three groups of subjects aged 65 or above were recruited after written consent: normal older people recruited in elderly centres, people with mild NCD (neurocognitive disorder), and people with major NCD. The brief cognitive test, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA), were administered to the subjects. The performance of HKBC in differentiating subjects with major NCD, mild NCD, and normal older people were compared with the clinical diagnosis, as well as the MMSE and MoCA scores.RESULTS: In total, 359 subjects were recruited, with 99 normal controls, 132 subjects with major NCD, and 128 with mild NCD. The mean MMSE, MoCA, and HKBC scores showed significant differences among the 3 groups of subjects. In the receiving operating characteristic curve analysis of the HKBC in differentiating normal subjects from those with cognitive impairment (mild NCD + major NCD), the area under the curve was 0.955 with an optimal cut-off score of 21/22. The performances of MMSE and MoCA in differentiating normal from cognitively impaired subjects are slightly inferior to the HKBC.CONCLUSIONS: The HKBC is a brief instrument useful for screening cognitive impairment in older adults and is also useful in populations with low educational level."
"29614659","Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Cognitive Function are Positively Related Among Participants with Mild and Subjective Cognitive Impairment.","BACKGROUND: By 2030, about 74 million people will be diagnosed with dementia, and many more will experience subjective (SCI) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). As physical inactivity has been identified to be a strong modifiable risk factor for dementia, exercise and physical activity (PA) may be important parameters to predict the progression from MCI to dementia, but might also represent disease trajectory modifying strategies for SCI and MCI.OBJECTIVE: A better understanding of the relationship between activity, fitness, and cognitive function across the spectrum of MCI and SCI would provide an insight into the potential utility of PA and fitness as early markers, and treatment targets to prevent cognitive decline.METHODS: 121 participants were stratified into three groups, late MCI (LMCI), early MCI (EMCI), and SCI based on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Cognitive function assessments also included the Trail Making Test A+B, and a verbal fluency test. PA levels were evaluated with an interviewer-administered questionnaire (LAPAQ) and an activity monitor. An incremental exercise test was performed to estimate cardiorespiratory fitness and to determine exercise capacity relative to population normative data.RESULTS: ANCOVA revealed that LMCI subjects had the lowest PA levels (LAPAQ, p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.018; activity monitor, p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.041), and the lowest exercise capacity in relation to normative values (p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.041). Moreover, a modest correlation between MoCA and cardiorespiratory fitness (r<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.25; p<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>0.05) was found.CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that during the earliest stages of cognitive impairment PA and exercise capacity might present a marker for the risk of further cognitive decline. This finding warrants further investigation using longitudinal cohort studies."

To evaluate the added value of measuring motor and cognitive decline longitudinally versus cross-sectionally for predicting dementia.DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with 5 years of follow-up.SETTING: Clinic based at a university hospital in London, Ontario, Canada.PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling participants aged 65 and older free of dementia at baseline (N=154).MEASUREMENTS: We evaluated trajectories in participants' motor performance using gait velocity and cognitive performance using the MoCA test twice a year for 5 years. We ascertained incident dementia risk using Cox regression models and attributable risk analyses. Analyses were adjusted using a time-dependent covariate.RESULTS: Overall, 14.3% progressed to dementia. The risk of dementia was almost 7 times as great for those whose gait velocity declined (hazard ratio (HR)=6.89, 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.18-21.75, p=.001), more than 3 times as great for those with cognitive decline (HR=3.61, 95% CI=1.28-10.13, p=.01), and almost 8 times as great in those with combined gait velocity and cognitive decline (HR=7.83, 95% CI=2.10-29.24, p=.002), with an attributable risk of 105 per 1,000 person years. Slow gait at baseline alone failed to predict dementia (HR=1.16, 95% CI=0.39-3.46, p=.79).CONCLUSION: Motor decline, assessed according to serial measures of gait velocity, had a higher attributable risk for incident dementia than did cognitive decline. A decline over time of both gait velocity and cognition had the highest attributable risk. A single time-point assessment was not sufficient to detect individuals at high risk of dementia."

Fifty-six aMCI-multiple domains (amMCI), 32 aMCI-single domain (asMCI), and 33 naMCI patients were diagnosed according to extensive cognitive tests. All participants were administered by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the MoCA. Patients with amMCI performed worse than patients with asMCI, naMCI, and healthy controls on the MMSE and the MoCA (p&lt;<U+2009>0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) value for the MoCA when comparing the amMCI and control groups was 0.884 (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001), which was superior to that of the MMSE.

"29547067","Portable eyetracking-based assessment of memory decline.","INTRODUCTION: Preferential viewing of novel stimuli in the Visual Paired Comparison task has provided a useful marker of memory and medial temporal lobe function. We created a portable version of the VPC (P-VPC) and contrasted P-VPC metrics against the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in healthy adults, to assess the validity and reliability of the P-VPC as an indicator of memory function across age. A supplementary case series was conducted with individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias, to provide a preliminary illustration of the P-VPC's use as a measure in clinical populations.METHOD: Participants (n=207) were tested using the P-VPC. Individuals were familiarized with a set of objects, which were each presented alongside a novel object in the test phase. Novelty viewing scores were compared to MoCA scores to index concurrent validity. Item analyses were conducted as a test of internal reliability of the P-VPC. A complementary clinical case series was conducted with AD (n=4) and dementia (n=5) participants, who were tested using the P-VPC and further compared to healthy age-matched participants.RESULTS: Preferential viewing decreased with age in healthy participants, and was positively correlated with MoCA scores. Compared to the MoCA, P-VPC scores did not differ based on education and/or whether English was spoken as the native language. Item analyses revealed acceptable internal consistency. P-VPC viewing percentiles of healthy participants were modeled as a function of age, and illustrated that individuals of the clinical case series diagnosed with AD scored in below-average percentiles, while those with dementia did not score below-average.CONCLUSION: Good concurrent validity and acceptable internal reliability were observed, and P-VPC scores were not confounded by education or language experience. Low performance was observed in individuals with clinically diagnosed AD, suggesting that the P-VPC may be a potential tool for screening memory decline."

The scores obtained by the individuals in the ABCD were correlated to those obtained on the Lawton-IADL scale.RESULTS: Individuals with DS had significantly lower performance than cognitively normal adults and elderly as described in Brazilian studies. Due to the lack of similar studies in our country, we compared our results to those of elderly with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), verifying that the performance of the DS population is similar to that of AD patients, although the former presented better scores on episodic immediate memory tests. There was a significant positive correlation between the scores obtained in the Lawton-IADL and those on the constructs Mental State, Episodic Memory, Linguistic Comprehension and Total ABCD.CONCLUSION: The ABCD battery is a useful tool in the evaluation of adults and elderly with DS and the performance of individuals in this battery correlates with indices of functionality. This is a pioneer study in Brazil, and it points to the need for a better characterization of the linguistic abilities of individuals with DS, in order to allow the elaboration of strategies that stimulate their communicative abilities as to promote greater social insertion for this population."

The RS-fMRI data were analyzed with DPARSF and REST software. Regions with changed functional connectivity were determined by the seed-based voxelwise method and compared between groups. Correlation between the intensity of FC and the MoCA scores of PD group was analyzed.RESULTS: Parametric maps showed statistical increases in PCC functional connectivity in PD-MCI patients and decreases in PCC connectivity in PDD patients. The latter group of patients also showed evidence for increased connectivity between prefrontal cortices and posterior cerebellum. A significant positive correlation was found between the MoCA scores and the strength of PCC connectivity in the angular gyrus and posterior cerebellum and a negative correlation between MoCA scores and PCC connectivity in all other brain regions.CONCLUSION: When patients transition from PD-NCI to PD-MCI, there appears to be an increase in functional connectivity in the PCC, suggesting an expansion of the cortical network. Another new network (a compensatory prefrontal cortical-cerebellar loop) later develops during the transition from PD-MCI to PDD."
"29480192","Neuropsychiatric and Cognitive Subtypes among Community-Dwelling Older Persons and the Association with DSM-5 Mild Neurocognitive Disorder: Latent Class Analysis.","BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) have been shown to increase the risk of neurocognitive disorders (NCD), leading to the recently-published criteria of mild behavioral impairment (MBI) to identify pre-dementia using NPS alone. However, MBI drew concerns about over-diagnosing subclinical psychiatric disorders.OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the specificity of NPS in predicting NCD may be improved by considering NPS together with various domains of cognitive deficits. We tested this hypothesis by identifying subtypes based on the combination of NPS and cognitive deficits among community-dwelling older persons, and evaluating how the identified subtypes were associated with mild NCD.METHODS: Our participants were from a community-based cohort study. They completed assessments such as Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Those with possible cognitive impairment underwent further evaluations for mild NCD. Latent class analysis was conducted using GDS, GAI, and MoCA domains. Logistic regression was performed to investigate the association between the latent-classes and mild NCD.RESULTS: We included 825 participants, and identified four distinct subtypes: Subtype 1 (no NPS or cognitive deficits), Subtype 2 (NPS alone), Subtype 3 (cognitive deficits alone), and Subtype 4 (both NPS and cognitive deficits). Subtype 1 and 2 had low risk of prevalent mild NCD (OR 0.92- 1.00), while Subtype 3 conferred a moderate risk (OR 4.47- 4.85) and Subtype 4 had the highest risk (OR 7.95- 8.63).CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the benefits of combining NPS and cognitive deficits to predict those at highest risk of prevalent mild NCD. Our findings highlighted the relevance of subclinical psychiatric symptoms in predicting NCD, and indirectly supported the need for longer durations of NPS to improve its specificity."

We assessed the change in cognitive function during haemodialysis and associated risk factors.METHODS: All patients =50 years, on haemodialysis for =3 months, no dementia from 2 dialysis centres were selected. Cognition was assessed before and after a haemodialysis session using parallel versions of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) tool. Multiple regression was used to examine potential confounders.RESULTS: Eight-two patients completed both tests - median age 73 (52-91) years, 59% male, dialysis vintage 41 (3-88) months. Sixty-two (76%) had CI at baseline. Cognition declined over dialysis (MOCA 21  4.8 to 19.1  4.1, p&lt; 0.001) and domains affected were attention, language, abstraction and delayed recall. Age and dialysis vintage were independently associated with decline.CONCLUSION: Cognitive function declines over a haemodialysis session and this has significant clinical implications over health literacy, self-management and tasks like driving. More research is needed to find the cause for this decline in cognition."

Due to the absence of a concrete therapeutic approach to this pathophysiological process, in the last decades there has been an increasing interest in the use of nutraceuticals, especially those with antioxidant properties, which own strong neuroprotective potential, that may help to improve cognitive function and to delay the onset of dementia.We evaluated the effects of the treatment with a new nutraceutical preparation containing different molecules with potent antioxidant properties (AkP05, IzzeK) and placebo on a cohort of thirty-six hypertensive patients. At baseline, neuropsychological evaluation, arterial stiffness and biochemical parameters of the subjects were comparable. After 6months of treatment, there was a significant reduction of the augmentation index in the AkP05-treated group. Moreover, the measurement of cognitive function, evaluated with MoCA test and Word Match Testing, showed a significant improvement in patients receiving the active treatment. In addition, the group treated with nutraceutical reached a better Stroop test score, while subjects that received placebo did not showed any improvement. Finally, a positive relationship between SBP variation and the psychometric assessment with the EQ-VAS scale was observed only in the active treatment group.</AbstractText>: We evaluated the effects of the treatment with a new nutraceutical preparation containing different molecules with potent antioxidant properties (AkP05, IzzeK) and placebo on a cohort of thirty-six hypertensive patients.

"29439344","Low Accuracy of Brief Cognitive Tests in Tracking Longitudinal Cognitive Decline in an Asian Elderly Cohort.","BACKGROUND: Researchers have questioned the utility of brief cognitive tests such as the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in serial administration and suggested that brief cognitive tests may not accurately track changes in Global Cognition.OBJECTIVE: To examine the accuracy of longitudinal changes on brief cognitive tests in reflecting progression in Global Cognition measured using comprehensive neuropsychological assessments.METHODS: Two hundred and seven participants were assessed with the MMSE, MoCA, and a validated comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Global z-scores on the battery were derived and used to assess overall and significant (=0.5 standard deviation) decline on Global Cognition. Different patterns of decline on MMSE/MoCA were classified. Accuracy was examined using receiver operating characteristic curve, and sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values were reported.RESULTS: The overall ability of MMSE/MoCA change scores to discriminate participants who did and did not decline on Global Cognition was fair-to-moderate (AUC [95% CI]<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.71 [0.64-0.78] &amp; 0.73 [0.66-0.80] for overall decline; 0.78 [0.70-0.85] &amp; 0.80 [0.73-0.86] for significant decline, respectively). Changes in MMSE/MoCA had low accuracy in identifying significant Global Cognitive Decline (PPV<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.41 &amp; 0.46, respectively) but high accuracy in ruling out significant decline and identifying cognitively stable participants (NPV<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.89 &amp; 0.88, respectively).CONCLUSION: There is limited utility in brief cognitive tests for tracking cognitive decline. Instead, they should be used for identifying participants who remain cognitively stable on follow up. These results accentuate the importance of acknowledging the limitations of brief cognitive tests when assessing cognitive change."
"29430766","Normative data for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Memory Index Score (MoCA-MIS) in Brazil: Adjusting the nonlinear effects of education with fractional polynomials.","OBJECTIVE: To provide age-corrected and education-corrected norms for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Memory Index Score (MoCA-MIS) in Brazil.METHODS: Community-dwelling outpatients were enrolled if they had no history of neurologic or psychiatric diseases and were not taking any drugs with effects on the central nervous system. Dementia has been excluded with the Functional Activities Questionnaire. The final sample consisted of 597 cognitively healthy Brazilians aged 50 to 90years. To account for nonlinear relationships, we have used fractional polynomials that provide a flexible parameterization for continuous variables.RESULTS: According to the original proposed cutoff (=25 points), 87% of our sample would be considered impaired. Even using a more conservative suggestion (=22 points), 67% of our normative sample would be regarded as impaired. These data reinforce the need of adjusting cutoffs for schooling in populations with heterogeneous educational backgrounds. MoCA scores presented a nonlinear positive association with education tending to a plateau at higher levels (P&lt;0.001). On the other hand, MoCA-MIS scores presented a nonlinear negative relationship with age, with an accelerated pattern at higher age levels (P&lt;0.001).CONCLUSIONS: We presented normative data for the MoCA and the MoCA-MIS that will facilitate the use of the test in Brazil and, potentially, in other populations with substantial proportions of low-educated individuals. Moreover, we described a systematic approach for adjusting the effects of age and education using fractional polynomials and provided suggestions on how to account for the nonlinear relationship that is frequently encountered between demographic factors and measures of cognitive performance."
"29424560","Validation of Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Basic in a sample of elderly Egyptians with neurocognitive disorders.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Basic (MoCA-B) is a modified version of the MoCA that is especially suitable for use in elderly subjects with low education. The Authors translated the tool into Arabic and they aimed at validation of this tool in a sample of elderly Egyptians.METHODS: The study included 93 patients, 60years and older, fulfilling the DSM-5 criteria of Mild Neurocognitive Disorder (NCD) (39 patients) and Major Neurocognitive Disorder (54 patients) that were compared to 112 community dwelling elder subjects. All subjects were assessed using the MoCA-B, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) in addition to the required laboratory and radiological investigations.RESULTS: MoCA-B demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.915) and content validity in discrimination between normal and diseased subjects. It showed superior sensitivity and specificity when compared to MMSE in screening for Mild NCD (AUC MoCA-B = 0.988 versus MMSE = 0.939). The recommended cut-off was 21/22 with sensitivity of 92.5% and specificity of 98.2% for detecting Mild NCD and 16/17 with sensitivity of 90.7% and specificity of 97.4% for detecting Major NCD (dementia).CONCLUSION: The Arabic MoCA-B is a valid cognitive assessment tool in elderly Egyptian subjects."
"29355911","The Brain Health Assessment for Detecting and Diagnosing Neurocognitive Disorders.","OBJECTIVES: Brief cognitive screens lack the sensitivity to detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or support differential diagnoses. The objective of this study was to validate the 10-minute, tablet-based University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Brain Health Assessment (BHA) to overcome these limitations.DESIGN: Cross-sectional.SETTING: UCSF Memory and Aging Center.PARTICIPANTS: Older adults (N=347) (neurologically healthy controls (n=185), and individuals diagnosed with MCI (n=99), dementia (n=42), and as normal with concerns (n=21)).MEASUREMENTS: The BHA includes subtests of memory, executive function and speed, visuospatial skills, and language and an optional informant survey. Participants completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and criterion-standard neuropsychological tests. Standardized structural 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 145 participants.RESULTS: At a fixed 85% specificity rate, the BHA had 100% sensitivity to dementia and 84% to MCI; the MoCA had 75% sensitivity to dementia and 25% to MCI. The BHA had 83% sensitivity to MCI likely due to AD and 88% to MCI unlikely due to AD, and the MoCA had 58% sensitivity to MCI likely AD and 24% to MCI unlikely AD. The BHA subtests demonstrated moderate to high correlations with the criterion-standard tests from their respective cognitive domains. Memory test performance correlated with medial temporal lobe volumes; executive and speed with frontal, parietal, and basal ganglia volumes; and visuospatial with right parietal volumes.CONCLUSION: The BHA had excellent combined sensitivity and specificity to detect dementia and MCI, including MCI due to diverse etiologies. The subtests provide efficient, valid measures of neurocognition that are critical in making a differential diagnosis."

"29300426","Physical Frailty Is Associated with Longitudinal Decline in Global Cognitive Function in Non-Demented Older Adults: A Prospective Study.","OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between physical frailty and subsequent decline in global cognitive function in the non-demented elderly.DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective population-based study in a west Japanese suburban town, with two-year follow-up.PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwellers aged 65 and older without placement in long-term care, and not having a history of dementia, Parkinson's disease and depression at baseline, who participated in the cohort of the Sasaguri Genkimon Study and underwent follow-up assessments two years later (N = 1,045).MEASUREMENTS: Global cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Physical frailty was identified according to the following five components: weight loss, low grip strength, exhaustion, slow gait speed and low physical activities. Linear regression models were used to examine associations between baseline frailty status and the MoCA scores at follow-up. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the risk of cognitive decline (defined as at least two points decrease of MoCA score) according to baseline frailty status.RESULTS: Seven hundred and eight non-demented older adults were included in the final analyses (mean age: 72.6  5.5 years, male 40.3%); 5.8% were frail, and 40.8% were prefrail at baseline. One hundred and fifty nine (22.5%) participants experienced cognitive decline over two years. After adjustment for baseline MoCA scores and all confounders, being frail at baseline was significantly associated with a decline of 1.48 points (95% confidence interval [CI], -2.37 to -0.59) in MoCA scores, as compared with non-frailty. Frail persons were over two times more likely to experience cognitive decline (adjusted odds ratio 2.28; 95% CI, 1.02 to 5.08), compared to non-frail persons.CONCLUSION: Physical frailty is associated with longitudinal decline in global cognitive function in the non-demented older adults over a period of two years. Physically frail older community-dwellers should be closely monitored for cognitive decline that can be sensitively captured by using the MoCA."
"29292529","Converting MMSE to MoCA and MoCA 5-minute protocol in an educationally heterogeneous sample with stroke or transient ischemic attack.","BACKGROUND: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is psychometrically superior over the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) for cognitive screening in stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). It is free for clinical and research use. The objective of this study is to convert scores from the MMSE to MoCA and MoCA-5-minute protocol (MoCA-5min) and to examine the ability of the converted scores in detecting cognitive impairment after stroke or TIA.METHODS: A total of 904 patients were randomly divided into training (n=623) and validation (n=281) samples matched for demography and cognition. MMSE scores were converted to MoCA and MoCA-5min using (1) equipercentile method with log-linear smoothing and (2) Poisson regression adjusting for age and education. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was used to examine the ability of the converted scores in differentiating patients with cognitive impairment.RESULTS: The mean education was 5.8 (SD=4.6; ranged 0-20) years. The entire spectrum of MMSE scores was converted to MoCA and MoCA-5min using equipercentile method. Relationship between MMSE and MoCA scores was confounded by age and education, and a conversion equation with adjustment for age and education was derived. In the validation sample, the converted scores differentiated cognitively impaired patients with area under receiver operating characteristics curve 0.826 to 0.859.CONCLUSION: We provided 2 methods to convert scores from the MMSE to MoCA and MoCA-5min based on a large sample of patients with stroke or TIA having a wide range of education and cognitive levels. The converted scores differentiated patients with cognitive impairment after stroke or TIA with high accuracy."
