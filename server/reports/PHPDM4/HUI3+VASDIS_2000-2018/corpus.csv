"11236850","Comparison of the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) and the EuroQol EQ-5D in patients treated for intermittent claudication.","The Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) and the EuroQol EQ-5D (EQ-5D) were compared to each other and to other quality-of-life (QoL) measures in patients treated for intermittent claudication. A total of 88 patients with intermittent claudication completed the HUI3, EQ-5D, RAND 36-Item Health Survey 1.0, time tradeoff, standard gamble, and rating scale before revascularization and at follow-up at 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year. The effect of treatment on the HUI3 and EQ-5D dimensions and the overall scores, calculated using published formulas based on societal preferences, were compared. After 1 month of treatment, the majority of patients showed improvement on the HUI3 dimensions ambulation and pain and on the EQ-5D dimensions mobility, usual activities, and pain/discomfort. The mean HUI3 score was significantly higher than the mean EQ-5D score (0.66 and 0.57, respectively, p &lt; 0.01) before treatment. After treatment, however, they were not significantly different from each other (e.g., 12 months after treatment: 0.77 and 0.75, respectively (p &gt; 0.05). After 1 month, the scores did not change significantly over time (p &gt; 0.05). The intraclass correlation coefficient between changes over time in the HUI3 and EQ-5D scores was 0.30, with other health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) measures the correlations for HUI3 and EQ-5D were very similar. In conclusion, both the HUI3 and EQ-5D demonstrated an effect of treatment in patients with intermittent claudication; in addition, they showed similar relationships with other (HRQoL) measures. To demonstrate the effect of revascularization in patients with intermittent claudication, however, clinicians and researchers should be aware of the differences in the mean HUI3 and EQ-5D scores."
"12365482","Comparison of preference-based utilities of the Short-Form 36 Health Survey and Health Utilities Index before and after treatment of patients with intermittent claudication.","The authors compared SF-36 utilities with Health Utilities Index (HUI) utilities (HUI2 and HUI3) assessed in patients with intermittent claudication. A total of 87 patients with intermittent claudication completed the SF-36 and HUI before and 1, 3, and 12 months after revascularization. Utilities were estimated using SF-36 and HUI published algorithms (i.e., both algorithms were based on standard-gamble utilities assessed in random samples of the general population). The utilities were compared using repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance, paired t tests, and univariate linear regression analyses. Before treatment, the mean SF-36 and HUI3 utilities were the same (0.66 vs. 0.66, P = 0.92) and less than the mean HUI2 utility (0.70, P = 0.02). After treatment, all utilities showed improvement from before treatment (P &lt; 0.05); the gain in utilities from treatment was lowest when using the SF-36 (e.g., 0.74, 0.80, 0.77 at 3 months for the SF-36, HUI2, and HUI3, respectively). The correlations of changes over time of the SF-36 with HUI2 utilities and of the SF-36 with HUI3 utilities were 0.39 and 0.49, respectively. The relationships between the SF-36 and HUI2 or HUI3 utilities were moderate to good (i.e., range-adjusted R2 = 31% to 72%). The results suggest that SF-36 data can be transformed to preference-based utilities and be used for economic evaluation in health care. The gain in utilities from treatment, however, was less for SF-36 utilities than for HUI utilities."
"14601159","A view from the bridge: agreement between the SF-6D utility algorithm and the Health Utilities Index.","BACKGROUND: The SF-6D is a new health state classification and utility scoring system based on 6 dimensions ('6D') of the Short Form 36, and permits a &quot;bridging&quot; transformation between SF-36 responses and utilities. The Health Utilities Index, mark 3 (HUI3) is a valid and reliable multi-attribute health utility scale that is widely used. We assessed within-subject agreement between SF-6D utilities and those from HUI3.METHODS: Patients at increased risk of sudden cardiac death and participating in a randomized trial of implantable defibrillator therapy completed both instruments at baseline. Score distributions were inspected by scatterplot and histogram and mean score differences compared by paired t-test. Pearson correlation was computed between instrument scores and also between dimension scores within instruments. Between-instrument agreement was by intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC).RESULTS: SF-6D and HUI3 forms were available from 246 patients. Mean scores for HUI3 and SF-6D were 0.61 (95% CI 0.60-0.63) and 0.58 (95% CI 0.54-0.62) respectively; a difference of 0.03 (p&lt;0.03). Score intervals for HUI3 and SF-6D were (-0.21 to 1.0) and (0.30-0.95). Correlation between the instrument scores was 0.58 (95% CI 0.48-0.68) and agreement by ICC was 0.42 (95% CI 0.31-0.52). Correlations between dimensions of SF-6D were higher than for HUI3.CONCLUSIONS: Our study casts doubt on the whether utilities and QALYs estimated via SF-6D are comparable with those from HUI3. Utility differences may be due to differences in underlying concepts of health being measured, or different measurement approaches, or both. No gold standard exists for utility measurement and the SF-6D is a valuable addition that permits SF-36 data to be transformed into utilities to estimate QALYs. The challenge is developing a better understanding as to why these classification-based utility instruments differ so markedly in their distributions and point estimates of derived utilities."
"15367255","Comparison of the HUI3 with the SF-36 preference based SF-6D in a clinical trial setting.","OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that the Health Utilities Index Mark III (HUI3) and the SF-6D, based on the SF-36, generate similar health state values, and to test and compare their discriminant validity and responsiveness.METHODS: The HUI3 and SF-36 were administered to 331 patients enrolled in a double-blind, multinational phase III clinical trial in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention before hospital discharge and 6 months thereafter.RESULTS: The mean SF-6D baseline health state score was 0.67 compared to the HUI3 of 0.63 with r of 0.616 and intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.40. The relationship was nonlinear with greatest divergence found at the lower levels of health. Both measures were found to agree with known differences in health and to be responsive to changes over time. Nevertheless, disagreement resulted in different estimates of change from baseline (0.08 vs. 0.154).CONCLUSION: Both measures deployed in the present study were found to have discriminant validity, and to be responsive to changes over time in coronary artery disease conditions. Nevertheless, the measures generated different estimates of health state values for this patient population. These differences might in part be the consequence of the health status descriptive system for the HUI that may have been more in line with the hospitalized state than that for the SF-6D. These findings seemed to indicate that measures deployed are not interchangeable for use in cost-utility analysis. More head-to-head comparisons between these two measures are needed to further define and compare relationships in different patient populations."
"14726549","Agreement between patient and proxy assessments of health-related quality of life after stroke using the EQ-5D and Health Utilities Index.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Proxy informants can provide information on patients who are limited in ability to self-assess health-related quality of life (HRQL) after stroke. One alternative is to exclude assessments of such patients and attenuate generalizability. The purpose of this study was to examine patient-proxy agreement on the domains and summary scores of the EQ-5D and Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) after stroke.METHODS: An observational longitudinal cohort of 124 patients hospitalized after ischemic stroke and their family caregivers completed the HRQL measures at baseline and were followed up for 6 months. Patient and proxy agreement was assessed by use of weighted kappa or the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).RESULTS: At baseline, the more observable domains of HRQL demonstrated greater agreement than the more subjective components. Cross-sectional point estimates of agreement were generally acceptable (ICC &gt;0.70) for the EQ-5D Index and HUI3 summary scores when assessed &gt;or=1 month after baseline. Agreement between change scores was generally poor to fair (ICC &lt;0.60), but systematic bias was not observed for the indirect preference-based summary scores between baseline and 6 months.CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that proxy assessments obtained 6 months after stroke are more reliable than those obtained within 2 to 3 weeks after stroke. Although proxy-assessed change scores for indirect preference-based summary scores of the EQ-5D and HUI3 provided suboptimal agreement with patient assessment, limited systematic bias may support their consideration as alternatives to missing data or statistical imputation. Further research into the validity and reliability of proxy assessments is suggested."
"16133651","Health-related quality of life measurements in elderly Canadians with osteoporosis compared to other chronic medical conditions: a population-based study from the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMos).","The objective of this research was to determine the relative decrement in health-related quality of life, as measured by the health utilities index mark 3 (HUI3), in osteoporosis compared to other chronic medical conditions. The impact of chronic medical conditions other than osteoporosis on HUI3 measurements had been previously established in the 1996/1997 Canadian National Population Health Survey (NPHS). The Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMos) is a national population-based study in which regional participants were randomly recruited, regardless of presence of osteoporosis. We analyzed data from participants aged &gt; or = 65 years who completed a baseline HUI3 questionnaire and provided information on their medical history (n=3,750). We determined the age- and gender-adjusted mean decrement in HUI3 for several chronic medical conditions, including osteoporosis. The mean changes in HUI3 adjusted for age and gender (with 95% confidence intervals) were as follows: arthritis -0.10 (-0.11, -0.09), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) -0.07 (-0.09, -0.05), diabetes mellitus -0.05 (-0.08, -0.03), heart disease -0.06 (-0.08, -0.04), hypertension -0.02 (-0.03, -0.01), and osteoporosis -0.08 (-0.11, -0.06), respectively (model r2=0.17; P&lt;0.0001). These findings were comparable to those observed in the NPHS, with the exception of osteoporosis, which had not been previously studied in this fashion. The decrement in HUI3 score seen in participants with osteoporosis was comparable to that observed in other chronic medical conditions, such as arthritis, COPD, diabetes mellitus or heart disease."
"16047506","Health-related quality of life deficits associated with diabetes and comorbidities in a Canadian National Population Health Survey.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of comorbid heart disease, stroke and arthritis on health-related quality of life (HRQL) in people with diabetes in the general Canadian population.METHODS: Data were collected as part of the 1996-1997 Canadian National Population Health Survey. HRQL was assessed using overall Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) and single attribute utility scores. Respondents (N = 66,093) were classified into 1 of 16 groups based on the presence or absence of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and arthritis, in all possible combinations and HRQL scores were compared using analysis of covariance.RESULTS: Overall HUI3 scores for respondents with diabetes alone (0.88, 95% CI: 0.87-0.89) were lower than controls (0.92: 95% CI: 0.92-0.92, p &lt; 0.001). Overall HUI3 scores for diabetes in combination with heart disease (0.77, 95% CI: 0.74-0.79), arthritis (0.78, 95% CI: 0.77-0.79) or stroke (0.79, 95% CI: 0.74-0.85) were considerably lower than diabetes alone. Triplets of comorbidities were associated with overall HRQL deficits of approximately 0.26-0.30, relative to controls.CONCLUSIONS: The illness burden experienced by individuals with diabetes is not only associated with diabetes itself, but largely with comorbid medical conditions."
"15789955","Responsiveness of generic health-related quality of life measures in stroke.","OBJECTIVE: To compare five preference-based generic measures of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in terms of change scores, correlations among change scores, responsiveness, and quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained.DESIGN: Observational longitudinal cohort study where clinical measures and self-assessed HRQOL measures were administered to stroke patients at baseline and at 6 months. Patients were categorized as 'stable', 'some improvement' and 'large improvement' using the Barthel Index, Modified Rankin Scale (MRS), and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). For each group, paired t-tests and variants of effect size were used to compare the responsiveness of preference-based HRQOL summary scores, including the EQ-5D VAS and index-based score, SF-6D, and Health Utilities Index (HUI) Mark 2 (HUI2) and Mark 3 (HUI3) overall utility scores.RESULTS: Ninety-eight of 124 (79%) patients completed the 6-month follow-up. Change scores of the EQ-Index, HUI2, and HUI3 were strongly correlated with changes in the Barthel Index and MRS, while the EQ-5D VAS had higher correlation with CES-D change scores than the other measures. The SF-6D, HUI3, and EQ-Index were generally more responsive than the HUI2 and EQ-5D Visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS). QALY estimates based on the EQ-5D index and HUI3 were twice as large as estimates based on the SF-6D and HUI2.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study may assist in informing the selection of a preference-based generic HRQOL measure, although choice will also depend on study goals and context. We would caution against the generalization of the study results on responsiveness to conditions when more subtle change is expected."
"17689813","Pain and depression in caregivers affected their perception of pain in stroke patients.","OBJECTIVES: Informal caregivers often serve as proxy raters of Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) when patients cannot report on their own behalf. Caregiver depression has been associated with bias in proxy ratings, but few studies have examined the role of caregiver pain. The aim of this study was to determine if caregiver depressive symptoms and/or pain systematically affected patient-proxy agreement on patient HRQL after stroke.STUDY DESIGN AND SETTINGS: Secondary data analysis of 95 stroke patients and their caregivers (dyads) at 6 months poststroke. Caregiver depressive symptoms were measured by Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Rating Scale, and pain was measured using EQ-5D. Using multivariate regression, we examined the effect of caregiver depressive symptoms and pain on patient-proxy difference scores on Health Utilities Index 3 (HUI3) attributes and Short Form-36 domains of vitality and social functioning.RESULTS: Caregiver depressive symptoms and pain were associated with significant differences in patient-proxy scores on HUI3 pain (P&lt;0.05). Depressed caregivers underestimated pain experienced by patients, and caregivers with pain overestimated patient pain. Additionally, an interaction between caregiver depressive symptoms and pain was identified.CONCLUSION: Presence of pain and depressive symptoms in caregivers can significantly affect perceptions of pain in stroke patients. Results suggest that caregivers with pain and/or depression may provide more biased proxy assessments of pain."
"19760103","Measuring health-related quality of life in population-based studies of coronary heart disease: comparing six generic indexes and a disease-specific proxy score.","PURPOSE: To compare HRQoL differences with CHD in generic indexes and a proxy CVD-specific score in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.METHODS: The National Health Measurement Study, a cross-sectional random-digit-dialed telephone survey of adults aged 35-89, administered the EQ-5D, QWB-SA, HUI2, HUI3, SF-36v2 (yielding PCS, MCS, and SF-6D), and HALex. Analyses compared 3,350 without CHD (group 1), 265 with CHD not taking chest pain medication (group 2), and 218 with CHD currently taking chest pain medication (group 3), with and without adjustment for demographic variables and comorbidities. Data on 154 patients from heart failure clinics were used to construct a proxy score utilizing generic items probing CVD symptoms.RESULTS: Mean scores differed between CHD groups for all indexes with and without adjustment (P &lt; 0.0001 for all except MCS P = 0.018). Unadjusted group 3 versus 1 differences were about three times larger than for group 2 versus 1. Standardized differences for the proxy score were similar to those for generic indexes, and were about 1.0 for all except MCS for group 3 versus 1.CONCLUSIONS: Generic indexes capture differences in HRQoL in population-based studies of CHD similarly to a score constructed from questions probing CVD-specific symptoms."
"23090747","The psychometric testing of the Thai version of the Health Utilities Index in patients with ischemic heart disease.","The HEALTH UTILITIES INDEX(®) (HUI(®)) is a family of systems designed to measure utility scores of health-related quality of life for comprehensive health states. There are two current HUI systems: HUI2 and HUI3. Since no Thai version of self-administered HUI was available, the study objective was to translate and test the psychometric properties of the HUI self-complete Thai-language questionnaire in terms of practicality, reliability, validity and responsiveness. A convenience sample of 216 outpatients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) was selected. Mean age was 60.3 ± 7.2 (range 37-77) and 37.2% were males. The floor and ceiling effects of the total scores for both HUI were &lt;15%. The intraclass correlation coefficients were from moderate to high for all attributes and total scores. The correlations of HUI2 and HUI3 when compared with the EQ-5D and MacNew global scores were high (Spearman's rho &gt; 0.5, P &lt; 0.001). Discriminant validity was proved among three groups of different specific activity scale classes (P &lt; 0.001). The effect size was the highest (0.92) in the patients reporting worsened health status assessed by the HUI2. In conclusion, both of the HUIs demonstrated conditionally satisfactory psychometric properties in the patients with IHD."
"22407384","Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) demonstrated construct validity in a Nigerian population with hypertension.","PURPOSE: This study seeks to establish the construct validity of Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3)--a health state utility measure--in a Nigerian population of hypertensive patients.METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in a population of hypertensive patients in two tertiary hospitals located in South-Eastern Nigeria. A priori hypotheses were tested to establish construct validity.RESULTS: A total of 384 participants were interviewed. Hypertensive patients with stroke or coronary heart disease (CHD) had a lower overall utility value compared to those with hypertension alone. There was a significant difference in group means of 0.53 (95 % confidence interval of 0.44-0.62); t = 11.8, p &lt; 0.01, between participants that had hypertension alone and participants with hypertension and stroke. Also, there was a significant difference in group means of 0.44 (95 % confidence interval of 0.34-0.56); t = 8.2, p &lt; 0.01, between participants that had hypertension alone and participants with hypertension and CHD. Generally, there was a significant health-related quality of life deficit among patients with severe clinical variables compared to those with milder clinical variables.CONCLUSION: HUI3 demonstrated constructed validity among a population of Nigerian patients with high blood pressure."
