"17951971","Oxidative DNA damage estimated by plasma 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG): influence of 4, 4'-methylenebis (2-chloroaniline) exposure and smoking.","Oxidative DNA damage may play an important role in the human carcinogenic process. Recently, we reported a case of bladder cancer among 4, 4'-methylenebis (2-chloroaniline) (MBOCA)-exposed workers. By measuring the plasma level of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), we investigated the association between oxidative DNA damage and MBOCA exposure. In addition, we examined the effects of different confounders on the plasma level of 8-OHdG. We undertook a cross-sectional survey at four MBOCA-producing factories in Taiwan (158 subjects). Plasma 8-OHdG levels and urinary MBOCA concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Personal characteristics were collected by questionnaire. The workers were classified according to their job titles as exposed (n=57) or unexposed (n=101) groups as well as classified according to urinary MBOCA levels as high urinary MBOCA (&gt;20 microg/g creatinine) (n=45) or low urinary MBOCA (n=108) groups. Neither the MBOCA-exposed workers nor the high urinary MBOCA workers had a significant increase in the mean plasma 8-OHdG level, even after adjustment for potential confounders. Age and gender were significantly positively correlated with plasma 8-OHdG levels. Smokers among high urinary MBOCA workers also had significantly higher 8-OHdG levels than non-smokers among high urinary MBOCA workers. Our study provides evidence that smoking rather than MBOCA exposure induces elevation of plasma 8-OHdG levels among workers exposed to MBOCA, indicating that oxidative DNA damage does not play an important role in the carcinogenic processes of MBOCA."
"19564173","Cancer incidence and exposure to 4,4'-methylene-bis-ortho-chloroaniline (MbOCA).","AIMS: To monitor the occurrence of cancer in a recently defined cohort of UK workers engaged in the manufacture of polyurethane elastomers using 4,4'-methylene-bis-ortho-chloroaniline.METHODS: A cohort of 308 male production workers from seven factories have been enumerated. All employees had a minimum of 12 months employment and were first employed at one of the participating factories in the period 1973-2000. Mortality and cancer incidence data for the period 1979-2007 were compared with expected values based on national rates.RESULTS: Mortality from all cancers combined was below the expected value [observed (Obs) 5, standardized mortality ratio (SMR) 68]. There was a single death from bladder cancer (SMR 560). The incidence of all cancers combined was also below expectation [Obs 9, standardized registration ratio (SRR) 77]. Site-specific incidence was unexceptional except there was a non-significant excess of bladder cancer based on two cases (SRR 328).CONCLUSIONS: The findings for bladder cancer should be treated with caution as they relate to a relatively early period of follow-up and are based on very small numbers."

Socio-demographic characteristic data including gender, age, education level, height, weight waist circumference and blood pressure, past history of coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and unhealthy habit of smoking and drinking, were investigated. The patient levels of fasting plasma glucose, fast insulin glycated, hemoglobin and blood lipids were measured on the next day. All subjects were evaluated with regards to the scores of Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), clinical memory scale (CMS), daily living skills assessment (ADL) and Hamilton depression scale (HAMD).RESULT: (1) MCI was more frequently detected in MS subjects than that in the healthy controls (24.4% vs 1.2%); (2)the scores of general MoCA and several parts of MoCA were lower in the MS subjects (scores of general 26.8 ± 0.5, EF4.40 ± 0.04, NAM2.60 ± 0.06, MEM3.60 ± 0.20, ATT5.60 ± 0.09, LANG2.60 ± 0.08, ABS1.50 ± 0.10, ORT5.40 ± 0.13)than those of the controls (scores of general 27.6 ± 0.4, EF4.50 ± 0.05, NAM2.70 ± 0.08, MEM4.20 ± 0.11, ATT5.70 ± 0.08, LANG2.60 ± 0.09, ABS1.60 ± 0.07, ORT5.40 ± 0.10). No statistically significant differences existed in the scores of general MoCA and several parts except for memory and abstract (P &gt; 0.05). The scores of general CMS and several parts of CMS were lower in the MS subjects (scores of general 72 ± 8, memory function reflected in memory 14 ± 2, associating study 14 ± 3, free image memory 14 ± 4, recognition of meaningless figure 16 ± 3, recollection ability of human figure 14 ± 3) than those in the controls (scores of general 85 ± 7, memory function reflected in memory 16 ± 2,associating study 16 ± 3, free image memory 17 ± 3, recognition of meaningless figure 18 ± 3, recollection ability of human figure 17 ± 3). And the differences had statistical significance (P &lt; 0.05); (3) a high degree of education was a protective factor of MCI (OR = 0.512, P = 0.011) while diabetes, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome were the independent risk factors of MCI (OR(1) = 4.240, P(1) = 0.014; OR(2) = 7.230, P(2) = 0.023; OR(3) = 8.620, P(3) = 0.001).CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome are the independent risk factors of MCI."

The patient's gender, age, education level, nature of work, sleep status, marital status, whether or not participating in physical exercise, having smoking and drinking habits, whether combined with hypertension and diabetes for MCI prevalence of the elderly were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: We should pay attention to take appropriate measures in preventing the cognitive decline for populations as elderly, especially for women, senior, no spouse, engaged in manual labor, low education level, poor quality of sleep and no physical exercise, with smoking and drinking, combined with hypertension and diabetes."
"23872589","Cognitive outcomes after acute coronary syndrome: a population based comparison with transient ischaemic attack and minor stroke.","OBJECTIVE: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is associated with increased risk of cognitive decline when compared with controls, but case:control studies are subject to selection bias. We therefore compared cognitive outcomes in ACS with transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and minor stroke, diseases with similar risk factor burden generally considered to be at high risk of cognitive decline.DESIGN: Prospective population based cohort studySETTING: Oxford Vascular Study (OXVASC) carried out within a defined population of 91 000 in Oxfordshire, UK.PATIENTS: 614 in total: 216 ACS, 182 TIA, 216 minor (non-disabling) stroke.OUTCOME MEASURES: Mini-Mental-State-Examination (MMSE), Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-modified (TICSm), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at 1 and 5 years.RESULTS: Overall risk factor burden was similar across groups but ACS patients had more smoking (27% vs 14%, p&lt;0.001) and less hypertension (45% vs 53%, p&lt;0.01) and atrial fibrillation (6% vs 14%, p&lt;0.001). Cognitive outcomes were worse at 1 year in ACS versus TIA patients: mean±SD MMSE 26.6±2.7 vs 27.6±2.5, p&lt;0.0001; OR=2.14, 95% CI 1.11 to 4.13 for moderate/severe cognitive impairment (MMSE &lt;24) with a similar trend at 5 years, and ACS outcomes were more similar to minor stroke. Memory and language versus frontal/executive subtests were relatively more impaired in ACS than TIA and minor stroke patients.CONCLUSIONS: Risk of cognitive impairment after ACS is similar to minor stroke and higher than TIA with implications for clinical practice including consent and adherence with medication. Differences in cognitive domain performance suggest a greater role for degenerative brain pathology in ACS which may be linked to vascular risk profile and cardiac factors."
"23845902","Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and other risk factors of mild cognitive impairment among Chinese type 2 diabetic patients.","OBJECTIVE: To identify some risk factors of MCI among patients with type 2 diabetes(T2DM) and to find if there is any correlation between these factors and the degree of cognitive decline.METHODS: A total of 155 patients with T2DM referred to the Department of Endocrinology at First Hospital of Qinhuangdao were enrolled. To assess MCI the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scoring system was used. There were 66 patients with MCI and 89 patients without MCI (control). HbAlc, blood lipid, liver and renal functions were measured in all subjects.RESULTS: Compared with the control group, type 2 diabetic patients with MCI had a longer duration of diabetes; higher non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), triglycerides, total cholesterol, HbA1c, and BMI; and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (P&lt;0.05). The rates of patients with a history of habitual light-to-moderate alcohol consumption, a high proportion of Mediterranean-type diet, and regular physical activity were lower; and the rate of current smoking was higher in type 2 diabetic patients with MCI than the control group (P&lt;0.05). Among patients with MCI, the results indicated that MoCA score was negatively correlated with non-HDL-C (r=-0.761 P&lt;0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that non-HDL-C can act as a readily available method for estimating risk of MCI in Chinese type 2 diabetic patient in routine clinical practice. Good lifestyle likely reduces MCI risk in diabetic patients."
"23577654","Assessment of cognitive function in adult patients with hemorrhagic moyamoya disease who received no surgical revascularization.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Due to controversial surgical treatment for hemorrhagic moyamoya disease (MMD), a large proportion of these patients chose conservative treatment. The aim of this study was to assess cognitive function in adult patients with hemorrhagic MMD who received no surgical revascularization.METHODS: Twenty-six adult hemorrhagic MMD patients with only intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) confirmed by positive computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scan, 20 patients with spontaneous IVH whose digital subtraction angiography results were negative, and 30 healthy controls were identified and matched for age, gender, education background and living area. Cognitive function was evaluated by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The non-parametric test was used for comparisons among the three groups.RESULTS: No patient was confirmed cognitive dysfunction at the initial screening. Twenty-four (92%) cases presented mild cognitive impairment (MCI) after 1 year. All the cases demonstrated MCI after 2 years. The difference between cases and healthy controls was statistically significant at the second screening (P = 0.000) and the third screening (P = 0.000), as was that between cases and patients with spontaneous IVH at the second screening (P = 0.000) and the third screening (P = 0.000). In addition, there were significant decreases in all MoCA subscores (P = 0.000) with special regards to delayed recall, visual space and executive function in cases compared with the other two groups. Moreover, significant differences were found in the subgroups of smoking (P = 0.021) and Suzuki angiographic classification of MMD (P = 0.030).CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairment is a long-term complication for adult hemorrhagic MMD patients who underwent conservative treatment."
"23491024","Rapid and intermediate N-acetylators are less susceptible to oxidative damage among 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (MBOCA)-exposed workers.","OBJECTIVES: In this study, we explored the association between a marker of oxidative stress, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and genetic polymorphism of the carcinogen-metabolizing enzyme N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) among 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (MBOCA)-exposed workers.METHODS: The study population was recruited from four MBOCA-producing factories, and included 57 MBOCA-exposed workers and 101 unexposed control workers. Personal characteristics were collected by questionnaire. Plasma 8-OHdG levels were measured by LC/MS/MS. NAT2 alleles were measured by polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).RESULTS: NAT2 polymorphism influenced the plasma 8-OHdG levels of MBOCA-exposed workers, but not of non-exposed workers. No difference between exposed and control groups was found for the crude 8-OHdG levels among rapid, intermediate, and slow acetylators. After adjusting for gender, age, smoking, and alcohol consumption habit, the 8-OHdG concentration in the MBOCA-exposed workers was 0.18pg/ml (95% CI -1.80 to -0.12) lower than the control group among rapid and intermediate acetylators. However, the difference between exposed and control groups was not significant for slow acetylators.CONCLUSION: Gene-environment interactions could play a role in the carcinogenesis of occupational MBOCA exposure. We suggest that the impact of the NAT2 acetylator status is low, if at all, on the generation of the oxidative stress marker 8-OHdG in the investigated exposed group."
"26413475","Structural and physiological MRI correlates of occult cerebrovascular disease in late-onset epilepsy.","Late-onset epilepsy (LOE), with onset after 50 years of age, is often attributed to underlying occult cerebrovascular disease. LOE is associated with a three-fold increase in subsequent stroke risk, therefore it is important to improve our understanding of pathophysiology. In this exploratory study, we aimed to determine whether established structural magnetic resonance imaging markers and novel physiological imaging markers of occult cerebrovascular disease were more common in patients with LOE than age-matched controls. Sixteen patients with LOE (mean age ± SD: 67.6 ± 6.5 years) and 15 age-matched control subjects (mean age: 65.1 ± 3.9 years) underwent a 3 T MRI scan protocol. T1-weighted images and T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images were used to determine cortical grey matter volume and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume respectively, whilst multiple delay time arterial spin labelling (ASL) images were collected at rest and during a hypercapnic challenge. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and arterial arrival time (AAT) were calculated from ASL data under both normocapnic and hypercapnic conditions. Cerebrovascular reactivity was also calculated for both CBF and AAT relative to the change in end-tidal CO2. Patients with LOE were found to have significantly lower cortical volume than control subjects (33.8 ± 3.8% of intracranial volume vs. 38.0 ± 5.5%, p = 0.02) and significantly higher WMH volume (1339 ± 1408 mm3 vs. 514 ± 481 mm3, p = 0.047). Baseline whole brain AAT was found to be significantly prolonged in patients with LOE in comparison to control subjects (1539 ± 129 ms vs. 1363 ± 167 ms, p = 0.005). Voxel-based analysis showed the significant prolongation of AAT to be predominantly distributed in the frontal and temporal lobes. Voxel-based morphometry showed the lower cortical volume to be localised primarily to temporal lobes. No significant differences in CBF or cerebrovascular reactivity were found between the two groups. Baseline whole brain AAT and cortical volume differences persisted upon further analysis to take account of differences in smoking history between patients and control subjects. These findings suggest that occult cerebrovascular disease is relevant to the pathophysiology of LOE."
"26218598","Cardiovascular Risk Factors Associated with Smaller Brain Volumes in Regions Identified as Early Predictors of Cognitive Decline.","PURPOSE: To determine in a large multiethnic cohort the cardiovascular and genetic risk factors associated with smaller volume in the hippocampus, precuneus, and posterior cingulate, and their association with preclinical deficits in cognitive performance in patients younger and older than 50 years.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved the study and all participants provided written informed consent. Eligible for this study were 1629 participants (700 men and 929 women; mean age, 50.0 years ± 10.2 [standard deviation]) drawn from the population-based Dallas Heart Study who underwent laboratory and clinical analysis in an initial baseline visit and approximately 7 years later underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging with automated volumetry and cognitive assessment with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Regression analysis showed associations between risk factors and segmental volumes, and associations between these volumes with cognitive performance in participants younger and older than 50 years.RESULTS: Lower hippocampal volume was associated with previous alcohol consumption (standardized estimate, -0.04; P = .039) and smoking (standardized estimate, -0.04; P = .048). Several risk factors correlated with lower total brain, posterior cingulate, and precuneus volumes. Higher total (standardized estimate, 0.06; P = .050), high-density lipoprotein (standardized estimate, 0.07; P = .003), and low-density lipoprotein (standardized estimate, 0.04; P = .037) cholesterol levels were associated with larger posterior cingulate volume, and higher triglyceride levels (standardized estimate, 0.06; P = .004) were associated with larger precuneus volume. Total MoCA score was associated with posterior cingulate volume (standardized estimate, 0.13; P = .001) in younger individuals and with hippocampal (standardized estimate, 0.06; P &lt; .05) and precuneus (standardized estimate, 0.08; P &lt; .023) volumes in older adults.CONCLUSION: Smaller volumes in specific brain regions considered to be early markers of dementia risk were associated with specific cardiovascular disease risk factors and cognitive deficits in a predominantly midlife multiethnic population-based sample. Additionally, the risk factors most associated with these brain volumes differed in participants younger and older than 50 years, as did the association between brain volume and MoCA score."
"25903076","Combined effect of obstructive sleep apnea and chronic smoking on cognitive impairment.","OBJECTIVES: Little is known about combined effect of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and chronic smoking on cognitive impairment. We aimed to determine whether smoking synergizes with OSA in deteriorating cognitive function and whether smoking cessation contributes to cognitive benefits.METHODS: One hundred and eighteen male patients were enrolled in the study and asked to complete neurocognitive function tests including Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), clock drawing test (CDT), and verbal fluency test (VFT). Variables of those neurocognitive function tests were analyzed with two factors: OSA and smoking.RESULTS: After adjustment of potential confounding factors, an OSA-by-smoking interaction was found in CDT-C scores and a main smoking effect were showed in MoCA scores. Smoking patients with OSA had the worst performance in the four tests compared with the other three groups (smoking patients without OSA, non-smoking patients with and without OSA). Ex-smokers with OSA tended to perform better than current smokers, but still worse than never-smokers with OSA in those tests.CONCLUSION: The results suggested that the coexistence of OSA and chronic smoking resulted in more pronounced cognitive deficits than either factor along. Smoking cessation may benefit cognitive function to some extents in patients with OSA."

"26959108","Metabolic Syndrome and Cognitive Performance Among Chinese =50 Years: A Cross-Sectional Study with 3988 Participants.","BACKGROUND: To date, the relationship between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cognitive performance has not been well defined. This study aimed to explore the relationship between MetS and cognitive performance among Chinese elderly population.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed, with data collected in seven clinical centers from five provinces of Northern China. All recruited participants were =50 years of age and complained with cognitive impairment or were reported with cognitive impairment by his/her caregiver(s). MetS was diagnosed according to the criteria issued by Chinese Medical Association Diabetes Association. Cognitive function was scored by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).RESULTS: Three thousand nine hundred eighty-eight participants (in an average of 66.4<U+2009>±<U+2009>8.8 years of age, male 53.1%) were included in the analysis. Six hundred seventy-three (16.9%) participants were diagnosed with MetS, and 3013 (75.6%) participants had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (MoCA score &lt;26). There was no statistically significant difference in the MoCA scores between participants with MetS (21.0<U+2009>±<U+2009>5.4) and without MetS (21.3<U+2009>±<U+2009>5.3). In the logistic regression, after adjusting factors of age, education, marital status, smoking, and physical activity, diabetes and dyslipidemia were associated with MCI, whereas hypertension and overweight or obesity were not. Participants with diabetes had a higher risk of MCI (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.24, 95% CI: 1.03-1.50). Participants with dyslipidemia had a lower risk of MCI (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.81, 95% CI: 0.68-0.97).CONCLUSION: In our study, MetS is not associated with cognitive performance in elderly Chinese population. However, elderly Chinese with diabetes would have lower cognition function, and the dyslipidemia might be reversely associated with the cognitive function."
"26883012","Correlates of depressive symptoms in individuals attending outpatient stroke clinics.","Background and purpose Depressive symptoms are common post-stroke. We examined stroke deficits and lifestyle factors that are independent predictors for depressive symptomology. Methods A retrospective chart review was performed for patients' post-stroke who attended outpatient clinics at a hospital in Southwestern Ontario between 1 January 2014 and 30 September 2014. Demographic variables, stroke deficits, secondary stroke risk factors and disability study measures [Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)] were analyzed. Results Of the 221 outpatients who attended the stroke clinics (53% male; mean age<U+2009>=<U+2009>65.2<U+2009>±<U+2009>14.9 years; mean time post-stroke 14.6<U+2009>±<U+2009>20.1 months), 202 patients were used in the final analysis. About 36% of patients (mean<U+2009>=<U+2009>5.17<U+2009>±<U+2009>5.96) reported mild to severe depressive symptoms (PHQ-9<U+2009>=<U+2009>5). Cognitive impairment (CI), smoking, pain and therapy enrollment (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01) were significantly associated with depressive symptoms. Patients reporting CI were 4 times more likely to score highly on the PHQ-9 than those who did not report CI (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.72). While controlling for age, MoCA scores negatively related to depressive symptoms with higher PHQ-9 scores associated with lower MoCA scores (r=<U+2009>-0.39, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.005). Conclusions High levels of depressive symptoms are common in the chronic phase post-stroke and were partially related to cognition, pain, therapy enrollment and lifestyle factors. Implications for Rehabilitation Stroke patients who report cognitive deficits, pain, tobacco use or being enrolled in therapy may experience increased depressive symptoms. A holistic perspective of disease and lifestyle factors should be considered while assessing risk of depressive symptoms in stroke patients. Patients at risk for depressive symptoms should be monitored at subsequent outpatient visits."
"26721459","Computed tomography perfusion imaging may predict cognitive impairment in patients with first-time anterior circulation transient ischemic attack.","To determine whether computed tomography perfusion imaging (CTPI)-derived parameters are associated with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) in patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA). Patients with first-time anterior circulation TIA (diagnosed within 24 h of onset) and normal cognition, treated between August 2009 and August 2014 at the Department of Neurology of Chengdu Military General Hospital, China, were analyzed retrospectively. Patients underwent whole-brain CTPI within 1 week of TIA to detect cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean transit time (MTT) and time to peak (TTP) in the ischemic region. Based on cognitive function assessment 4 weeks after TIA, using the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and mini mental state examination, the patients were divided into control and VCI groups. CTPI parameters and other clinical data were compared between groups, and Spearman's correlation analysis used to identify associations between cognitive scores and CTPI parameters in the VCI group. 50 patients (25 per group; aged 55-72 years) were included. Patient age, gender, smoking status, alcohol consumption, educational level, time from TIA onset to admission, time from TIA onset to CTPI, and prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation and hyperhomocysteinemia did not differ between groups. Both groups showed TTP and MTT prolongation, CBF reduction, but no change in CBV in the ischemic region; these changes were significantly larger in the VCI group (P &lt; 0.05). MTT correlated negatively with MoCA score (r = -0.51, P = 0.009). CTPI could facilitate early diagnosis of VCI in patients with anterior circulation TIA. "
"29271534","Vascular risk factors and depression in Parkinson's disease.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to address the vascular depression hypothesis in Parkinson's disease (PD) from a large cohort of Chinese population.METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of 1784 Chinese patients with PD was conducted. Patients were divided into absence of depression (score = 20) and presence of depression (score &gt; 20) based on assessment of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Other clinical assessments included the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the frontal assessment battery (FAB) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).RESULTS: Patients with depression showed a higher proportion of women, longer disease duration, higher UPDRS part III score, higher levodopa equivalent daily dose use, higher occurrences of motor fluctuation and dyskinesia, lower FAB score and lower MoCA score than those without depression (P &lt; 0.05). The proportions of drinking and overweight/obesity in the depression group were significantly lower than those in the non-depression group (P &lt; 0.05). A forward binary logistic regression model indicated that depression in PD was associated with female sex [odds ratio (OR) 1.376, P = 0.025], higher UPDRS part III score (OR 1.042, P &lt; 0.001), lower FAB score (OR 0.937, P = 0.015), anxiety (OR 18.156, P &lt; 0.001) and overweight/obesity (OR 0.700, P = 0.019), whereas no associations were found with hypertension, diabetes, smoking, drinking, hyperlipidaemia and heart disease.CONCLUSIONS: Our study failed to verify the vascular depression hypothesis in PD. On the contrary, it was demonstrated that overweight/obesity is negatively associated with the presence of depression in PD."
"29066899","Sex differences in obesity and cognitive function in a cognitively normal aging Chinese Han population.","BACKGROUND: Sex differences in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment have been well recognized. However, sex differences in cognitive function and obesity in cognitively normal aging Chinese Han population have not attracted much attention.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between sex, obesity, and cognitive function in an elderly Chinese population with normal cognitive function.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 228 cognitively normal aging participants (males/females =93/135) entered this study. Their general demographic information (sex, age, and education) was collected by standardized questionnaire. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and serum lipid levels were measured. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to assess participants' cognitive function.CONCLUSION: Our finding suggests that there are significant sex differences in obesity and specific cognitive domains in aging Chinese Han population with normal cognitive function."
"28260915","Prevalence of mild cognitive impairment in employable patients after acute coronary event in cardiac rehabilitation.","INTRODUCTION: Adequate cognitive function in patients is a prerequisite for successful implementation of patient education and lifestyle coping in comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs. Although the association between cardiovascular diseases and cognitive impairments (CIs) is well known, the prevalence particularly of mild CI in CR and the characteristics of affected patients have been insufficiently investigated so far.METHODS: In this prospective observational study, 496 patients (54.5 ± 6.2 years, 79.8% men) with coronary artery disease following an acute coronary event (ACE) were analyzed. Patients were enrolled within 14 days of discharge from the hospital in a 3-week inpatient CR program. Patients were tested for CI using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) upon admission to and discharge from CR. Additionally, sociodemographic, clinical, and physiological variables were documented. The data were analyzed descriptively and in a multivariate stepwise backward elimination regression model with respect to CI.CONCLUSION: The prevalence of CI in CR was considerably high, affecting more than one-third of cardiac patients. Besides age and education level, CI was associated with heavy workloads and a longer sick leave before ACE."
"28230198","Longitudinal association of hypertension and diabetes mellitus with cognitive functioning in a general 70-year-old population: the SONIC study.","Both hypertension and diabetes in middle-aged individuals have been suggested to be predictive indicators of cognitive decline. However, the association of hypertension, diabetes and their combination with cognitive functioning is still controversial in older people. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between cognitive decline and hypertension, diabetes, and their combination in 70-year-old people based on a 3-year longitudinal analysis. Four hundred and fifty-four people aged 70 (±1) years who participated in the Japanese longitudinal cohort study of Septuagenarians, Octogenarians and Nonagenarians Investigation with Centenarians (SONIC) were recruited randomly from a general population and were monitored for 3 years. The data, including most of the demographics, cognitive functioning measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Japanese version (MoCA-J), blood pressure, blood chemistry and other medical histories, were collected at baseline and during the follow-up. The prevalence of hypertension noted in the follow-up survey was significantly higher than than noted at baseline. The mean MoCA-J score at follow-up was not significantly different from the score obtained at baseline. However, the participants with diabetes, especially combined with hypertension at baseline, had significantly lower MoCA-J scores than those without lifestyle-related diseases. The combination of hypertension and diabetes was still a significant risk factor for cognitive decline, considering the MoCA-J scores obtained during the follow-up after adjustments at baseline, relative to sex, body mass index, dyslipidemia, smoking, excessive alcohol intake, antihypertensive treatment and education level (ß=-0.14; P&lt;0.01). Our findings indicate that diabetes and the combination of hypertension and diabetes are clear risk factors for future cognitive decline in elderly individuals who are 70 years of age."
"29444740","Associations between modifiable lifestyle factors and multidimensional cognitive health among community-dwelling old adults: stratified by educational level.","BACKGROUND: Cognition is multidimensional, and each domain plays a unique and crucial part in successful daily life engagement. However, less attention has been paid to multi-domain cognitive health for the elderly, and the role of lifestyle factors in each domain remains unclear.METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 3,230 older adults aged 60+ years in Xiamen, China, in 2016. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to measure general cognition and six specific sub-domains. To account for educational effects, we adjusted the MoCA score and divided respondents into three education-specific groups (low, moderate, and high education groups with =5, 6~8, and =9 years of education, respectively). A series of proportional odds models were used to detect the associations between two categories of lifestyle factors - substance abuse (cigarette and alcohol) and leisure activity (TV watching, reading, smartphone use, social activity, and exercise) - and general cognition and the six sub-domains in those three groups.RESULTS: Among the 3,230 respondents, 2,617 eligible participants were included with a mean age of 69.05 ± 7.07 years. Previous or current smoking/drinking was not associated with MoCA scores in the whole population, but unexpectedly, the ex-smokers in the low education group performed better in general cognition (OR = 2.22) and attention (OR = 2.05) than their never-smoking counterparts. Modest TV watching, reading, and smartphone use also contributed to better cognition among elderly participants in the low education group. For the highly educated elderly, comparatively longer reading (&gt;3.5 hours/week) was inversely associated with general cognition (OR = 0.53), memory (OR = 0.59), and language (OR = 0.54), while adequate exercise (5~7 days/week) was positively related to these factors with OR = 1.48, OR = 1.49, and OR = 1.53, respectively. For the moderately educated elderly, only modest reading was significantly beneficial.CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle factors play different roles in multidimensional cognitive health in different educational groups, indicating that individual intervention strategies should be designed according to specific educational groups and different cognitive sub-domains."
