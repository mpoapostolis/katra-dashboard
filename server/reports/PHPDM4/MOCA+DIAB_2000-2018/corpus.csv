"15578328","The impaired response of non-obese hereditary hypertriglyceridemic rats to glucose load is associated with low glucose storage in energy reserves.","The aim of the study was to determine the contribution of skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and liver to the impaired glucose clearance manifesting itself during the initial phase of OGTT in a non-obese animal model of insulin resistance, hereditary hypertriglyceridemic (HHTg) rats. Glucose utilisation and storage in insulin target tissues in vivo and in vitro after a glucose load (3 g/kg b. wt.) administered intragastrically following overnight fasting was compared in adult male HHTg rats and Wistar normotriglyceridemic controls after short-term (2 wk) high-sucrose (70 % calories as sucrose) feeding period. In comparison with normotriglyceridemic controls, in HHTg rats the glucose administration did not stimulate GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue that was associated with decreased glucose utilisation by these tissues in vitro. The acute glucose supply did not result in increased glycogen synthesis in the liver and fatty acid synthesis de novo in adipose tissue. On the contrary, the serum glucose, triglyceride and free fatty acid levels remained elevated. In conclusion, in the tissues of HHTg rats, despite the increased insulinemia, the processes leading toward increased glucose utilisation and processes transforming glucose into storage forms, such as triglycerides in adipose tissue and glycogen in skeletal muscle and liver, did not start within this time interval. The combination of the impaired glucose utilisation and the impaired glucose storage in energy reserves leads to higher glycaemia following glucose load in HHTg rats."
"16497094","Glucose-fatty acid interaction in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue in insulin resistance.","Insulin resistance (IR) is the result of long-lasting positive energy balance and the imbalance between the uptake of energy rich substrates (glucose, lipids) and energy output. The defects in the metabolism of glucose in IR and type 2 diabetes are closely associated with the disturbances in the metabolism of lipids. In this review, we have summarized the evidence indicating that one of the important mechanisms underlying the development of IR is the impaired ability of skeletal muscle to oxidize fatty acids as a consequence of elevated glucose oxidation in the situation of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia and the impaired ability to switch easily between glucose and fat oxidation in response to homeostatic signals. The decreased fat oxidation results into the accumulation of intermediates of fatty acid metabolism that are supposed to interfere with the insulin signaling cascade and in consequence negatively influence the glucose utilization. Pathologically elevated fatty acid concentration in serum is now accepted as an important risk factor leading to IR. Adipose tissue plays a crucial role in the regulation of fatty acid homeostasis. The adipose tissue may be the primary site where the early metabolic disturbances leading to the development of IR take place and the development of IR in other tissues follows. In this review we present recent evidence of mutual interaction between skeletal muscle and adipose tissue in the establishment of IR and type 2 diabetes."
"22011410","Serum level of endogenous secretory receptor for advanced glycation end products and other factors in type 2 diabetic patients with mild cognitive impairment.","OBJECTIVE: Determine the serum levels of endogenous secretory receptor for advanced glycation end products (esRAGEs) in patients with type 2 diabetes and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and in control patients with type 2 diabetes but no MCI, and examine the relationship of esRAGE and MCI with other clinical factors.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 101 patients with type 2 diabetes who were hospitalized in the Department of Endocrinology at Fujian Provincial Hospital between January 2010 and January 2011 were enrolled. There were 58 patients with MCI and 43 patients without MCI (control). Serum levels of esRAGE were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Other clinical parameters were also measured.RESULTS: Type 2 diabetic patients with MCI had a longer duration of diabetes; elevated HbA(1c), total cholesterol (CHOL), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), intima-media thickness, C-reactive protein (CRP), and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (ba-PWV); and lower ankle brachial index (ABI) and esRAGE relative to the control group. Among patients with MCI, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score was positively correlated with serum esRAGE but negatively correlated with CHOL. Spearman rank correlation analysis indicated that esRAGE was positively correlated with MoCA score and ABI but negatively correlated with ba-PWV, CHOL, TG, and CRP in all subjects.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that esRAGE may be a potential protective factor for dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and MCI in patients with type 2 diabetes."
"21945986","Cognitive performance in asymptomatic patients with advanced carotid disease.","OBJECTIVE: : In the absence of stroke or transient ischemic attack, patients with advanced carotid stenosis or occlusion (ICAs/o) are considered asymptomatic, yet they are prone to mostly subtle cognitive impairment.BACKGROUND: : The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) often fails to detect mild cognitive impairment. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is more sensitive in recognizing such changes.METHODS: : Scores on the MoCA and MMSE were compared in 70 asymptomatic patients with ICAs/o and 70 controls matched for demographic variables and vascular risk factors.RESULTS: : MMSE scores fell mostly within the normal range in both patients and controls. Differences were significant for total MoCA scores (P&lt;0.001). Patients with ICAs/o performed worse on visuospatial and executive function (P=0.018), abstraction (P&lt;0.001), and delayed recall (P&lt;0.001). Lower MoCA scores were associated with diabetes (odds ratio=6.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.277-32.220; P=0.024) and older age (odds ratio=0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.780-0.956; P=0.004). Patients with diabetes performed worse on delayed recall (P&lt;0.001), and patients with hypertension were worse on the MoCA naming subtest (P=0.04).CONCLUSIONS: : The MoCA successfully identified reduced cognitive status in patients with ICAs/o. The MoCA subtest scores revealed a pattern of cognitive impairment similar to that documented in other studies using more extensive neuropsychological tests. MoCA could be used as part of the clinical evaluation of patients with ICAs/o."

Improved cumulative logistic regression (ICLR) was used to analyze the determinants of AD patients with depression.RESULTS: 196 AD patients were investigated. Among the 196 AD patients, there were 60 (30.6%) males and 136 (69.4%) females, at 58 - 89 years of age (72.3 ± 6.0). Physical activity, diabetes, MoCA, hearing, economic sources and alcohol were related to the degree of depression of AD patients (P &lt; 0.10). The difference between &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;mild depression&quot; was smaller than difference between &quot;mild depression&quot; and &quot;severe depression&quot;.CONCLUSION: AD patients with mild depression were the target population for prevention and they were influenced by several factors listed above."

One hundred and fifty-seven middle-aged type 2 diabetic patients were enrolled in this cross-section study (age 40~69, mean age 55 ± 7). There were 93 patients with MCI (MoCA score&lt;26) in MCI group and 64 with normal cognitive function (MoCA score = 26) in control group. Information of history of disease, family history, data of BMI, WHR, HbA1c, FINS, C-Peptide (C-P), SBP, DBP, blood lipid (TG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C and carotid ultrasound (carotid IMT, carotid resistance index [RI]) was collected.RESULTS: There were significant differences in the rate of patients with hypertension ([40.63 vs. 58.06%], P=0.026), duration of diabetes mellitus ([3.09 ± 4.04 y vs. 4.80 ± 4.94 y], P=0.024), C-P ([2.79 ± 1.09 ng/ml vs. 2.26 ± 1.00 ng/ml], P=0.008), Max C-IMT ([0.81 ± 0.15 mm vs. 0.91 ± 0.15 mm], P&lt;0.001), Min C-RI (0.71 ± 0.06 vs. 0.68 ± 0.06, P&lt;0.05), and no significant differences in the duration of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, BMI, WHR, HbA1c, SBP, DBP and blood lipid between control group and MCI group. MoCA scores were positively correlated with C-P (r=0.252, P=0.005), and negatively correlated with the history of hypertension (r=-0.244, P=0.002), duration of DM (r=-0.161, P=0.044), Max C-IMT (r=-0.253, P=0.005) and Min C-RI (r=-0.183, P=0.023). Multiple regression analysis showed that history of hypertension (Beta=-0.267, P=0.002), C-P (Beta=0.281, P=0.001) and Min C-RI (Beta=-0.221, P=0.011) were significantly independent determinants for the MoCA scores.CONCLUSIONS: The longer duration of diabetes, history of hypertension, lower serum C-P levels, thickened C-IMT and higher C-RI could be risk factors of MCI in type 2 diabetic patients. This finding could have an important impact on the management of cognitive decline in diabetic patients."
"22424621","Hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance and cognitive decline in older cohort.","OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes has been recently recognized as an important risk factor for cognitive decline of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). But the roles of hyperinsulinemia (HI) and insulin resistance (IR) in the development of AD are still controversial. This study was designed to evaluate whether HI or IR influenced the cognitive functions of older cohort.METHODS: The cognitive functions of 328 consecutive elderly patients were evaluated with a battery of cognitive rating scales. Their fasting blood glucose (FBG) and fasting insulin (FINS) were analyzed and IR was calculated with modified-Homa. The cognitive scores in different groups and the correlation of cognitive functions with HI or IR were analyzed.RESULTS: In our study, there were 180 participants with HI and 148 without HI, and 192 with IR and 136 without IR. The participants with HI showed worse cognitive functions than those without HI in MMSE, MOCA, CDR, orientation, delayed memory, and attention/calculation domains. Similarly, the elderly with IR had lower cognitive scores than those without IR in MMSE, MOCA, CDR, GDS, orientation, delayed memory, and attention/calculation domains. The insulin levels and Homa IR had negative correlation with the scores of MMSE and delayed memory, not only in the model 1 adjusted for FBG and diabetes history, but also in the model 2 adjusted for all nine demographic characteristics.CONCLUSION: HI and IR are important risk factors for cognitive decline of the elderly, especially for the dysfunctions in delayed memory domains."
"22333102","[Correlations among metabolic syndrome and mild cognitive impairment].","OBJECTIVE: To determine the correlations between metabolic syndrome (MS), its individual components and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).METHODS: We selected 168 MS patients and 150 healthy control subjects from our hospital from June 2009 to June 2010. Socio-demographic characteristic data including gender, age, education level, height, weight waist circumference and blood pressure, past history of coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and unhealthy habit of smoking and drinking, were investigated. The patient levels of fasting plasma glucose, fast insulin glycated, hemoglobin and blood lipids were measured on the next day. All subjects were evaluated with regards to the scores of Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), clinical memory scale (CMS), daily living skills assessment (ADL) and Hamilton depression scale (HAMD).RESULT: (1) MCI was more frequently detected in MS subjects than that in the healthy controls (24.4% vs 1.2%); (2)the scores of general MoCA and several parts of MoCA were lower in the MS subjects (scores of general 26.8 ± 0.5, EF4.40 ± 0.04, NAM2.60 ± 0.06, MEM3.60 ± 0.20, ATT5.60 ± 0.09, LANG2.60 ± 0.08, ABS1.50 ± 0.10, ORT5.40 ± 0.13)than those of the controls (scores of general 27.6 ± 0.4, EF4.50 ± 0.05, NAM2.70 ± 0.08, MEM4.20 ± 0.11, ATT5.70 ± 0.08, LANG2.60 ± 0.09, ABS1.60 ± 0.07, ORT5.40 ± 0.10). No statistically significant differences existed in the scores of general MoCA and several parts except for memory and abstract (P &gt; 0.05). The scores of general CMS and several parts of CMS were lower in the MS subjects (scores of general 72 ± 8, memory function reflected in memory 14 ± 2, associating study 14 ± 3, free image memory 14 ± 4, recognition of meaningless figure 16 ± 3, recollection ability of human figure 14 ± 3) than those in the controls (scores of general 85 ± 7, memory function reflected in memory 16 ± 2,associating study 16 ± 3, free image memory 17 ± 3, recognition of meaningless figure 18 ± 3, recollection ability of human figure 17 ± 3). And the differences had statistical significance (P &lt; 0.05); (3) a high degree of education was a protective factor of MCI (OR = 0.512, P = 0.011) while diabetes, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome were the independent risk factors of MCI (OR(1) = 4.240, P(1) = 0.014; OR(2) = 7.230, P(2) = 0.023; OR(3) = 8.620, P(3) = 0.001).CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome are the independent risk factors of MCI."

"23982512","Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are associated with cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetic adults.","Hypovitaminosis D is highly prevalent in type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study is to determine the serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] in type 2 diabetic patients with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and examine the relationship of 25(OH)D and MCI with other clinical factors. One hundred and sixty-five diabetic patients were enrolled in this study. Among whom, 95 patients were considered as MCI [Montreal Cognitive Assessment score (MoCA) &lt; 26] and the other 70 as no MCI (MoCA = 26). Subjects were assessed clinically. Diabetic patients with MCI had a longer duration of DM, fewer years of education, elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), resistant index (RI) of carotid, and lower levels of 25(OH)D {[17.35 (13.02-25.92) vs 28.00 (19.67-34.30)] ng/ml, P &lt; 0.001}. The MoCA score was positively correlated with log10[25(OH)D], education year, and inversely correlated with duration of DM, history of hypertension, intima-media thickness (IMT), FBG, max-RI, and min-RI. Log10[25(OH)D] was positively correlated with MoCA score, and inversely correlated with IMT, in multivariate regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, and education year, 25(OH)D (ß = 0.210, P = 0.003), history of hypertension (ß = -0.191, P = 0.007), IMT (ß = -0.194, P = 0.007), and FBG (ß = -0.157, P = 0.026) independently predicted MoCA score. In conclusion, our results suggest that levels of serum 25(OH)D are inversely associated with the cognitive impairment in diabetic patients. Vitamin D may be a potential protective factor for cognitive impairment in patients with type 2 diabetes."
"23978069","Relationships among serum C-reactive protein, receptor for advanced glycation products, metabolic dysfunction, and cognitive impairments.","BACKGROUND: We examined the clinical value of two serum markers of low-grade inflammation, C-reactive protein (CRP) and receptor of advanced glycation products (RAGE), as prognostic indices for cognitive decline.METHODS: Patients with cognitive impairment (n = 377) and controls (n = 66) were examined by blood biochemistry tests, including ELISAs of serum CRP and RAGE, the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and STEAM 1H-MRS of the left hippocampus and thalamus.RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the cognitive impairment group was older (63.10 ± 9.70 years vs. 55.09 ± 10.77 years, P = 0.000) and had fewer years of formal education (9.01 ± 4.01 vs. 12.94 ± 3.0, P = 0.000). There were no significant differences in the frequencies of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia between groups. Serum CRP and RAGE were higher in the cognitive impairment group (CRP: 2.08 mg/L, range 1.07 - 3.36 mg/L vs. 0.21 mg/L, range 0.18 - 0.42 mg/L; RAGE: 4.01, range 2.49 - 5.71, vs. 2.28, range 1.84 - 3.03; P &lt; 0.05 for both). In patients with cognitive impairment, there were negative correlations between cognitive function (as measured by MMSE and MoCA) and both CRP and RAGE levels (P &lt; 0.05). Patients over 55 years exhibited a positive correlation between CRP and myo-inositol peak area in the left hippocampus (P &lt; 0.05), while there was no relationship between RAGE and any metabolite (P &gt; 0.05). Multiple linear regression revealed that CRP was influenced by hypertension (P = 0.026) and cognitive impairment (P = 0.042).CONCLUSIONS: Chronic low-grade inflammation is present in patients with cognitive impairment. Serum CRP, RAGE, and left hippocampal myo-inositol may provide prognostic information on cognitive decline."
"23936778","Montreal Cognitive Assessment is superior to Standardized Mini-Mental Status Exam in detecting mild cognitive impairment in the middle-aged and elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","AIM: This study compares the usefulness of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to Standardized Mini-Mental Status Exam (SMMSE) for diagnosing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) population.METHODS: This prospective pilot study enrolled 30 community dwelling adults with Type 2 DM aged 50 years and above. Subjects were assessed using both the SMMSE and MoCA for MCI. In all subjects, depression and dementia were ruled out using the DSM IV criteria, and a functional assessment was done. MCI was diagnosed using the standard test, the European consortium criteria. Sensitivity and specificity analysis, positive and negative predictive values, likelihood ratios and Kappa statistic were calculated.RESULTS: In comparison to consortium criteria, the sensitivity and specificity of MoCA were 67% and 93% in identifying individuals with MCI, and SMMSE were 13% and 93%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values for MoCA were 84% and 56%, and for SMMSE were 66% and 51%, respectively. Kappa statistics showed moderate agreement between MoCA and consortium criteria (kappa = 0.4) and a low agreement between SMMSE and consortium criteria (kappa = 0.07).CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, MoCA appears to be a better screening tool than SMMSE for MCI in the diabetic population."
"23845902","Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and other risk factors of mild cognitive impairment among Chinese type 2 diabetic patients.","OBJECTIVE: To identify some risk factors of MCI among patients with type 2 diabetes(T2DM) and to find if there is any correlation between these factors and the degree of cognitive decline.METHODS: A total of 155 patients with T2DM referred to the Department of Endocrinology at First Hospital of Qinhuangdao were enrolled. To assess MCI the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scoring system was used. There were 66 patients with MCI and 89 patients without MCI (control). HbAlc, blood lipid, liver and renal functions were measured in all subjects.RESULTS: Compared with the control group, type 2 diabetic patients with MCI had a longer duration of diabetes; higher non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), triglycerides, total cholesterol, HbA1c, and BMI; and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (P&lt;0.05). The rates of patients with a history of habitual light-to-moderate alcohol consumption, a high proportion of Mediterranean-type diet, and regular physical activity were lower; and the rate of current smoking was higher in type 2 diabetic patients with MCI than the control group (P&lt;0.05). Among patients with MCI, the results indicated that MoCA score was negatively correlated with non-HDL-C (r=-0.761 P&lt;0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that non-HDL-C can act as a readily available method for estimating risk of MCI in Chinese type 2 diabetic patient in routine clinical practice. Good lifestyle likely reduces MCI risk in diabetic patients."

Diabetes is associated with cognitive impairment in older people. However, the link between elevated GA/HbA1c levels and the risk of cognitive impairment in nondiabetic individuals is unclear.METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 474 old, nondiabetic adults (192 women, mean age 73.8 years ± 6.9 SD) who had been admitted to our hospital was conducted. Glycemic measures included fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour post-prandial plasmic glucose (2hPPG), GA and HbA1c. Cognitive function was assessed using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at the same examination visit in which the glycemic measures were determined.RESULTS: When the individuals were divided into two groups according to the median of GA/HbA1c ratio, old adults with GA/HbA1c ratio = 2.53 showed lower MMSE and MoCA scores compared to those with GA/HbA1c ratio<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>2.53. Univariate regression analysis showed that MMSE and MoCA scores were not correlated with HbA1c, but were inversely correlated with GA and GA/HbA1c ratio. Linear regression analysis revealed that there was a significant negative correlation between GA/HbA1c and cognitive function (ß = -0.77, P &lt; 0.01 for MoCA and ß = -0.69, P &lt; 0.05 for MMSE) even after adjustment for age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, lipoprotein(a) and sex.CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that even in the absence of manifest type 2 diabetes mellitus, GA/HbA1c ratio levels exert a negative influence on cognition and it may be a better predictor for cognitive impairment in the older population."
"25323981","Kidney disease and cognitive function: African American-diabetes heart study MIND.","AIMS: Albuminuria and reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are linked with poorer cognitive performance in European-ancestry populations with advanced nephropathy; relationships in African Americans (AAs) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are less clear. Tests of cognitive performance, urine albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR), and CKD-EPI eGFR were performed in unrelated AAs with T2D to determine relationships.METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of 263 unrelated AAs with T2D recruited in the African American-Diabetes Heart Study (AA-DHS) MIND. Global cognitive function (mini-mental state exam [3MSE] and Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]), memory (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test [RAVLT]), executive function (Stroop, verbal fluency for animals, and Digit Symbol Copy [DSC]), UACR, and eGFR were determined. Relationships between cognitive tests and renal parameters were assessed using multivariate models, adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, hemoglobin A1c, level of education, hypertension, and LDL cholesterol.RESULTS: Participants had a mean ± SD age of 60.2 ± 9.7 years, 62.7% were female, T2D duration was 14.3 ± 8.9 years, eGFR 86.0 ± 23.2 ml/min/1.73 m(2), and UACR 155.8 ± 542.1 (median 8.1) mg/g. In adjusted models, higher UACR was associated with worse 3MSE (p = 0.014), MoCA (p = 0.0089), DSC (p = 0.0004), Stroop performance time (p = 0.003), Stroop errors (p = 0.032), and Stroop interference (p = 0.026). Higher eGFR was associated with better performance on DSC (p = 0.0071).CONCLUSIONS: In AAs with T2D, albuminuria and eGFR were associated with cognitive function, even in mild kidney disease. These data stress the need for interventions to prevent cognitive decline well before the late stages of kidney disease."

Amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) were computed from fMRI signals to measure spontaneous neuronal activity. Differences in the ALFF patterns between patients and controls, as well as their correlations with clinical variables, were evaluated.RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, T2DM patients exhibited significantly decreased ALFF values mainly in the frontal and parietal lobes, the bilateral thalumi, the posterior lobe of the cerebellum, and increased ALFF values mainly in the visual cortices. Furthermore, lower ALFF values in the left subcallosal gyrus correlated with lower ankle-brachial index values (r = 0.481, p = 0.020), while lower ALFF values in the bilateral medial prefrontal gyri correlated with higher urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (r =<U+200A> -0.418, p = 0.047). In addition, most of the regions with increased ALFF values in the visual cortices were found to negatively correlate with MoCA scores.CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that ALFF are altered in many brain regions in T2DM patients, and this is associated with the presence of diabetic vascular disease and poor cognitive performance. These findings may provide additional insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms that mediate T2DM-related cognitive dysfunction, and may also serve as a reference for future research."
"25220803","Cognitive and affective functions in diabetic patients associated with diabetes-related factors, white matter abnormality and aging.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with a decline in cognitive and affective functions.METHODS: In all, 182 outpatients with DM were investigated for associations of cognitive and affective functions with diabetes-related factors and cerebral white matter abnormalities. In addition, the difference in cognitive decline of age-matched late elderly normal subjects and DM patients was investigated.RESULTS: The present study revealed that cognitive and affective functions declined in some DM patients. Furthermore, the decline in these functions was unrelated to fasting blood sugar level but was related to glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and insulin resistance. Poor HbA1c control was associated with a significant decline in the 'calculation' subscale and insulin resistance for 'naming', 'read list of letters' and 'delayed recall' Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) subscale scores. Magnetic resonance imaging scans showed that both periventricular hyperintensity (PVH) and deep white matter hyperintensity were associated with Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and MoCA scores, but only PVH was related to homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance scores. Compared with age-matched late elderly normal subjects, 'orientation to time' and 'registration' MMSE subscales declined in late elderly DM patients.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that cognitive and affective decline in DM patients was mostly related to glucose control and insulin resistance, whilst amongst late elderly subjects the impairment of 'attention' and 'orientation' were characteristic features of DM patients."
"25066497","A comparison of neuropsychological performance between US and Russia: preparing for a global clinical trial.","BACKGROUND: Understanding regional differences in cognitive performance is important for interpretation of data from large multinational clinical trials.METHODS: Data from Durham and Cabarrus Counties in North Carolina, USA and Tomsk, Russia (n = 2972) were evaluated. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Trail Making Test Part B (Trails B), Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Word List Memory Test (WLM) delayed recall, and self-report Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Studies Mail-In Cognitive Function Screening Instrument (MCFSI) were administered at each site. Multilevel modeling measured the variance explained by site and predictors of cognitive performance.RESULTS: Site differences accounted for 11% of the variation in the MoCA, 1.6% in Trails B, 1.7% in WLM, and 0.8% in MCFSI scores. Prior memory testing was significantly associated with WLM. Diabetes and stroke were significantly associated with Trails B and MCFSI.CONCLUSIONS: Sources of variation include cultural differences, health conditions, and exposure to test stimuli. Findings highlight the importance of local norms to interpret test performance."
"24876438","Autonomy of patients with type 2 diabetes with an insulin pump device: is it predictable?","BACKGROUND: Insulin pump therapy may be offered to patients with type 2 diabetes that is not controlled by multiple daily injections. Patients with type 2 diabetes may suffer from unrecognized cognitive disabilities, which may compromise the use of a pump device.METHODS: To predict patient autonomy, we evaluated 39 patients with type 2 diabetes from our database (n = 143) after continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) initiation using (1) an autonomy questionnaire evaluating the patient's cognitive and operative capacities for CSII utilization, (2) the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) for the detection of mild cognitive disabilities, (3) the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) for the detection of anxiety and depression, and (4) the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ). Patients were selected to constitute 3 groups matched for age, with different degrees of autonomy at discharge after the initial training program: complete (n = 13), partial (n = 13), or no autonomy (n = 13).RESULTS: The satisfaction level with the pump device was high. At the last follow-up visit, only 23% of patients did not reach complete autonomy. The autonomy score correlated fairly with the MOCA score (R = 0.771, P &lt; .001). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that at a cut-off score of 24, the MOCA identified autonomous versus dependent patients at long-term follow-up (area under the ROC curve [AUC], 0.893; sensitivity, 81%; specificity, 81%). The HADS correlated negatively with the autonomy score, and the sociocultural level also influenced autonomy with pump utilization.CONCLUSION: Patients with type 2 diabetes with partial autonomy at discharge may progress to complete autonomy. The MOCA and HADS may help predict a patient's ability to manage with a pump device."

"24746932","Comparisons of cognitive function and serum S-100B level between diabetic and non-diabetic patients after the implantation of carotid artery stent (CAS).","To investigate cognitive function improvement in diabetic and non-diabetic patients after the implantation of Carotid Artery Stent (CAS), 128 patients suffering severe carotid stenosis were successfully enrolled in this study. Tests including, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), Clock Drawing Test (CDT), Hasegawa's Dementia Scale-Revised (HDS-R) and the serum levels of S-100B, were all measured at baseline for 3 months after the implantation of CAS. The baseline characteristics were similar between the patients with and without diabetes. 3 months after the implantation, significant improvements in MMSE (24.8 ± 2.2 vs. 25.2 ± 2.1, p=0.003), MoCA (25.6 ± 2.0 vs. 26.1 ± 1.9, p=0.000), ADAS-Cog (6.5 ± 1.3 vs. 6.1 ± 1.3, p=0.000), and CDT (3.3 ± 0.7 vs. 3.5 ± 0.7, p=0.034) were observed in the non-diabetic group. In contrast, there was no significant improvement in any of the cognitive test for the diabetic group. Another interesting discovery was the CAS procedure significantly decreased the S-100B level in the non-diabetic group (0.11 ± 0.04 ng/mL vs. 0.10 ± 0.04 ng/mL, p=0.000), but similar phenomena were not discovered in the diabetic group. In this light, the change of the S-100B level was negatively correlated with the results in the MMSE (p&lt;0.01) and the MoCA (p&lt;0.01) tests, and positively correlated with the result in ADAS-Cog (p&lt;0.05) test. Our findings suggest that the CAS-induced beneficial effects on cognitive function might have a correlation relationship with the serum level of S-100B."
"24577459","Post-stroke cognitive impairment: high prevalence and determining factors in a cohort of mild stroke.","BACKGROUND: Because of the aging population and a rise in the number of stroke survivors, the prevalence of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) is increasing.OBJECTIVE: To identify the factors associated with 3-month PSCI.METHODS: All consecutive stroke patients without pre-stroke dementia, mild cognitive disorders, or severe aphasia hospitalized in the Neurology Department of Dijon, University Hospital, France (November 2010 - February 2012) were included in this prospective cohort study. Demographics, vascular risk factors, and stroke data were collected. A first cognitive evaluation was performed during the hospitalization using the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA). Patients assessable at 3 months were categorized as cognitively impaired if the MMSE score was =26/30 and MOCA &lt;26/30 or if the neuropsychological battery confirmed PSCI when the MMSE and MOCA were discordant. Multivariable logistic models were used to determine factors associated with 3-month PSCI.RESULTS: Among the 280 patients included, 220 were assessable at 3 months. The overall frequency of 3-month PSCI was 47.3%, whereas that of dementia was 7.7%. In multivariable analyses, 3-month PSCI was associated with age, low education level, a history of diabetes mellitus, acute confusion, silent infarcts, and functional handicap at discharge. MMSE and MOCA scores during hospitalization were associated with 3-month PSCI (OR = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.54-0.74; p &lt; 0.0001 and OR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.59-0.76; p &lt; 0.0001, respectively).CONCLUSION: Our study underlines the high frequency of PSCI in a cohort of mild stroke. The early cognitive diagnosis of stroke patients could be useful by helping physicians to identify those at a high risk of developing PSCI."
"24434688","Gray matter volume abnormalities in type 2 diabetes mellitus with and without mild cognitive impairment.","This study sought to evaluate the potential brain gray matter (GM) volume changes that occur with the transition from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). VBM analyses of brain GM based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were performed on 28 T2DM patients with MCI, 25 T2DM patients without MCI, 28 MCI patients and 29 healthy controls (HC). Compared with the HC, the T2DM patients both with and without MCI showed significantly decreased total GM volume. Furthermore, the VBM results indicated that the T2DM patients without MCI exhibited extensively decreased GM volume compared with the HC in certain brain regions, including the superior and middle temporal gyrus (MTG), the superior and medial frontal gyrus and the middle occipital gyrus. In addition to more extensive GM atrophy in the aforementioned brain regions, the medial temporal lobe also exhibited GM loss in the T2DM patients with MCI. Furthermore, relative to the patients without MCI, only the left MTG exhibited a lower GM volume in the T2DM patients with MCI, which was positively correlated with the total MoCA score (r=0.699, P&lt;0.01). Finally, relative to MCI, the left MTG atrophy was also found in the T2DM patients with MCI. Our findings suggest that MTG atrophy was associated with an increased risk for MCI in T2DM patients. The brain structural changes in many brain regions may underlie the transition from normal cognition to MCI in T2DM patients. "

"26618003","Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Modified Mini Mental State Examination in African Americans.","Background. Sparse data limit the interpretation of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores, particularly in minority populations. Additionally, there are no published data on how MoCA scores compare to the widely used Modified Mini Mental State Examination (3MSE). We provide performance data on the MoCA in a large cohort of African Americans and compare 3MSE and MoCA scores, providing a &quot;crosswalk&quot; for interpreting scores. Methods. Five hundred and thirty African Americans with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in African American-Diabetes Heart Study-MIND, a cross-sectional study of cognition and structural and functional brain imaging. After excluding participants with possible cognitive impairment (n = 115), mean (SD) MoCA and 3MSE scores are presented stratified by age and education. Results. Participant mean age was 58.2 years (range: 35-83); 61% were female; and 64.9% had &gt;12 years of education. Mean (SD) 3MSE and MoCA scores were 86.9 (8.2) and 19.8 (3.8), respectively. 93.5% of the cohort had a &quot;positive&quot; screen on the MoCA, scoring &lt;26 (education-adjusted), compared with 47.5% on the 3MSE (cut-point &lt; 88). A 3MSE score of 88 corresponded to a MoCA score of 20 in this population. Conclusion. The present data suggest the need for caution when applying proposed MoCA cutoffs to African Americans. "
"26578953","C-Reactive Protein, Advanced Glycation End Products, and Their Receptor in Type 2 Diabetic, Elderly Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate serum levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to determine the predictors (including AGEs, RAGE, and CRP levels) of having MCI in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes.METHODS: Two hundred seventy-six diabetics elders were screened for MCI (using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment: MoCA score). Data of biochemical parameters and biomarkers were collected.RESULTS: Serum AGEs, RAGE, and CRP levels were significantly increased in MCI patients compared to controls. In group of patients with MCI, serum RAGE level was positively correlated with AGEs level and with CRP level. RAGE, AGEs, and CRP concentrations were positively correlated with HbA1c levels and negatively correlated with MoCA score. The univariate logistic regression models revealed that variables, which increased the likelihood of diagnosis of MCI in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes were higher levels of HbA1c, RAGE, AGEs, CRP, TG, lower level of HDL cholesterol, previous CVD, HA, or use of HA drugs, hyperlipidemia, retinopathy, nephropathy, increased number of co-morbidities, older age, and less years of formal education. HA or use of HA drugs, previous CVD, higher level of RAGE and CRP, older age and less years of formal education are the factors increasing the likelihood of having MCI in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes in multivariable model.CONCLUSION: In summary, serum AGEs, RAGE, and CRP are increased in the circulation of MCI elderly diabetic patients compared to controls. A larger population-based prospective study needs to be performed to further confirm the relationship between AGEs, RAGE, and the cognitive decline or progress to dementia."
"26578946","Complex network analysis of resting state EEG in amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients with type 2 diabetes.","PURPOSE: Diabetes is a great risk factor for dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study investigates whether complex network-derived features in resting state EEG (rsEEG) could be applied as a biomarker to distinguish amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) from normal cognitive function in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D).METHOD: In this study, EEG was recorded in 28 patients with T2D (16 aMCI patients and 12 controls) during a no-task eyes-closed resting state. Pair-wise synchronization of rsEEG signals were assessed in six frequency bands (delta, theta, lower alpha, upper alpha, beta, and gamma) using phase lag index (PLI) and grouped into long distance (intra- and inter-hemispheric) and short distance interactions. PLI-weighted connectivity networks were also constructed, and characterized by mean clustering coefficient and path length. The correlation of these features and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores was assessed.RESULTS: Main findings of this study were as follows: (1) In comparison with controls, patients with aMCI had a significant decrease of global mean PLI in lower alpha, upper alpha, and beta bands. Lower functional connection at short and long intra-hemispheric distance mainly appeared on the left hemisphere. (2) In the lower alpha band, clustering coefficient was significantly lower in aMCI group, and the path length significantly increased. (3) Cognitive status measured by MoCA had a significant positive correlation with cluster coefficient and negative correlation with path length in lower alpha band.CONCLUSIONS: The brain network of aMCI patients displayed a disconnection syndrome and a loss of small-world architecture. The correlation between cognitive states and network characteristics suggested that the more in deterioration of the diabetes patients' cognitive state, the less optimal the network organization become. Hence, the complex network-derived biomarkers based on EEG could be employed to track cognitive function of diabetic patients and provide a new diagnosis tool for aMCI."
"26566043","Blood Biomarkers Associated with Cognitive Decline in Early Stage and Drug-Naive Parkinson's Disease Patients.","Early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) continues to be a major challenge in the field. The lack of a robust biomarker to detect early stage PD patients has considerably slowed the progress toward the development of potential therapeutic agents. We have previously evaluated several RNA biomarkers in whole blood from participants enrolled in two independent clinical studies. In these studies, PD patients were medicated, thus, expression of these biomarkers in de novo patients remains unknown. To this end, we tested ten RNA biomarkers in blood samples from 99 untreated PD patients and 101 HC nested in the cross-sectional Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative by quantitative real-time PCR. One biomarker out of ten, COPZ1 trended toward significance (nominal p = 0.009) when adjusting for age, sex, and educational level. Further, COPZ1, EFTUD2 and PTBP1 mRNAs correlated with clinical features in PD patients including the Hoehn and Yahr scale, Movement Disorder Society revision of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score. Levels of EFTUD2 and PTBP1 were significantly higher in cognitively normal PD patients (PD-CN) compared to cognitively impaired PD patients (PD-MCI). Interestingly, blood glucose levels were significantly higher in PD and PD-MCI patients (= 100 mg/dL, pre-diabetes) compared to HC. Collectively, we report the association of three RNA biomarkers, COPZ1, EFTUD2 and PTBP1 with clinical features including cognitive decline in early drug-naïve PD patients. Further, our results show that drug-naïve PD and PD-MCI patients have glucose levels characteristic of pre-diabetes patients, suggesting that impaired glucose metabolism is an early event in PD. Evaluation of these potential biomarkers in a larger longitudinal study is warranted. "
"26530222","Relationship between glycated hemoglobin A1c and cognitive function in nondemented elderly patients with type 2 diabetes.","Elderly patients with type 2 diabetes are at a greater risk for cognitive decline. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between the degree of hyperglycemia and cognitive status in nondemented, elderly diabetics. Between Jan 2013 and Dec 2014, 1174 geriatric patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in the study (579 males; age = 60 years; from Fuzhou, Fujian, China). Cognitive function was measured with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). A statistically significant, age-adjusted association was observed between the A1C levels and the scores on two cognitive tests (MMSE and MoCA). Specifically, a 1% higher A1C value was associated with a 0.21-point lower MMSE score (95% CI; compare -0.11 to -0.28; P &lt; 0.0001), as well as a 0.11-point lower MoCA score (95% CI; compare -0.10 to -0.38; P &lt; 0.0001). Higher A1C levels were not significantly associated with lower MMSE and MoCA test scores after adjusting for all variables. No significant correlation was found between the two variables in patients older than 80 years of age (n = 215; OR = 1.019; 95% CI = 0.968 - 1.099; p = 0.251). Evidence strongly suggests that chronic hyperglycemia is associated with a decline in cognitive function in nondemented elderly patients with type 2 diabetes. When cognitive assessments are made, comprehensive factors such as advanced age, education level, duration of diabetes, hypertension and other vascular risks should be taken into account. For older geriatric patients (age = 80 years), there is no significant correlation between A1c levels and cognitive function."

Recent experimental and clinical studies showed that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Parkinson's disease (PD) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) share several dysregulated pathways.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether genome-wide significant loci of T2DM are associated with the risk of PD and AD as well as the severity of cognitive impairment.METHODS: Study subjects were 500 PD patients, 400 AD patients, and 500 unrelated controls. We selected 32 genetic variants from 11 genes (CDC123, CDKAL1, CDKN2B, FTO, GLIS3, HHEX, IGF2BP2, KCNJ11, KCNQ1, SLC30A8, and TCF7L2) and intergenic regions based on results of recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in T2DM. These variants were reported to be T2DM-susceptibility loci and have been replicated in other independent studies. All association analyses were performed using logistic regression models, adjusting for age and sex.RESULTS: KCNQ1 SNP rs163182 showed the strongest association with AD, but it was not significant after Bonferroni correction (OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.07-1.59, Pcorrected = 0.32). In PD patients, CDC123 SNP rs11257655 showed modest association with MMSE score &lt;26, and CDKN2B SNPs (rs2383208, rs10965250, and rs10811661) showed modest association with MoCA score &lt;26, which were not significant after Bonferroni correction. Other genetic variants had no association with the risk of PD or AD and the severity of cognitive impairment.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that genome-wide significant loci of T2DM play no major role in the risk and cognitive impairment of PD and AD."

"26169667","Cognitive function and left ventricular assist device implantation.","BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is frequent in patients with heart failure (HF) and can lead to poor quality of life and increased risk of mortality. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a simple screening tool that is sensitive to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and that has been validated in the settings of neurologic and cardiovascular disease. This study determined the extent of cognitive impairment in patients with HF undergoing evaluation for advanced surgical therapy and evaluated changes in MoCA score with follow-up cognitive assessment at 8 months after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation.METHODS: As part of routine assessment for LVAD candidacy, 176 patients with advanced HF were administered the MoCA; 56 patients were reevaluated 8 months after LVAD implantation.RESULTS: Patients with MCI, indicated by MoCA score &lt;26 out of 30, made up 67% of the study cohort. MCI was associated with significantly older age, higher CHADS2 (congestive HF, hypertension, age &gt;75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack) risk score, statin use, history of stroke and hypertension, and reduced serum cholesterol levels. In 56 patients who underwent follow-up evaluation after LVAD implantation, total MoCA score and visuospatial, executive, and delayed recall cognitive domains were significantly improved.CONCLUSIONS: This study assessed the use of the MoCA in patients with end-stage HF being evaluated for advanced surgical therapy. We found the MoCA to be a rapid, simple, and powerful tool for detecting cognitive impairment in these patients. MCI was highly prevalent in the cohort. Significant improvement in overall MoCA score was noted after LVAD implantation."

Methods. 219 diabetics elders were screened for psychiatric disorders and divided: group 1, MCI without depressive mood; group 2, MCI with depressive mood; group 3, controls. Data of biochemical parameters and biomarkers were collected. Results. In groups 1 and 2 levels of all biomarkers were significantly higher as compared to controls. The highest level of hs-CRP and sICAM-1 was detected in group 2. SVCAM-1 and sE-selectin levels were also the highest in group 2; however they did not significantly differ as compared to group 1. MoCA score was negatively correlated with all biomarkers in group 1. The logistic regression model showed that variables which increased the likelihood of having depressive syndrome in MCI patients were older age, stroke, neuropathy, increased number of comorbidities, and higher sICAM-1 level. Conclusions. We first demonstrated that elderly diabetic patients with MCI, particularly those with depressive mood have higher levels of soluble adhesion molecules and markers of low-grade systemic inflammation. Coexisting depressive syndrome in patients with MCI through common inflammatory pathways may result in augmentation of psychiatric disorders. "

Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation criteria. Cognition was evaluated by the use of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Multivariate logistic regression models estimated the association between metabolic syndrome and each of its components with cognitive performance.RESULTS: A total of 212 persons (mean age: 69.2 ± 7.2 years, 64 % women) were enrolled. Of these, 120 (57 %) had metabolic syndrome. Mean scores in the MoCA were 18.2 ± 4.6 for persons with and 19 ± 4.7 for those without metabolic syndrome. In fully adjusted logistic models, MoCA scores were not associated with metabolic syndrome (p = 0.101). After testing individual components of metabolic syndrome with the MoCA score, we found that only hypertriglyceridemia was independently associated with the MoCA score (p = 0.009).CONCLUSIONS: This population-based study showed a poor correlation of metabolic syndrome with cognitive performance after adjusting for relevant confounders. Of the individual components of metabolic syndrome, only hypertriglyceridemia correlated with worse cognitive performance."

However, the potential influence of CAS on cognitive function in patients with carotid artery stenosis and cerebral lacunar infarction has not been determined. This study investigated changes in cognitive function associated with CAS and the factors related to these changes.METHODS: This prospective cohort study comprised 579 Chinese patients with cerebral lacunar infarction and carotid artery stenosis for whom CAS was indicated, and a matched control group of 552 healthy individuals. Cognitive function before CAS and at scheduled intervals from 6 months to 3 years was assessed with instruments that included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale. Potential factors that might affect cognitive function were analyzed via logistic regression.RESULTS: The MMSE and MoCA scores of the patients before CAS were significantly lower than that of the control subjects. These scores were significantly higher 6 months after CAS and sustained or increased throughout the 3-year follow-up. Also significantly improved after CAS from baseline were scores for an alternating trail test, cube copying, clock-drawing, attention, and delayed recall in an auditory-verbal learning test. Logistic regression analyses showed that age greater than 65 y, little education, diabetes, and hypertension were independent risk factors for deteriorated MoCA scores 3 years after CAS.CONCLUSION: CAS was associated with significantly improved cognitive function in cerebral lacunar infarction patients with severe stenosis."
"26062587","[Diabetes and Dementia].","An aging global population is driving the current epidemic of dementia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetes is a known risk factor for the development of vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and mild cognitive impairment. Good control of diabetes may improve cognitive decline and prevent Alzheimer's disease. Mild cognitive impairment with type 2 diabetes (DM-MCI) often presents as a decline in attention, psychomotor speed, executive function, and memory. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is one of the best screening tools for detecting DM-MCI. We found that 72% of the patients admitted to educational hospitalization for type 2 diabetes could also be categorized into groups with frontal lobe dysfunction, delayed recall, and a mixed-type group. Anti-diabetic drugs and insulin may protect and improve cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and DM-MCI, but more studies are needed to verify this claim. Diabetes mellitus may be linked not only to Alzheimer's disease but also to other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's, Huntington's and frontotemporal lobe dementia. "

The patient's characteristics are collected and regression analyses were performed to predict cognitive impairments. We use MMSE and MoCA assessment as prognostic indices for cognitive impairments of patient's with stroke.OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to examine the effectiveness of the MMSE and MoCA in screening cognitive impairments.MAIN RESULTS: There were significant difference among the two groups in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (p &lt; 0.05) and intracranial atherosclerosis (p &lt; 0.05). A linear regression determined that the age, diabetes, intracranial atherosclerosis predicted the cognitive impairments. The ROC results for MoCA with an AUC of 0.882 and the corresponding results for MMSE show a similar AUC of 0.839.CONCLUSION: Neuropsychological performance of stroke patients was influenced by biological and demographic variables: age, diabetes and intracranial atherosclerosis. The MoCA and MMSE are both reliable assessments for the diagnosis of cognitive impairment after stroke."

Because of the race and different diagnosis standard, there is still no definitive conclusions.OBJECTIVE: To estimate the VRFs and potential protective factors for MCI in elderly population living in the community in North China.METHODS: A total of 3136 participants entered the study. They were screened for hypertension, coronary heart disease (CHD), and cerebrovascular disease (CVD). Cognitive function was assessed with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The diagnosis of MCI was made according to Petersen's criteria. We investigated the relationship between vascular risk factors, potential protective factors and MCI.RESULTS: A total of 2511 (80%) participant belonged to normal group and 625 (20%) participants showed MCI. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that stroke and diabetes, but not hypertension or CHD was associated with MCI. Besides, exercise habit could lower the risk of MCI.CONCLUSIONS: Vascular Risk Factors, including stroke and diabetes, rather than hypertension and CHD are independent risk factors of MCI. Involvement in physical activities seems to reduce the risk of MCI."

Shunted patients were excluded. Cerebral perfusion was measured by magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) in 46 patients with &gt;65% ICA (31 males, 64.5 ± 6.7 years) 1 week before and 6 weeks after CEA. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) 1 week before and 6 weeks after CEA.RESULTS: After CEA, perfusion parameters from PWI decreased, including mean transit time (MTT) (21.07 ± 7.36 vs. 14.27 ± 6.22, p &lt; .0001), time to peak (TTP) (28.69 ± 8.54 vs. 23.45 ± 4.25, p = .001), arrive time (T0) (19.89 ± 7.32 vs. 15.20 ± 3.51, p = .001), and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) (11.48 ± 3.50 vs. 7.53 ± 3.17, p &lt; .0001). A significant improvement was observed in MoCA (20.48 ± 1.70 vs. 22.04 ± 1.48, p = .001). Spearman's rank correlation analysis between TTP and MoCA scores demonstrated a linear relationship with an excellent correlation coefficient (R = -.893, p &lt; .001). Linear regression indicated that diabetes was a risk factor for cognitive improvement in patients with ICA (p = .014). Further analysis showed that patients with DM performed worse in MoCA after the procedure (with-DM 21.15 ± 1.28 vs. non-DM 22.4 ± 1.46, p = .010) while the baselines were similar (non-DM: 20.3 ± 1.8 vs. with-DM: 20.9 ± 1.4, p = .362).CONCLUSION: CEA could improve the cerebral perfusion and the cognitive function in un-shunted ICA patients. Cerebral reperfusion was an important factor for cognitive improvement. Diabetes had a negative effect on cognitive improvement after CEA."
"25875132","Patients with type 2 diabetes exhibit cognitive impairment with changes of metabolite concentration in the left hippocampus.","Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with cognitive dysfunction. Previous studies have reported the relationship between cerebral metabolite changes and glucose levels. However, the specific aspects of cognition that are affected by metabolic changes in T2DM- related cognitive impairment remain undetermined. In this study, 188 T2DM patients and 266 controls were recruited. Proton magnetic resonance spectra with a single voxel stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) were acquired from the left hippocampus and the frontal lobe. Presence of T2DM negatively affected the scores of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), sub-tests (i.e., attention and language) of MMSE, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) according to the Beijing version, and sub-tests (i.e., visuospatial/executive reasoning, attention, and language) of MoCA, rather than the Wechsler Memory Scale - Revised in China (WMS-RC), and all memory sub-tests contained with the MMSE and MoCA frameworks. T2DM positively affected creatine and myoinositol peak areas from the left hippocampus, rather than metabolites in the left frontal lobe. Negative correlations were shown between the left hippocampal myoinositol levels and language scores, and between the left hippocampal creatine levels and visuospatial/executive scores in T2DM. These findings suggest that T2DM may be an independent risk factor for cognitive impairment. Further, the cognitive domains of visuospatial /executive reasoning, attention and language may be predominantly impaired in the early phases of T2DM-related cognitive impairment. In addition, left hippocampal myoinositol and creatine concentrations were associated with cognitive impairment in patients with T2DM. "

Depression was evaluated with Beck's depression inventory (BDI). Cognitive functions were evaluated with Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA), paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT), spatial recall test (SRT), symbol digit modalities (SDMT), and word list generation (WLG).RESULTS: The mean gestational age, educational level and account of previous birth of the subjects in the study were not statistically different between the groups. The mean scores of BDI of the 2 groups were not statistically different. MOCA score and SDMT was significantly decreased in GDM in comparison to NP (p=0.005, p=0.04 respectively). Also, SDMT score was inversely correlated with number of pregnancies, postprandial blood glucose and HbA1c.The scores of PASAT, SRT, SPART and WLG were statistically similar between the groups.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may be a clue for early onset of impairment in cognitive functions in cases with new onset diabetes during pregnancy."
"25793613","Serum levels of inflammatory markers in depressed elderly patients with diabetes and mild cognitive impairment.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the serum levels of CRP, IL-6 and TNF-a in elderly diabetic patients with depressive syndrome alone or with coexisting mild cognitive impairment (MCI).METHODS: 276 diabetics elders were screened for depressive symptoms (using Geriatric Depression Scale: GDS-30) and MCI (using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment: MoCA score). Data of HbA1c, blood lipids and inflammatory markers levels were collected.RESULTS: In all groups of patients levels of CRP, IL-6 and TNF-a were significantly higher as compared to controls. The highest level of inflammatory markers was detected in group with depressive mood and coexisting MCI, however IL-6 level didn't significantly differ as compared to MCI group. We founded correlations between all inflammatory markers in group of patients with depressive mood and in group of subjects with depressive symptoms and coexisting MCI. GDS-30 score was correlated with levels of inflammatory markers in group with depressive mood, and with levels of CRP and TNF-a in group with depressive mood and coexisting MCI. In the group with depressive mood and coexisting MCI we founded that MoCA score was negatively correlated with CRP and TNF-a levels; and HbA1c level was positively correlated with all inflammatory markers. The univariate logistic regression models revealed that variables which increased the likelihood of having been diagnosed with MCI in depressed patients were: higher levels of HbA1c, CRP, IL-6 and TNF-a, previous CVD or stroke, increased number of co-morbidities and microvascular complications, older age, less years of formal education. The multivariable model showed that previous CVD, higher HbA1c and IL-6 levels are significant factors.CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the presence of depressive syndrome is associated with higher levels of inflammatory markers in elderly patients with diabetes. The presence of MCI in these depressed subjects has additive effect on levels of inflammatory mediators."

Their examination involved clinical, metabolic, and psychological testing. The quality of life was assessed using the general Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (MOS SF-36) and the specific Audit-Dependent Quality of Life (AdDQoL). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCa test) was employed to screen for cognitive impairments. All the patients were advised by a neurologist. Brain MRI using a 1.0 T Siemens Magnetom scanner was carried out to evaluate structural changes in the central nervous system.RESULTS: The examination of the patients with DM1 revealed the signs of grey matter atrophy, enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces, white matter injury, which correlated with the presence of chronic hyperglycemia, cognitive impairments, and microvascular complications.CONCLUSIONS: Routine brain MRI is best carried out in patients with DMI and poor disease control to timely implement therapeutic-and-prophylactic measures for preventing cognitive impairments and improving the quality of life."
"25673447","Memory dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus correlates with reduced hippocampal CA1 and subiculum volumes.","BACKGROUND: Little attention has been paid to the role of subcortical deep gray matter (SDGM) structures in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)-induced cognitive impairment, especially hippocampal subfields. Our aims were to assess the in vivo volumes of SDGM structures and hippocampal subfields using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to test their associations with cognitive performance in T2DM.METHODS: A total of 80 T2DM patients and 80 neurologically unimpaired healthy controls matched by age, sex and education level was enrolled in this study. We assessed the volumes of the SDGM structures and seven hippocampal subfields on MRI using a novel technique that enabled automated volumetry. We used Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores as measures of cognitive performance. The association of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) with SDGM structures and neuropsychological tests and correlations between hippocampal subfields and neuropsychological tests were assessed by partial correlation analysis in T2DM.RESULTS: Bilaterally, the hippocampal volumes were smaller in T2DM patients, mainly in the CA1 and subiculum subfields. Partial correlation analysis showed that the MoCA scores, particularly those regarding delayed memory, were significantly positively correlated with reduced hippocampal CA1 and subiculum volumes in T2DM patients. Additionally, higher HbA1c levels were significantly associated with poor memory performance and hippocampal atrophy among T2DM patients.CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the hippocampus might be the main affected region among the SDGM structures in T2DM. These structural changes in the hippocampal CA1 and subiculum areas might be at the core of underlying neurobiological mechanisms of hippocampal dysfunction, suggesting that degeneration in these regions could be responsible for memory impairments in T2DM patients."

The results of treatment and examination of 60 patients with type 2 diabetes diagnosis have been analyzed. The majority (49-81.6%) of patients initially exhibited light (35-71.4%) and moderate (14-28.6%) cognitive impairments. All patients received standard treatment with oral antidiabetic drugs: metformin monotherapy (26 patients or 43.3%) and combined therapy (metformin + gliclazide, 34 patients or 56.6%). In addition, 30 patients (main group) received a complex metabolic drug cytoflavin daily intravenously (10 mL in 200 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride) for 10 days with transition to the tablet form in a dose of 2 tablets (with 0.6 succinic acid, 0.1 riboxin, 0:05 nicotinamide, 0.01 riboflavin) two times a day for 25 days. The control group (n = 30) consisted of patients who received only basic hypoglycemic therapy. The inclusion of cytoflavin in the scheme of complex treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes ensured a more effective correction of cognitive impairments as compared to the group receiving basic therapy. This is confirmed by the results of neuropsychological testing (MoCA test) and improved optical and spatial activity, attention, abstract thinking, and memory on the average by 14.2% compared to the value before treatment (p &lt; 0.01) in patients of standard treatment group. Patients in the control group showed positive dynamics of same parameters amounted on the average to 7.9%.

"27733822","The Facilitative Effect of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Visuospatial Working Memory in Patients with Diabetic Polyneuropathy: A Pre-post Sham-Controlled Study.","Diabetes mellitus can lead to diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) and cognitive deficits that manifest as peripheral and central neuropathy, respectively. In this study we investigated the relationship between visuospatial working memory (VSWM) capacity and DPN severity, and attempted to improve VSWM in DPN patients via the use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Sixteen DPN patients and 16 age- and education-matched healthy control subjects received Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) for baseline cognitive assessment. A forward- and backward-recall computerized Corsi block tapping task (CBT), both with and without a concurrent motor interference task was used to measure VSWM capacity. Each DPN patient underwent a pre-treatment CBT, followed by tDCS or sham treatment, then a post-treatment CBT on two separate days. We found that although patients with severe DPN (Dyck's grade 2a or 2b) showed comparable general intelligence scores on WAIS-IV as their age- and education-matched healthy counterparts, they nonetheless showed mild cognitive impairment (MCI) on MOCA and working memory deficit on digit-span test of WAIS-IV. Furthermore, patients' peripheral nerve conduction velocity (NCV) was positively correlated with their VSWM span in the most difficult CBT condition that involved backward-recall with motor interference such that patients with worse NCV also had lower VSWM span. Most importantly, anodal tDCS over the right DLPFC was able to improve low-performing patients' VSWM span to be on par with the high-performers, thereby eliminating the correlation between NCV and VSWM. In summary, these findings suggest that (1) MCI and severe peripheral neuropathy can coexist with unequal severity in diabetic patients, (2) the positive correlation of VSWM and NCV suggests a link between peripheral and central neuropathies, and (3) anodal tDCS over the right DLPFC can improve DPN patients' VSWM, particularly for the low-performing patients."

"27404677","Mild cognitive impairment predicts death and readmission within 30days of discharge for heart failure.","BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is highly prevalent in heart failure (HF), and may be associated with short-term readmission. This study investigated the role of cognition, incremental to other clinical and non-clinical factors, independent of depression and anxiety, in predicting 30-day readmission or death in HF.METHODS: This study followed 565 patients from an Australia-wide HF longitudinal study. Cognitive function (MoCA score) together with standard clinical and non-clinical factors, mental health and 2D echocardiograms were collected before hospital discharge. The study outcomes were death and readmission within 30days of discharge. Logistic regression, Harrell's C-statistic, integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and net reclassification index were used for analysis.RESULTS: Among 565 patients, 255 (45%) had at least mild cognitive impairment (MoCA=22). Death (n=43, 8%) and readmission (n=122, 21%) within 30days of discharge were more likely to occur among patients with mild cognitive impairment (OR=2.00, p=0.001). MoCA score was also negatively associated with 30-day readmission or death (OR=0.91, p&lt;0.001) independent of other risk factors. Adding MoCA score to an existing prediction model of 30-day readmission significantly improved discrimination (C-statistic=0.715 vs. 0.617, IDI estimate 0.077, p&lt;0.001). From prediction models developed from our study, adding MoCA score (C-statistic=0.83) provided incremental value to that of standard clinical and non-clinical factors (C-statistic=0.76) and echocardiogram parameters (C-statistic=0.81) in predicting 30-day readmission or death. Reclassification analysis suggests that addition of MoCA score improved classification for a net of 12% of patients with 30-day readmission or death and of 6% of patients without (p=0.002).CONCLUSIONS: Mild cognitive impairment predicts short-term outcomes in HF, independent of clinical and non-clinical factors."

"27049362","Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) screening mild cognitive impairment in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) pre-dialysis.","INTRODUCTION: Individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at higher risk of developing cognitive impairment (CI), initially mild (MCI), potentially identifiable, but still poorly diagnosed and treated. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has been indicated for MCI screening in CKD.OBJECTIVE: To assess MCI in patients with CKD not yet on dialysis.METHODS: Study conducted in 72 non-elderly subjects with pre-dialysis CKD. The neuropsychological assessment included: The global cognitive assessment test MoCA; the clock drawing (CD); the digit span forward (DSF) and reverse (DSR); phonemic verbal (VF) fluency (FAS) and semantics (animals); the fist-edge-palm (FEP); and the memory 10 pictures.RESULTS: The average age of the participants was 56.74 ± 7.63 years, with predominance of male sex (55.6%), mainly with = 4 years of education (84.3%), with CKD cathegories 1, 2 and 3a and 3b (67.6%), hypertension (93.1%) and diabetes mellitus (52.1%). MCI (MoCA = 24) was observed in 73.6% of the patients. We did not find association among MCI with demographic and clinical variables, but a tendency to association with age (p = 0.07), educational level (p= 0.06) and diabetes (0.06). The executive function tests CD, DS-reverse and FEP, individually were able to identify CI with good sensibility and negative predictive value compared to MoCA and together, showed the same capability to identify MCI when compared to MoCA.CONCLUSION: The MCI is common in non-elderly patients with CKD not yet on dialysis. Together, the CD, DSR and FEP showed similar performance in identify MCI in this population when compared to MoCA, suggesting impairment of executive functions."

All recruited participants were =50 years of age and complained with cognitive impairment or were reported with cognitive impairment by his/her caregiver(s). MetS was diagnosed according to the criteria issued by Chinese Medical Association Diabetes Association. Cognitive function was scored by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).RESULTS: Three thousand nine hundred eighty-eight participants (in an average of 66.4<U+2009>±<U+2009>8.8 years of age, male 53.1%) were included in the analysis. Six hundred seventy-three (16.9%) participants were diagnosed with MetS, and 3013 (75.6%) participants had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (MoCA score &lt;26). There was no statistically significant difference in the MoCA scores between participants with MetS (21.0<U+2009>±<U+2009>5.4) and without MetS (21.3<U+2009>±<U+2009>5.3). In the logistic regression, after adjusting factors of age, education, marital status, smoking, and physical activity, diabetes and dyslipidemia were associated with MCI, whereas hypertension and overweight or obesity were not.

"26886083","Brain Microvasculature Involvement in ANCA Positive Vasculitis.","OBJECTIVE: Endothelial dysfunction is associated with arterial stiffness, a factor that is increasingly recognised as an important determinant of cardiovascular risk. High-flow organs such as the brain and kidneys are particularly sensitive to excessive pressure and flow pulsatility. High, local blood flow is associated with low microvascular impedance, which facilitates the penetration of excessive pulsatile energy into the microvascular bed leading to tissue damage. Systemic endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness have been demonstrated in peripheral vessels in associated vasculitis (AAV). Although, the brain involvement is not infrequent in AAV, it has not been evaluated previously. Our aim is to evaluate the involvement of the brain microvasculature in AAV.METHODS: Twenty-three patients with inactive AAV were studied. Brain blood flow was assessed by transcranial Doppler (TCD) and single-photon positron emission tomography (SPECT), structural brain involvement by brain MRI and cognitive scores by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test.RESULTS: Lower mean flow velocity (MFV) was associated to altered SPECT perfusion, higher white matter changes (WMC), lower MoCA scores and younger age (p &lt; 0.05). Middle cerebral artery pulsatility index (MCA-PI) was related to hypertension, diabetes, lower scores on MoCA, increased vasculitis damage index (VDI) and perfusion impairment in SPECT (p &lt; 0.05). These data were reproduced for all intracranial arteries. Up to 88.9% of patients had WMC on MRI. A higher lesion load was associated with age, decreased MoCA and fewer MFV with higher PI. The multivariable linear regression analysis showed that the greater the lesion loads, greater the bifrontal atrophy, MCA-PI and lower MoCA scores. Up to 60.9% of patients presented a decreased MoCA score (p = 0.012). It appeared to be related to VDI (p = 0.04), WMC (p = 0.004) and altered SPECT (p = 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The alterations in brain perfusion SPECT, the presence of white matter lesions on MRI, as well as increased PI and RI with lower MFV of the cerebral vessels in TCD suggest the presence of microangiopathy in asymptomatic AAV that could lead to cognitive impairment."

We then examined the additive effect of the TRS and brief cognitive tests to improve the diagnosis of CI.METHODS: The study was conducted in 2 primary health care centers in Singapore. A total of 1082 individuals (=60 years old) were assessed for sociodemographic risk factors and their informants were administered the AD8; 309 individuals who agreed for further cognitive assessments completed the Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and a neuropsychological battery at a research center. Primary health care medical records were accessed for data on vascular risk factors.RESULTS: Of the 309 individuals who underwent neuropsychological evaluation, 4 were excluded due to missing medical data; 167 (54.8%) individuals had CI and 138 (45.2%) had No Cognitive Impairment (NCI). The ß coefficients were standardized to calculate risk scores. CI was significantly predicted by age &gt;70 years (odds ratio [OR] 5.99; score = 3), diabetes (OR 3.36; score = 2), stroke (OR 2.70; score = 1), female gender (OR 2.02; score = 1) and individual cognitive complaints (SCC) (OR 1.95; score = 1). The TRS had an optimal cutoff of =3 and explained considerable variance in global cognitive composite Z-scores (R(2) = 0.41, P &lt; .001). The MoCA explained substantial variance compared with the MMSE and AD8 (R(2) changes of 0.474, 0.422, and 0.157, P &lt; .001, respectively).CONCLUSION: The TRS is a reasonable measure to predict individuals at risk of CI. The addition of the MoCA, in persons with positive TRS scores, is a useful approach to improve the diagnosis of CI for at-risk patients attending primary health care."

We sought to validate a recently developed predictive model of 30-day readmission or death in HF using an Australia-wide sample of patients. This study used data from 1,046 patients with HF at teaching hospitals in 5 Australian capital cities to validate a predictive model of 30-day readmission or death in HF. Besides standard clinical and administrative data, we collected data on individual sociodemographic and socioeconomic status, mental health (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ]-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder [GAD]-7 scale score), cognitive function (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] score), and 2-dimensional echocardiograms. The original sample used to develop the predictive model and the validation sample had similar proportions of patients with an adverse event within 30 days (30% vs 29%, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.35) and 90 days (52% vs 49%, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.36). Applying the predicted risk score to the validation sample provided very good discriminatory power (C-statistic<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.77) in the prediction of 30-day readmission or death. This discrimination was greater for predicting 30-day death (C-statistic<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.85) than for predicting 30-day readmission (C-statistic<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.73). There was a small difference in the performance of the predictive model among patients with either a left ventricular ejection fraction of &lt;40% or a left ventricular ejection fraction of =40%, but an attenuation in discrimination when used to predict longer-term adverse outcomes.

According to the evaluation results of MCI, these T2DM patients were further divided into the T2DM + MCI group (n = 138) and the T2DM + NMCI group (n = 122). General data, including gender, age, disease history and body mass index (BMI), and the laboratory indexes, including serum adiponectin, fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and blood fat, were collected for statistical analysis in T2DM + MCI group, T2DM + NMCI group and healthy control group.RESULTS: Comparisons among T2DM + MCI group, T2DM + NMCI group and healthy control group, showed that the serum level of adiponectin in T2DM + MCI group was significantly lower than those in remaining two groups (p &lt; 0.01). Spearman correlation analysis revealed that score of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was positively correlated with the serum level of adiponectin (r = 0.446, p &lt; 0.01). Multivariate linear regression analysis indicated that education (standard ß = 0.325, p = 0.003), age (standard ß = -0.236, p = 0.016), disease course of hypertension (standard ß = -0.242, p = 0.006), disease course of diabetes mellitus (standard ß = -0.377, p &lt; 0.001) and the level of adiponectin were correlated with the cognitive impairment. The results of itemized assessment in MoCA scale showed that in T2DM + MCI group, the scores in visuospatial and executive abilities, attention, language and orientation were significantly lower than those in other two groups (p &lt; 0.01). As for the delayed recall, the score in T2DM + MCI group was significantly lower than those in other two groups (p &lt; 0.01), while the score in T2DM + NMCI group was lower than that in the healthy control group (p &lt; 0.01); in terms of the naming ability and abstraction, no statistically significant differences were identified among three groups (p &gt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Age, poor education, disease course of hypertension, disease course of diabetes mellitus and a low level of adiponectin in serum are the risk factors in MCI of T2DM patients. Besides, the level of adiponectin in serum of T2DM patients is correlated with the development of MCI; elderly T2DM patients are afflicted by cognitive impairment, mainly in visuospatial and executive abilities, attention, language, delayed recall and orientation."

"28956423","Influence of glucose metabolism on cognitive function of patients with acute small-artery occlusion.","The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of abnormal glucose metabolism on cognitive function of patients with acute small-arterial occlusion (SAO). The present study included 1,211 patients, with small-artery occlusion according to the Trial of Org 10172 in acute stroke treatment (TOAST) classification, admitted between March 2014 and December 2016 to The Second Hospital of Jiaxing. According to cognitive function, the patients were divided into a group of normal cognitive function, a mild cognitive impairment group (MCI group) and a dementia group. The patients were also divided into normal a blood sugar group, an impaired glucose regulation group (IGR group) and a diabetes mellitus (DM) group based on glucose metabolism. Cognitive functions of patients in the different glucose metabolism groups were compared based on Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). General data, medical history, neuropsychological assessment and haematological index of the patients in each group were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was used to study independent risk factors influencing cognitive impairment. When comparing the group of normal cognitive function with the MCI group, there were no statistical significant differences between the MMSEs scores of patients among the three groups, but the difference in MoCAs scores had statistical significance. Hypertension history, hyperhomocysteinemia (Hhcy) and sedentariness were independent risk factors for SAO patients with MCI. When comparing the group of normal cognitive function with the dementia group, there were statistically significant differences (P&lt;0.05) between the MMSE and MoCA scores of patients among the three groups. Abnormal glucose metabolism, old age, female, high blood pressure, Hhcy, family stroke history and sedentariness were independent risk factors for SAO patients with dementia. In conclusion, abnormal glucose metabolism impairing cognitive function is not an independent risk factor for SAO patients with MCI, but is an independent risk factor for SAO patients with dementia."

We aim to evaluate associations between inflammatory markers and the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in T2DM. This study of 140 diabetic patients involved 71 with MCI and 69 controls. Clinical parameters, neuropsychological tests, high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), lipoprotein-associated Phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) mass and activity were measured. The results showed significantly higher plasma hsCRP, IL-6, Lp-PLA2 mass and activity in MCI group compared to controls. In T2DM with MCI, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score was positively correlated with education level and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), but inversely correlated with age, glycosylated hemoglobin, intima-media thickness (IMT), hsCRP, IL-6, and Lp-PLA2 mass and activity. Correlation analysis showed that both plasma Lp-PLA2 mass and activity were positively correlated with total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and IMT but negatively associated with MoCA score. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated higher hsCRP, Lp-PLA2 mass, Lp-PLA2 activity, and lower HDL-c to be independent risk factors increasing the possibility of MCI in T2DM. In conclusion, plasma Lp-PLA2 and hsCRP were found to be associated with the risk of MCI among T2DM patients."

MATERIAL AND METHODS In total of 385 elderly patients with chronic diseases were selected and assigned into CI and normal groups. The activities of daily living (ADL), global deterioration scale (GDS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA), patient-generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA), and mini nutritional assessment (MNA) were performed to analyze the differences between the 2 groups. Logistic regression analysis was conducted for risk factors of CI in elderly patients with chronic diseases. RESULTS There were differences in age, education level, type 2 diabetes mellitus, multifocal cerebral infarction, hearing, and eyesight between CI and normal groups. Patients in the CI group showed more CD4+ cells, more admission times, and higher GDS scores than the normal group. Also, MMSE and MoCA scores revealed differences in total score, directive force, attention and calculating ability, language, delayed memory, reading comprehension, writing, and visual-spatial ability between the 2 groups. The number of B and CD8+ cells, ADL, and MNA scores were protective factors, while cerebral infarction history, number of CD4+ cells, admission times, GDS score, and age were risk factors of CI in elderly patients with chronic diseases. CONCLUSIONS Our study provides evidence that cerebral infarction history, number of CD4+ cells, admission times, GDS score, and age are risk factors of CI in elderly patients with chronic diseases."

Demographic characteristics, clinical parameters, and neuropsychological tests were assessed. MTHFR C677T and CBS 844ins68 polymorphisms were analyzed.RESULTS: The MCI group exhibited significantly higher plasma total Hcy (tHcy) levels than control group (p<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>0.001). Plasma tHcy level was negatively correlated with MoCA scores (p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.002), but positively associated with Trail Making Test A and B scores (p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.044; p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.005, respectively). Multivariable logistic regression model showed that high tHcy level was an independent factor for MCI in T2DM patients. No significant difference was observed in the genotype or allele distributions of MTHFR and CBS between MCI and control groups. We did not find significant MCI risks in MTHFR T allele compared with C allele, and in CBS I allele compared with D allele (OR<U+200A>=<U+200A>1.361, p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.067; OR<U+200A>=<U+200A>1.048, p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.909, respectively).CONCLUSION: Increased plasma tHcy level was significantly related to T2DM-associated MCI, especially executive dysfunction.

So far, the underlying pathogenesis remains unclear. Therefore, we examined the potential relationship between cognitive impairment and three different categories of risk factors with particular focus on arterial stiffness measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV). A total of 201 chronic hemodialysis patients underwent cognitive testing under standardized conditions using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Demographic data including cardiovascular risk factors, dialysis-associated factors as well as factors related to chronic kidney disease (CKD) were analyzed. To account for arterial stiffness, PWV was measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoried with an oscillometric device that records brachial blood pressure along with pulse waves. In our cohort, 60.2% of patients showed pathological MoCA test results indicating cognitive impairment. PWV was significantly associated with cognitive impairment apart from age, educational level, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. High prevalence of cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients was confirmed. For the first time, an association between cognitive impairment and arterial stiffness was detected in a larger cohort of hemodialysis patients. Concerning the underlying pathogenesis of cognitive impairment, current results revealed a potential involvement of arterial stiffness, which has to be further evaluated in future studies."

Subjects were classified based on the presence (PD-DM) or absence of DM (PD-No DM) at baseline. Volumetric analysis was performed using FreeSurfer 5.3 image analysis suite. Brain volume and cognition were compared and analyzed cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Analyses were corrected for intracranial volume.RESULTS: There were 65 PD-no DM and 12 PD-DM subjects at baseline with comparable global cognition at baseline. PD-DM subjects had lower cortical grey matter (GM), amygdala, frontal white matter and temporal white matter volumes and higher total white matter hyperintensity and periventricular hyperintensities. After mean follow-up of 29.08months, there were 51 PD-no DM and 11 PD-DM subjects. PD-DM subjects demonstrated greater decline in MMSE and MOCA scores compared to PD-No DM. PD-DM subjects had a higher rate of atrophy in the cortical WM, particularly in the parietal and occipital white matter.CONCLUSION: Mild PD patients with DM have lower GM and WM volumes at baseline and higher WMH volumes, despite comparable cognitive scores. Longitudinally, DM in PD results in greater rate of cognitive decline, associated with higher WM atrophy."

However, the association of hypertension, diabetes and their combination with cognitive functioning is still controversial in older people. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between cognitive decline and hypertension, diabetes, and their combination in 70-year-old people based on a 3-year longitudinal analysis. Four hundred and fifty-four people aged 70 (±1) years who participated in the Japanese longitudinal cohort study of Septuagenarians, Octogenarians and Nonagenarians Investigation with Centenarians (SONIC) were recruited randomly from a general population and were monitored for 3 years. The data, including most of the demographics, cognitive functioning measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Japanese version (MoCA-J), blood pressure, blood chemistry and other medical histories, were collected at baseline and during the follow-up. The prevalence of hypertension noted in the follow-up survey was significantly higher than than noted at baseline. The mean MoCA-J score at follow-up was not significantly different from the score obtained at baseline. However, the participants with diabetes, especially combined with hypertension at baseline, had significantly lower MoCA-J scores than those without lifestyle-related diseases. The combination of hypertension and diabetes was still a significant risk factor for cognitive decline, considering the MoCA-J scores obtained during the follow-up after adjustments at baseline, relative to sex, body mass index, dyslipidemia, smoking, excessive alcohol intake, antihypertensive treatment and education level (ß=-0.14; P&lt;0.01).

Sleep duration and sleep efficiency (an indicator of sleep quality) were obtained using 7-day actigraphy recordings. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was screened using an overnight in-home monitor. Cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Three sub-scores of MoCA, visuoexecutive function, attention and delayed recall, were also analyzed.RESULTS: Mean age was 54.8 (10.2) years. OSA was diagnosed in 123 participants (76.9%). Mean sleep duration was 6.0 (1.0) h and sleep efficiency was 82.7 (8.1) %. Sleep duration and OSA severity were not related to MoCA scores. Higher sleep efficiency was associated with higher MoCA scores (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.003), and having diabetes (vs. prediabetes) was associated with lower MoCA scores (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001).

All were interviewed to obtain data regarding sociodemographic characteristics and time spent outdoors. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Beijing version (MoCA-BJ). Images of skin from UV-exposed (dorsal hand) and UV-protected (inner forearm) sites from each individual were graded by the Beagley-Gibson system. Differences in skin-grade between the 2 sites were used to indicate cumulative UV exposure level. Subjects were grouped in tertiles based on skin-grade differences (&lt;1.75, 1.75-2.74, and = 2.75), representing low, medium, and high UV exposure levels, respectively. The MoCA-BJ score was classified in tertiles as low (&lt;19), middle (19-22), and high (=23) levels of cognition.

The APOE4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease, particularly in individuals who have inherited two copies of the gene (Zhao et al., 2017). In this case study, a 38<U+202F>year old male with metabolic syndrome (MetS), the APOE4 gene, early stage memory problems and a family history of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) was placed on a ketogenic diet combined with high intensity interval training (HIIT) for 10 weeks. The primary intervention goal was reduce insulin defect, impaired cerebral and peripheral insulin signaling, associated with metabolic syndrome. Recent research demonstrates that insulin defect competes for space with APOE4 in brain cells, thus exacerbating amyloid pathology (Zhao et al., 2017). Primary biomarkers for metabolic syndrome were measured at baseline and after 10 weeks. The MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) was administered at baseline and after 10 weeks. The results were statistically significant. The HOMA-IR (homeostatic measure of insulin resistance) decreased by 59% from 4.3 to 1.8. The triglyceride/HDL ratio decreased by 77% from 14.7 to 3.4. Fasting triglycerides were reduced from 573<U+202F>mg/dL to 167<U+202F>mg/dL (71% reduction); VLDL decreased from 114.6<U+202F>mg/dL to 33.4<U+202F>mg/dL (71% decrease); and fasting insulin was reduced by 55% from 15.6 mU/L to 7.1 mU/L. The baseline MoCA score was 22/30; post treatment score was 30/30. If APOEE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for developing late-onset Alzheimer's Disease, then implementing a ketogenic diet and high intensity exercise could essentially turn &quot;off&quot; the effects of this APOE4 gene earlier in life for prevention of future neurodegeneration."
"29678606","Ketogenic diet, high intensity interval training (HIIT) and memory training in the treatment of mild cognitive impairment: A case study.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) deaths have increased by 89% since 2000. This alarming trajectory of neurological disease highlights the failure of current best practice. Deteriorating brain fuel supply is the nemesis of intact neurological health. Cerebral hypo-metabolism associated with AD occurs years before onset. Both the ketogenic diet and calorie restriction (fasting) lead to a compensatory rise in ketones to improve energy deficits in the brain derived from cerebral insulin resistance. Two forms of ketone bodies, ß-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, fuel the brain during starvation, fasting and strenuous exercise. Ketones are neuroprotective agents that shelter the aging brain from memory loss and neurodegeneration. Induced ketone production has been shown to ameliorate mitochondrial function, reduce the expression of apoptotic and inflammatory mediators and provide neuroprotection to cells (Lange et al., 2017). This case study highlights an innovative research design aimed at attenuating memory decline in a 57<U+202F>year old female previously diagnosed with comorbid mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Mild cognitive impairment is a predementia syndrome known to precede AD (Michaud et al, 2017). The 12-week intervention included ketogenic nutrition protocol, high intensity interval training (HIIT) and memory training using the PEAK brain training app. Memory function was assessed via the MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) pre/post intervention. Physiological biomarkers for MetS including HOMA-IR(homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance), triglyceride/HDL ratio, HgA1c, fasting triglycerides and HDL were measured pre/post intervention.

"29538217","Correlation between acute stroke-induced white matter lesions and insulin resistance.","The present study was to examine the relationship between white matter lesions (WMLs) and insulin resistance (IR) in patients with acute stroke and evaluate clinical prognosis.Around 200 patients with initial onset of acute stroke including 146 patients (73.0%) with WMLs and 54 patients (27%) without WMLs were analyzed by neuropsychological scales. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin, blood lipid, homocysteine (Hcy), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), creatinine, and uric acid, diabetes mellitus (DM), prediabetes (PD), and normal glucose (NG) were determined according to HbA1c levels. According to homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-IR index of IR, HOMA-IR index =2.5 indicated IR, and HOMA-IR index<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>2.5 represented noninsulin resistance (NON-IR).IR values and the proportion of patients with IR, HbA1c levels and the quantity of DM patients, the levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, Hcy, and hs-CRP of patients with WMLs were significantly higher than those in patients without WMLs (all P<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>.05). OR value of IR exposure and WMLs was 1.862 (1.235-2.236). OR values of level 1, level 2, and level 3 WMLs were 1.632 (1.032-2.532), 1.328 (1.152-2.865), and 1.158 (0.639-3.526), respectively. Regarding WMLs patients, MoCA and MMSE scores were significantly decreased, and Hamilton Depression Scale scores were significantly increased (all P<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>.05). National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin scale scores of patients with WMLs were significantly increased, and BI scores were significantly decreased (all P<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>.05).IR is intimately correlated with the WMLs of acute stroke. The incidence and severity of WMLs are significantly associated with cerebral arterial thrombosis, neuropsychology, and neurological scores."
"29492658","The association of short-term memory and cognitive impairment with ghrelin, leptin, and cortisol levels in non-diabetic and diabetic elderly individuals.","AIMS: This study assessed short-term memory and biochemical indicators with the levels of ghrelin, leptin, and cortisol between cognitive impairment and normal older adults with or without diabetes.METHODS: We enrolled 286 older adults (aged 65-85 years) with or without diabetes from the local community. Short-term memory was assessed using pictures of common objects; cognitive functioning was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The physiological indexes assessed were plasma levels of fasting ghrelin and leptin, ghrelin level at 2_h after breakfast, 24-h urinary cortisol value, body mass index, and plasma cortisol levels at 8:00 a.m., 4:00 p.m., and 12:00 p.m.RESULTS: In both non-diabetic and diabetic subjects, short-term memory was significantly lower in the impaired cognition group (5.99 ± 2.90 in non-diabetic subjects and 4.71 ± 2.14 in diabetic subjects) than in the normal cognition group (8.14 ± 2.23 in non-diabetic subjects and 7.82 ± 3.37 in diabetic subjects). Baseline ghrelin level was significantly lower in the impaired cognition group (9.07 ± 1.13 ng/mL in non-diabetic subjects and 7.76 ± 1.34 ng/mL in diabetic subjects) than in the normal cognition group (10.94 ± 1.53 ng/mL in non-diabetic subjects and 9.93 ± 1.76 ng/mL in diabetic subjects); plasma cortisol levels at 8:00 a.m., 4:00 p.m., and 12:00 p.m. were significantly higher in the impaired cognition group than in the normal cognition group, while no significant difference was observed in plasma levels of fasting leptin between different groups.CONCLUSIONS: Fasting plasma ghrelin and cortisol levels may be markers of cognitive decline and memory loss. It is possible that adjusting their levels may have a therapeutic effect, and this should be investigated in future studies."
"29392877","Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment cut-off score to clarify improvement of mild cognitive impairment after exercise training in community-dwelling older adults.","AIM: Physical exercise improves cognitive function in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, information about whether the degree of MCI before exercise training affects improvement in cognitive function is lacking. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the cut-off value in a MCI screening tool that predicts reversal to normal cognitive function after exercise training in older adults with MCI.METHODS: Participants included 112 Japanese community-dwelling older adult outpatients (37 men, 75 women; mean age 76.3<U+2009>years). We administered the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J) before and after exercise training. MCI was defined as a MoCA-J score &lt;26. All participants underwent exercise training 2<U+2009>days per week for 6<U+2009>months, according to American Heart Association guidelines.RESULTS: The prevalence of MCI was 65.2%. After exercise training, 46.6% of participants with MCI reversed to normal cognitive function. The MoCA-J cut-off score to predict cognitive function potentially reversible to normal was 23, with receiver operating characteristic analysis showing an area under the curve of 0.80, sensitivity of 79.4% and specificity of 69.2%. Multiple logistic regression analysis to predict non-MCI after exercise training showed that MoCA-J score =23 (OR 6.9, P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.001), female sex (OR 3.4, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.04) and age (OR 0.9, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.04) were independent determinants.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA-J cut-off score of 23 might be useful to predict cognitive function that is potentially reversible to normal among community-dwelling Japanese older adults with MCI.

"29362618","Correlation between the Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Indonesian Version (Moca-INA) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in Elderly.","BACKGROUND: As the rapid growth of the elderly population and the increased prevalence of Alezheimer's Disease and related disorders, there is an increasing need for effective cognitive screening. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is the most frequently used screening test of cognitive impairment because of its convenience. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Indonesian Version (MoCA-INA) has been validated and recently been used as a cognitive screening tool.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the MMSE and MoCA-INA scores and to determine the correlation between the MMSE and MoCA-INA scores in elderly.MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study including 83 elderly subjects from November 2016 until June 2017. We performed MMSE and MoCA-INA for assessment of cognitive function and the time between each test was at least 30 minutes.RESULTS: The study included 83 subjects which were consisted of 46 (55.4%) males and 37 (44.6%) females. The mean age was 69.19 ± 4.23 ranging from 65 to 79 years old. The average MMSE scores was 24.96 ± 3.38 (range 14 to 30). The average MoCA-INA scores was 21.06 ± 4.56 (range 5 to 30). The Pearson correlation coefficient between the scores was 0.71 (p&lt;0.005). There were no significant differences of both scores based on history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and previous stroke, but there was a significant difference in MMSE scores based on level of education.CONCLUSION: The MoCA-INA score showed a good correlation with the MMSE score. Both tests showed comparable results but MoCA-INA showed lower average with wider range of scores."

Associations between MoCA-J scores and occlusal force were investigated via bivariate and multivariate analyses.Education level, financial status, depression score, and intake of green and yellow vegetables, as well as number of teeth and occlusal force, were significantly correlated with MoCA-J scores in both age groups. Among individuals aged 80 years, CRP and periodontal status were weakly but significantly associated with MoCA-J score. After controlling for all significant variables via bivariate analyses, the correlation between maximal occlusal force and cognitive function persisted.
