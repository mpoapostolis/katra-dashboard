"17951971","Oxidative DNA damage estimated by plasma 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG): influence of 4, 4'-methylenebis (2-chloroaniline) exposure and smoking.","Oxidative DNA damage may play an important role in the human carcinogenic process. Recently, we reported a case of bladder cancer among 4, 4'-methylenebis (2-chloroaniline) (MBOCA)-exposed workers. By measuring the plasma level of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), we investigated the association between oxidative DNA damage and MBOCA exposure. In addition, we examined the effects of different confounders on the plasma level of 8-OHdG. We undertook a cross-sectional survey at four MBOCA-producing factories in Taiwan (158 subjects). Plasma 8-OHdG levels and urinary MBOCA concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Personal characteristics were collected by questionnaire. The workers were classified according to their job titles as exposed (n=57) or unexposed (n=101) groups as well as classified according to urinary MBOCA levels as high urinary MBOCA (&gt;20 microg/g creatinine) (n=45) or low urinary MBOCA (n=108) groups. Neither the MBOCA-exposed workers nor the high urinary MBOCA workers had a significant increase in the mean plasma 8-OHdG level, even after adjustment for potential confounders. Age and gender were significantly positively correlated with plasma 8-OHdG levels. Smokers among high urinary MBOCA workers also had significantly higher 8-OHdG levels than non-smokers among high urinary MBOCA workers. Our study provides evidence that smoking rather than MBOCA exposure induces elevation of plasma 8-OHdG levels among workers exposed to MBOCA, indicating that oxidative DNA damage does not play an important role in the carcinogenic processes of MBOCA."
"17328916","Mild cognitive impairment in symptomatic and asymptomatic cerebrovascular disease.","We tried to evaluate and to compare usefulness of two brief cognitive tests in early detection of cognitive decline in subjects with increased cerebrovascular (CV) risk. As CV risk factors are recognised as important in etiology of dementia, we also aimed to determine the possible associations of specific CV risk factors and cognitive results. Patients (PGs) with first-ever stroke or TIA (N=110) and CV symptoms-free controls (CGs) with CV risk factors present (N=45) matched for age, gender and education level were tested using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) on admission, at three- and six-month points. In all subjects, detailed CV risk factors profile was assessed. We observed the decrement in cognitive performance during the six-month study period in both groups, more evident if MoCA (p&lt;0.001) than if MMSE was used (p=0.022). Six months after first stroke/TIA 83.6% PGs scored below normal range on MoCA. In PGs, positive associations for cognitive decrement and multiple CV risk factors (&gt;2) were found (p=0.034 for MMSE; p=0.002 for MoCA). In CGs, positive associations were found for cognitive decrement and arterial hypertension with increased IMT values (p&lt;0.001 for MMSE) and for multiple CV risk factors and arterial hypertension (p=0.003 for MoCA). The use of MoCA could aid to early recognition of cognitive deficits in persons with increased CV risk. Individuals with multiple CV risk factors seem to have increased risk of cognitive decline."
"17260164","Anticoagulation treatment for the reduction of stroke in atrial fibrillation: a cohort study to examine the gap between guidelines and routine medical practice.","BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart arrhythmia, affecting 6% of people over 65 years, and carries a 4.5% average annual stroke risk, which can be reduced by appropriate anticoagulation. A multi-centre observational study, Management and Outcomes in the Care of Atrial fibrillation in Germany (MOCA) was conducted to evaluate the current anticoagulation treatment pattern in patients with AF in Germany.METHODS: Patients with AF were recruited from December 2003 to June 2004 in physician practices. Clinical data including International Normalised Ratio (INR) values and anticoagulation strategy were obtained from the physician chart and the patient follow-up, documenting hospitalisations, medications, and complications, was conducted at three and six months. Main outcome measures included anticoagulation methods, practice guidelines adherence and time within recommended anticoagulation range.RESULTS: 361 patients with AF (mean age 71+/-9, 61% male) were recruited in 45 physician practices. 90% of all patients had been treated with Vitamin K-Antagonists (VKA) at some time since AF-diagnosis, 88% were still treated. 10% of patients received aspirin as their anticoagulation therapy. Monitoring occurred at least once a month in over 70% of patients. Monitored INR values were 56% of the time within, 14% below and 30% over the recommended target range. A gap of 40% existed between the guideline recommendations and actual practice. Younger patients (&lt;60 years of age) with no documented risk factors for stroke were over-treated with VKAs and patients older than 75 years without contraindications for anticoagulation were under-treated.CONCLUSIONS: This study presents 'real-life' data in treating patients with AF in Germany and identifies the potential to advance the quality of care with respect to anticoagulation."
"18850670","Cross validation of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in community dwelling older adults residing in the Southeastern US.","OBJECTIVE: Cross validation study of the MoCA for the detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in a community-based cohort residing in the Southeastern United States.METHODS: One hundred and eighteen English-speaking older adults, who underwent diagnostic evaluation as part of an on-going prospective study, were administered the MoCA and MMSE. Twenty were diagnosed with AD, 24 met criteria for amnestic MCI and 74 were considered cognitively normal. Sensitivities and specificities were calculated using the recommended cut-off scores and ROC curve analyses were performed to determine optimal sensitivity and specificity. The influence of age, education and gender on MoCA score was also examined.RESULTS: Using a cut-off score of 24 or below, the MMSE was insensitive to cognitive impairment. Using the recommended cut-off score of 26, the MoCA detected 97% of those with cognitive impairment but specificity was fair (35%). Using a lower cut-off score of 23, the MoCA exhibited excellent sensitivity (96%) and specificity (95%).CONCLUSION: The MoCA appears to have utility as a cognitive screen for early detection of AD and for MCI and warrants further investigation regarding its applicability in primary care settings, varying ethnic groups, and younger at-risk individuals."
"18346324","[The application of Montreal cognitive assessment in urban Chinese residents of Beijing].","OBJECTIVE: To study the distribution of Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scores in terms of age and educational level in Chinese residents aged 50 years and over and to offer a benchmark for a cutoff score.METHODS: A total of 281 residents aged 50 years or older was drawn randomly in the urban areas of Beijing, including 215 healthy elderly controls (NC) and 66 patients meeting the clinical criteria of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The final scores for MoCA were given in the form of mean percentage distributions specific for age, sex and educational level so as to compare the validity of MMSE mini-mental state examination and MoCA in detecting MCI. By a fitting multiple regression model the influence of the factors on MMSE and MoCA was assessed.RESULTS: Using a cutoff score of 26, MMSE had a sensitivity of 24.2% to detect MCI, whereas MoCA detected 92.4% of the MCI subjects. We found a bivariate correlation between MoCA scores and both the factors of age and educational level (P &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: MoCA is a brief cognitive screening tool with high sensitivity and specificity for detecting MCI as currently conceptualized in patients performing normally on MMSE. Our adjustment in the cutoff scores would improve the detection of MCI and Alzheimer's disease by reducing the number of false negatives. MoCA scores should be used to identify current cognitive difficulties but not to make formal diagnoses."
"19937448","Validation studies of the Portuguese experimental version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA): confirmatory factor analysis.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a cognitive screening instrument created with the purpose of overcoming some of the insufficiencies of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The MoCA evaluates more cognitive areas and is comprised of more complex tasks as compared with the MMSE, which makes it a more sensitive instrument in the detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a state that often progresses to dementia. In this study we performed an analysis of the psychometric and diagnostic properties of the Portuguese experimental version of the MoCA in a clinical sample of 212 subjects with MCI and several dementia subtypes in a memory clinic setting. Additionally, we performed a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to assess the MoCA's latent factorial structure. In a clinical population, the MoCA is a valid and reliable instrument with good psychometric properties, revealing high sensitivity in identifying MCI and dementia patients who generally score within the normal range on the MMSE. By using the parcels method, CFA results showed very good/excellent adjustment indexes. The practical implications of this CFA study allow us to propose a two factor model factorial structure for the MoCA: a first factor designated Memory, which includes memory, language and orientation subtests (the latter being closely correlated with the former), and a second factor designated Attention/Executive Functions, comprised of attention, executive functions and visuospacial abilities tasks."
"19831129","Detection of cognitive impairment and dementia using the animal fluency test: the DECIDE study.","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of a one-minute screening test measured against a validated 10-minute screening test for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in detecting CI in patients aged &gt; or = 65 years with two or more vascular risk factors (VRF).METHODS: Patients (n=1523) aged 65 years or older without documented CI symptoms or dementia with two or more VRF participated in this study set in Canadian primary care practice. Baseline data was collected, followed by the 1-minute animal fluency (AF) test and the 10-minute Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Physicians (n=122) completed case reports during patient interviews and reported their diagnostic impression. AF test sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in predicting a positive MoCA was assessed.RESULTS: Study sample mean age was 79.7 years, 55% were female, 97.6% were Caucasian and 75% had &lt; or = 12 years of education. The AF test and MoCA detected CI in 52 and 56 percent of the study population, respectively. The AF test demonstrated sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in predicting a positive MoCA of 67 percent each. Physicians diagnostic impression of MCI was reported for 37% of patients, and of dementia for 6%.CONCLUSION: In an elderly population with at least two VRF, using AF can be useful in detecting previously unknown symptoms of CI or dementia. Screening for CI in this high risk population is warranted to assist physician recognition of early CI. The short AF administration time favours its incorporation into clinical practice."
"19772593","Quantitative gait analysis under dual-task in older people with mild cognitive impairment: a reliability study.","BACKGROUND: Reliability of quantitative gait assessment while dual-tasking (walking while doing a secondary task such as talking) in people with cognitive impairment is unknown. Dual-tasking gait assessment is becoming highly important for mobility research with older adults since better reflects their performance in the basic activities of daily living. Our purpose was to establish the test-retest reliability of assessing quantitative gait variables using an electronic walkway in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) under single and dual-task conditions.METHODS: The gait performance of 11 elderly individuals with MCI was evaluated using an electronic walkway (GAITRite System) in two sessions, one week apart. Six gait parameters (gait velocity, step length, stride length, step time, stride time, and double support time) were assessed under two conditions: single-task (sG: usual walking) and dual-task (dG: counting backwards from 100 while walking). Test-retest reliability was determined using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Gait variability was measured using coefficient of variation (CoV).RESULTS: Eleven participants (average age = 76.6 years, SD = 7.3) were assessed. They were high functioning (Clinical Dementia Rating Score = 0.5) with a mean Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) score of 28 (SD = 1.56), and a mean Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of 22.8 (SD = 1.23). Under dual-task conditions, mean gait velocity (GV) decreased significantly (sGV = 119.11 +/- 20.20 cm/s; dGV = 110.88 +/- 19.76 cm/s; p = 0.005). Additionally, under dual-task conditions, higher gait variability was found on stride time, step time, and double support time. Test-retest reliability was high (ICC&gt;0.85) for the six parameters evaluated under both conditions.CONCLUSION: In older people with MCI, variability of time-related gait parameters increased with dual-tasking suggesting cognitive control of gait performance. Assessment of quantitative gait variables using an electronic walkway is highly reliable under single and dual-task conditions. The presence of cognitive impairment did not preclude performance of dual-tasking in our sample supporting that this methodology can be reliably used in cognitive impaired older individuals."
"19260980","Montreal Cognitive Assessment Arabic version: reliability and validity prevalence of mild cognitive impairment among elderly attending geriatric clubs in Cairo.","AIM: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical label which includes elderly subjects with memory impairment and with no significant daily functional disability. MCI is an important target for Alzheimer's dementia prevention studies. Data on the prevalence and incidence of MCI varies greatly according to cultural difference. The first aim of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Arabic version in MCI detection. The second was to determine the prevalence of MCI among apparently healthy elderly people attending geriatric clubs in Cairo.METHODS: In stage I reliability &amp; validity of MoCA Arabic version were assessed in reference to Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG). In stage II prevalence of MCI was estimated using Arabic MoCA among apparently healthy elderly attending geriatric clubs. These geriatric clubs were randomly selected from different regions in Cairo governorate.RESULTS: Test-retest reliability data of the Arabic MoCA were collected approximately 35.0 +/- 17.6 days apart. The mean change in Arabic MoCA scores from the first to second evaluation was 0.9 +/- 2.5 points, and correlation between the two evaluations was high (correlation coefficient = 0.92, P &lt; 0.001). The internal consistency of the Arabic MoCA was good, yielding a Cronbach's alpha on the standardized items of 0.83. In diagnosing mild cognitive impairment, the Arabic MoCA showed 92.3% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity. The prevalence of MCI among elderly subjects attending geriatric clubs in Cairo is 34.2% and 44.3% of healthy men and women, respectively.CONCLUSION: Older age, female sex and less education are the independent risk factors for MCI among apparently healthy elderly subjects attending geriatric clubs in Cairo."
"19170786","Montreal cognitive assessment performance in patients with Parkinson's disease with &quot;normal&quot; global cognition according to mini-mental state examination score.","OBJECTIVES: To examine Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) performance in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with &quot;normal&quot; global cognition according to Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score.DESIGN: A cross-sectional comparison of the MoCA and the MMSE.SETTING: Two movement disorders centers at the University of Pennsylvania and the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center.PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of 131 patients with idiopathic PD who were screened for cognitive and psychiatric complications.MEASUREMENTS: Subjects were administered the MoCA and MMSE, and only subjects defined as having a normal age- and education-adjusted MMSE score were included in the analyses (N=100). As previously recommended in patients without PD, a MoCA score less than 26 was used to indicate the presence of at least mild cognitive impairment (MCI).RESULTS: Mean MMSE and MoCA scores+/-standard deviation were 28.8+/-1.1 and 24.9+/-3.1, respectively. More than half (52.0%) of subjects with normal MMSE scores had cognitive impairment according to their MoCA score. Impairments were seen in numerous cognitive domains, including memory, visuospatial and executive abilities, attention, and language. Predictors of cognitive impairment on the MoCA using univariate analyses were male sex, older age, lower educational level, and greater disease severity; older age was the only predictor in a multivariate model.CONCLUSION: Approximately half of patients with PD with a normal MMSE score have cognitive impairment based on the recommended MoCA cutoff score. These results suggest that MCI is common in PD and that the MoCA is a more sensitive instrument than the MMSE for its detection."
"21163106","[Burden and related factors among care-takers of patients with Parkinson's disease].","OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact on caretaker who looked after patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and to identify the main factors related to their burden.METHODS: 115 consecutive pairs of PD patients and their caretakers were included. Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI) was used to assess the burden of PD on the caretakers. Patients were evaluated by neurologists using the United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Hoehn and Yahr Scale (H-Y Scale), the Activity of Daily Living Scale (ADL), the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE). Multiple linear stepwise regression models were fitted to ascertain the factors linked to the CBI.RESULTS: Based on multiple linear stepwise regression analysis, ADL (ß = -0.813, t = -6.265, P = 0.000) and PDQ-39 (ß = 0.285, t = 4.256, P = 0.000) of patients and the age of caretakers (ß = 0.327, t = 3.107, P = 0.002) proved to be the main predictors of CBI.CONCLUSION: Many factors might comprehensively affect the burden of PD on caretakers of the patients. Attention needs to be given to the early identification of factors that generating stress on caretakers in order to improve their quality of life."
"21156989","Validity of the montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) as a screening test for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in a cardiovascular population.","While rates of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are relatively high in populations with cardiovascular diseases and risk factors, screening tests for MCI have not been evaluated in this patient group. This study investigated the sensitivity and specificity of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) tool for detecting MCI in 110 patients (mean age 67.9 + 11.7 years; 60% female) recruited from hospital cardiovascular outpatient clinics. Mean MoCA performance was relatively low (22.8 + 3.8) in this group, with 72.1% of participants scoring below the recommended cutoff for cognitive impairment (&lt;26). The presence of MCI was determined using the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery Screening Module (NAB-SM). Both amnestic MCI and multiple-domain MCI were identified. The optimum MoCA cutoff for detecting MCI in this group was &lt;24. At this cutoff, the MoCA's sensitivity for detecting amnestic MCI was 100% and for multiple-domain MCI it was 83.3%. Specificity rates for amnestic MCI and multiple-domain MCI were 50.0% and 52% respectively. The poor specificity of the MoCA suggests that it will have limited value as a screening test for MCI in settings where the overall prevalence of MCI is low."
"21154110","Psychometric evaluation of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in three diverse samples.","Our objective was to evaluate the utility of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in both non-clinical and clinical populations. The MoCA, a tool used widely in clinical geriatric practice to detect and quantify cognitive impairment, was administered to three diverse samples to assess the psychometric properties of the instrument. Participants were 482 healthy persons seen in the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study (CCLS), 1923 healthy volunteers evaluated by the Dallas Heart Study (DHS), a population-based sample of Dallas County residents and 69 persons with known or suspected brain pathology, seen for clinical evaluation. The standard deviations in the CCLS and DHS groups were small (2.81, 3.87) and moderate in the clinical group (5.22). The corresponding raw coefficients alpha were. 50,. 63, and. 75. Thus, variability and internal consistency were associated. MoCA scores generally did not correlate with gender and correlated with age only in the clinical group. However, there were moderately strong positive correlations between MoCA scores and education in all three samples. The reliability of the MoCA was extremely low in the two non-clinical groups, but was high in the clinical group. Although useful in large non-clinical studies, the MoCA is best suited to detect and quantify cognitive impairment in clinical patients."
"21070702","Screening cognitive performance with the Resident Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Cognitive Performance Scale.","OBJECTIVE: The validity of the Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS) embedded in the Resident Assessment Instrument-Mental Health (RAI-MH) was evaluated among adult psychiatric inpatients.METHODS: The CPS is a brief measure of cognitive performance, with scores ranging from 0 (intact) to 6 (very severe impairment). The CPS scores were compared with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores for 215 adult psychiatric inpatients.RESULTS: The CPS scores were significantly correlated with MMSE scores (r = -0.69, P &lt; 0.001) and MoCA scores (r = -0.69, P &lt; 0.001). Higher scores on the CPS were associated with greater functional impairment, older age, and a greater prevalence of dementia diagnoses than lower CPS scores.CONCLUSIONS: Pilot data show the CPS is a valid screening measure of cognitive performance among adult psychiatric inpatients. Additional research is needed to replicate our study using a larger sample with more diverse mental health conditions."
"20957394","Prospective comparison of the prognostic utility of the Mini Mental State Examination and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in patients with brain metastases.","PURPOSE: The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is the most commonly chosen cognitive screening test (CST) in clinical practice and trials, despite its poor sensitivity, likely because of its prognostic utility. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is an alternative CST, is more sensitive, and is better correlated with quality of life.METHODS: Sixty-five patients with brain metastases were prospectively accrued and completed both the MMSE and MoCA. We compared the prognostic utility of both CSTs.RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 59.0 years; 42.0% had single brain metastases. Median MMSE and MoCA scores were 28 and 22, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) was worse for individuals with below- versus above-average MMSE scores (10.4 versus 36.3 weeks, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.007). Likewise, below- versus above-average MoCA scores were prognostic (6.3 versus 50.0 weeks, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). Median OS for MoCA scores &lt;22, 22-26, and &gt;26 were 6.3, 30.9, and 61.7 weeks, respectively (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). On multivariable analysis, below-average MMSE scores were no longer prognostic (hazard ratio [HR]<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.71 [0.90-3.26]), though below-average MoCA scores were (HR<U+2009>=<U+2009>5.44 [2.70-10.94]). Furthermore, the MoCA demonstrated superior prognostic utility when comparing multivariable models with continuous CST scores.CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the MoCA is a superior prognostic indicator than the MMSE. Furthermore, given its superior sensitivity and better correlation with quality of life, the MoCA should be preferentially chosen in clinical practice and trials."
"20884013","Breath holding index in detection of early cognitive decline.","The aim of the study was to evaluate role of breath holding index (BHI) as a functional parameter for intracranial subclinical atherosclerotic changes in recognizing patients who are at risk for developing cognitive impairment of the vascular type. We included 60 volunteers divided into 3 groups according to age and presence of cognitive impairment (healthy subjects 30-40 years old, controls 60-70 years old and subjects with mild cognitive impairment 60-70 years old). We excluded individuals with moderate and severe carotid stenosis. There was a decreasing trend in the mean blood flow velocities of the intracranial blood vessels due to age increase, but it was not statistically significant. BHI values were 1.66±0.20 in the first group, 1.35±0.31 in the second and 0.69±0.30 in the third group. There was a statistically significant difference between the first two groups and the group with a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) score (29±1, 27±1 and 19±1 respectively), no statistically significant difference was found in Mini mental state exam (MMSE) score (29±1, 28±1, and 28±1 respectively). After regressing out age and conventional vascular risk factors, we found a good correlation between the decreasing trend in BHI values and MoCA score, and no statistically significant correlation between the BHI values and MMSE score. Results of our study show that BHI test as a parameter of impaired cerebrovascular reactivity (intracranial small vessel wall dysfunction) might differentiate individuals with early cognitive decline from healthy subjects."
"20714236","Cognitive impairment predicts functional capacity in dementia-free patients with cardiovascular disease.","BACKGROUND AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVE: A high proportion of elderly people with cardiovascular diseases and risk factors have mild forms of cognitive impairment, the functional impact of which is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine whether subtle cognitive impairment contributes to limitations in instrumental activities of daily living in this group and whether this association is independent of physical comorbidity and other potentially confounding factors.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and nineteen nondemented patients were recruited from cardiovascular and diabetic hospital outpatient clinics. Functional dependence was assessed using the self-report version of the instrumental activities of daily living scale. Cognitive ability was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Demographic and clinical information was collected via interview and a review of hospital records. Standard logistic regression was performed to identify factors independently associated with functional status.RESULTS: Five variables (sex, cardiovascular disease burden, non-cardiovascular disease burden, cognitive status, and age) were independently associated with an increased likelihood of requiring assistance with 1 or more everyday activities. The likelihood of needing assistance increased 2.05 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.59-2.79) for each additional cardiovascular diagnosis present and 1.12 times (95% CI, 1.01-1.27) for every point lower on MoCA. Thus, in comparison to a person with a perfect MoCA score, a person who scored in the cognitively impaired range (&lt;23) was 7.7 (CI, 7.07-8.89) times more likely to report that he/she required assistance with an everyday activity.CONCLUSION: Cognitive impairments appear to reduce the ability to independently carry out routine daily tasks in patients with cardiovascular diseases and risk factors. Cognition should therefore be considered along with physical symptoms when assessing and responding to the support needs of this group."
"20689285","Cognitive deterioration rates in patients with Parkinson's disease from northeastern China.","AIMS: Cognitive impairment (CI) is common in Parkinson's disease (PD), and the cognitive deterioration rate (CDR) is heterogeneous among PD patients. However, very few studies have reported on the association of PD features and risk factors with rapid CDR. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is considered to be a sensitive and reliable approach to detect mild CI. In the present study, we sought to define and compare the cognitive profiles and clinical features of PD patients with slow or rapid CDRs, and then to identify the PD risk factors associated with rapid CDR.METHODS: A cross-sectional study of cognitive rate was performed using the MoCA in a cohort of 73 PD patients and 41 controls matched for age, sex and education level.RESULTS: The rapid CDR group was characterized by older age (58.8 years in slow CDR vs. 64.1 in rapid CDR; p = 0.02), later age at disease onset (52.7 vs. 61.7 years; p &lt; 0.001), a faster deterioration rate of movement symptoms (UPDRS III increment of 12.8 vs. 5.9/year; p &lt; 0.001), a higher rate in multiple-domain CI (38.9 vs. 10.8%), and generally lower MoCA subscores for the Clock Drawing Test, attention, verbal fluency and abstraction. According to the univariate logistic regression model, onset age, movement deterioration rate, multiple domains CI and executive function CI were risk factors for rapid CDR. However, only the movement deterioration rate (p = 0.01) and onset age (p = 0.05) remained independent predictors for rapid CDR according to the multivariate logistic regression model.CONCLUSIONS: The CI deterioration in a subset of PD patients appears to progress more rapidly. Identifying those PD patients may not only help to predict the development of PD dementia, but also facilitate therapeutic intervention at early disease stages."
"20615057","Utility of the NeuroTrax computerized battery for cognitive screening in Parkinson's disease: comparison with the MMSE and the MoCA.","To determine the utility of a computerized assessment in Parkinson's disease (PD), we compared the cognitive performance of 50 PD patients on the NeuroTrax computerized battery relative to the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The results revealed fair agreement between impairment on the NeuroTrax and the MMSE (kappa=.291, p=.031) but only slight agreement between the NeuroTrax and the MoCA (kappa=.138, p = .054) and between the MoCA and the MMSE (kappa = .168, p = .069). The NeuroTrax identified 52% of the sample as average or above, 40% as below average, and 8% as impaired. The MoCA identified 54% of the sample as impaired (28% average or above and 18% below average), while the MMSE identified 66% as average or above (20% below average and 14% impaired). Several stepwise regressions revealed that executive and verbal functions were the best predictors of cognitive functioning on the NeuroTrax, while memory recall, serial sevens, naming, and abstraction were the best predictors on the MoCA. These results suggest that although the NeuroTrax may be useful in identifying executive cognitive deficits in PD, similar to the MMSE the NeuroTrax may lack optimal sensitivity. While the MoCA is sensitive, it may be too stringent in overclassifying PD patients as impaired."

Furthermore, Fuld object memory test (FOM) was used to assess delayed memory while rapid verbal retrieve (RVR) was used to assess language fluency. Digit span subtest was used to assess attention and building blocks was used to assess visual space function respectively.RESULTS: 100 PD patients were recruited, including 52 men and 48 women, from 43 to 86 years old (65.6 +/- 17.1). MMSE scores was used as the standard for Recognition, PD with cognitive impairment accounted for 16%. According to MOCA scores, with PD cognitive disturbances accounted for 83%. Ability for calculation, short-term memory, visual space function, abstract capability, attention and language fluency dysfunction were main cognitive disturbances of PD. Analysis from single factor logistic regression showed that education, age of onset and gender were closely related to the occurrence of cognitive impairment on PD patients.CONCLUSION: Cognitive impairment was common in PD. Ability of calculation, short-term memory, visual space function, abstract capability, attention and language fluency dysfunction were main cognitive disturbances of PD. Cognitive impairment of PD was more likely to occur with low degree of education, late onset of PD, and being female."
"20437940","Selection bias introduced by neuropsychological assessments.","OBJECTIVE: Two prospective studies in patient with brain tumours were performed comparing the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The first assessed their feasibility and the second compared their diagnostic accuracy against a four-hour neuropsychological assessment (NPA). The introduction of the NPA decreased accrual and retention rates. We were therefore concerned regarding potential selection bias.METHODS: Ninety-two patients were prospectively accrued and subsequently divided into three categories: a) no NPA required b) withdrew consent to NPA c) completed NPA. In order to quantify any potential bias introduced by the NPA, patient demographics and cognitive test scores were compared between the three groups.RESULTS: There were significant differences in age (p &lt; 0.001), education (p = 0.034), dexamethasone use (p = 0.002), MMSE (p = 0.005), and MoCA scores (p &lt; 0.001) across the different study groups. Furthermore, with increasing involvement of the NPA, patients' cognitive scores and educational status increased, while their age, dexamethasone use, and opioid use all decreased. Individuals who completed the NPA had higher MoCA scores than individuals who were not asked to complete the NPA (24.7 vs. 20.5; p &lt; 0.001). In addition, this relationship held when restricting the analyses to individuals with brain metastases (p &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the lengthy NPA chosen introduced a statistically and clinically significant source of selection bias. These results highlight the importance of selecting brief and well tolerated assessments when possible. However, researchers are challenged by weighing the improved selection bias associated with brief assessments at the cost of reduced diagnostic accuracy."
"20055242","Assessment of subtle cognitive impairment in stroke-free patients with carotid disease.","Carotid disease is a known risk factor for stroke and stroke is a known risk factor for cognitive impairment, but relation between carotid artery stenosis and cognitive function in asymptomatic individuals is less clear. Most patients have only minor complaints of cognitive dysfunction and assessment with usual tests is not sensitive enough. The study included 26 stroke-free patients (15 male and 11 female), mean age 66.3 +/- 8.7 years, with advanced internal carotid artery stenosis or/and occlusion (ICAs/o). Left ICAs/o was present in 11, right ICAs/o in eight, and bilateral ICAs/o in seven patients. History was taken and assessment of risk factors, brain CT scan and neurologic examination were performed. Cognitive functions were tested by use of Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). All patients were asymptomatic, except for two patients that presented with repeated transient ischemic attack (TIA). In all subjects median MMSE scores were within the normal range (27.5; IQ range 25-29), while mean MoCA scores were abnormal (22.6 +/- 3.4). Patients with left ICAs/o scored slightly better on MoCA (22.9 +/- 3.3) than patients with right ICAs/o (22.4 +/- 4.0). Delayed recall MoCA subtest was impaired in 22/26 patients and visuospatial subtest in 23/26 patients; however, there was no statistically significant difference according to the side of ICAs/o. Patients with the presence of one or two risk factors scored lower on visuospatial/executive MoCA subtests (P = 0.018) as compared with patients with multiple risk factors. MoCA proved to be a sensitive tool for assessment of mild cognitive changes in stroke-free patients with advanced ICAs/o. Decline was most pronounced in visuospatial, executive and short-memory functions."
"22193539","Analysis of cognitive dysfunction with silent cerebral infarction: a prospective study in Chinese patients.","To investigate the relationship between Silent Cerebral Infarction (SCI) and cognitive impairment to testify that Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a more sensitive screening tool than the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) to identify cognitive deficits in patients with SCI. We recruited 196 individuals in Shanghai of China and divided them into 2 groups: the SCI group including 112 individuals (45 men and 67 women; aged from 43 to 70 years old) and the control group including 84 individuals (43 men and 41 women; aged from 42 to 79 years old). We collected information including participants' gender, age, blood glucose, kidney function, blood lipids, blood pressure, Electrocardiogram (ECG), carotid artery ultrasound, MMSE score, and MoCA score. SAS software (version 9.1) was used to perform statistical analysis on physical examinations outcomes from 196 participants. Furthermore, multiple logistic regression model was built up to screen out the independent risk factors of SCI. Besides, Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis was also used. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that abnormal ECG and existence of carotid artery plaques were independent risk factors of SCI occurrence, while MoCA scores was negatively associated with SCI risk. Moreover, MoCA might be more valuable in predicting vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) than MMSE (0.667 vs 0.626). We found that the MMSE was generally insensitive to detect cognitive impairment; but the MoCA has a good balance of sensitivity and specificity at the cut-score of 26. We found that the patients with SCI might accompany with VCI and the MoCA appeared to be an excellent screening test for patients with SCI, worthy of being promoted in the clinical practitioning on Chinese population."
"22193353","Montreal cognitive assessment: validation study for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was recently proposed as a cognitive screening test for milder forms of cognitive impairment, having surpassed the well-known limitations of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). This study aims to validate the MoCA for screening Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD) through an analysis of diagnostic accuracy and the proposal of cut-offs. Patients were classified into 2 clinical groups according to standard criteria: MCI (n=90) and AD (n=90). The 2 control groups (C-MCI: n=90; C-AD: n=90) consisted of cognitively healthy community dwellers selected to match patients in sex, age, and education. The MoCA showed consistently superior psychometric properties compared with the MMSE, and higher diagnostic accuracy to discriminate between MCI (area under the curve=0.856; 95% confidence interval, 0.796-0.904) and AD patients (area under the curve=0.980; 95% confidence interval, 0.947-0.995). At an optimal cut-off of below 22 for MCI and below 17 for AD, the MoCA achieved significantly superior values in comparison with MMSE for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and classification accuracy. Furthermore, the MoCA revealed higher sensitivity to cognitive decline in longitudinal monitoring. This study provides robust evidence that the MoCA is a better cognitive tool than the widely used MMSE for the screening and monitoring of MCI and AD in clinical settings."
"22176962","[The evolution of cognition and its influence factors after stroke].","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the evolution of cognitive function and its influence factors, so as to provide evidence for guiding treatment of cognitive impairment after stroke.METHODS: A total of 98 cases of patients with stroke admitted in the First and Second Affiliated Hospital of Medical College of Xi'an Jiaotong University and Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital between April and September 2009 were enrolled and recruited. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive function rating scale (MoCA) were adopted to assess the evolution of cognition at acute phase (within 2 weeks), 6 weeks, and 12 weeks after stroke among patients within 2 weeks after onset, questionnaire score = 56, without aphasia and consciousness disturbance and at least one side of upper extremities muscle force = grade 3.RESULTS: When using MMSE scale as criteria, the incidence of cognitive impairment was 24.5% at acute phase, 12.1% at 6 weeks and 9.9% at 12 weeks after stroke, while the incidence was 86.8%, 68.2%, and 38.0% respectively when using MoCA scale as criteria. The scales of MMSE and MoCA were increased and the incidence of cognitive impairment was decreased within 12 weeks after stroke. Logistic regression analysis indicated that, advanced age (ß = -0.124), hypertension (ß = -3.705), low education level(ß = 0.560) and depression after stroke (ß = 4.613) were related with cognitive impairment after stroke (all P values &lt; 0.05); low education level(ß = 0.710), coronary heart disease (ß = -3.649), elevated total cholesterol (TC) (ß = -3.361) and low density lipid cholesterol (LDL-C) (ß = -5.833), and depression (ß = -3.612) delayed recovery of cognition after stroke.CONCLUSIONS: The cognitive function improves and the incidence of cognitive impairment lowers as the time goes on within 12 weeks after stroke. The factors that may affect the improvement of cognitive function include low educational level, coronary heart disease, elevated TC and LDL-C, and post-stroke depression."
"22163236","Proactive approach in detecting elderly subjects with cognitive decline in general practitioners' practices.","BACKGROUND: Although cognitive decline is a common finding among the elderly and is considered a risk factor for developing dementia, it is rarely diagnosed by general practitioners (GPs).AIM: To evaluate cognitive function with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in asymptomatic subjects in daily GP practice and compare subjects who confirmed having cognitive problems with subjects who did not.METHODS: 388 consecutive subjects &gt;65 years of age who consulted their GP were interviewed and tested with MMSE and MoCA.RESULTS: None of the study subjects spontaneously complained of cognitive or memory problems. 155 subjects (39.94%) confirmed having cognitive problems and 233 (60.05%) did not even when asked. The prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was 18.30% (95% CI 14.36-22.04) and the prevalence of cognitive impairment/no dementia (CIND) was 17.27% (95% CI 13.50-21.04). Delayed memory recall as a separate cognitive domain in MoCA was significantly worse in subjects with MCI (p = 0.00958) and in those with CIND (p = 0.0208).CONCLUSION: There is a significant number of patients in daily GP practices with unrecognized, but objectively verifiable, cognitive deficits who do not report having cognitive problems. They can be identified by assessment with MMSE and MoCA already in the GP practice."
"22156700","MoCA, ACE-R, and MMSE versus the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network Vascular Cognitive Impairment Harmonization Standards Neuropsychological Battery after TIA and stroke.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R) are proposed as short cognitive tests for use after stroke, but there are few published validations against a neuropsychological battery. We studied the relationship between MoCA, ACE-R, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in patients with cerebrovascular disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).METHODS: One hundred consecutive non-institutionalized patients had the MMSE, MoCA, ACE-R, and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network Vascular Cognitive Impairment Harmonization Standards Neuropsychological Battery = 1 year after transient ischemic attack or stroke in a population-based study. MCI was diagnosed using modified Petersen criteria in which subjective cognitive complaint is not required (equivalent to cognitive impairment-no dementia) and subtyped by number and type of cognitive domains affected.RESULTS: Among 91 nondemented subjects completing neuropsychological testing (mean/SD age, 73.4/11.6 years; 44% female; 56% stroke), 39 (42%) had MCI (amnestic multiple domain=10, nonamnestic multiple domain=9, nonamnestic single domain=19, amnestic single domain=1). Sensitivity and specificity for MCI were optimal with MoCA &lt;25 (sensitivity=77%, specificity=83%) and ACE-R &lt;94 (sensitivity=83%, specificity=73%). Both tests detected amnestic MCI better than nonamnestic single-domain impairment. MMSE only achieved sensitivity &gt;70% at a cutoff of &lt;29, mainly due to relative insensitivity to single-domain impairment.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA and ACE-R had good sensitivity and specificity for MCI defined using the Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network Vascular Cognitive Impairment Battery =1 year after transient ischemic attack and stroke, whereas the MMSE showed a ceiling effect. However, optimal cutoffs will depend on use for screening (high sensitivity) or diagnosis (high specificity). Lack of timed measures of processing speed may explain the relative insensitivity of the MoCA and ACE-R to single nonmemory domain impairment."
"22152127","Psychometrics of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and its subscales: validation of the Taiwanese version of the MoCA and an item response theory analysis.","BACKGROUND: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is an instrument for screening mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study examined the psychometric properties and the validity of the Taiwan version of the MoCA (MoCA-T) in an elderly outpatient population.METHODS: Participants completed the MoCA-T, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Chinese Version Verbal Learning Test. The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) was made based on the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, and MCI was diagnosed through the criteria proposed by Petersen et al. (2001).RESULTS: Data were collected from 207 participants (115 males/92 females, mean age: 77.3 ± 7.5 years). Ninety-eight participants were diagnosed with AD, 71 with MCI, and 38 were normal controls. The area under the receiver operator curves (AUC) for predicting AD was 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.97-1.00) for the MMSE, and 0.99 (95% CI = 0.98-1.00) for the MoCA-T. The AUC for predicting MCI was 0.81 (95% CI = 0.72-0.89) using the MMSE and 0.91 (95% CI = 0.86-1.00) using the MoCA-T. Using an optimal cut-off score of 23/24, the MoCA-T had a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 78% for MCI. Item response theory analysis indicated that the level of information provided by each subtest of the MoCA-T was consistent. The frontal and language subscales provided higher discriminating power than the other subscales in the detection of MCI.CONCLUSION: Compared to the MMSE, the MoCA-T provides better psychometric properties in the detection of MCI. The utility of the MoCA-T is optimal in mild to moderate cognitive dysfunction."

"22056842","Cognitive dysfunction in Tunisian LRRK2 associated Parkinson's disease.","BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment and dementia are frequent and debilitating features associated with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). However the prevalence and the pattern of these complications are lacking for LRRK2 (leucine-rich kinase 2)-associated PD patients.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess cognitive function in LRRK2- associated PD patients.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 55 patients diagnosed with PD-related LRRK2 G2019S mutation were included in the study and compared to the same number of G2019S non-carriers PD patients. Age, sex, disease duration, the movement disorder society-unified Parkinson's Disease rating scale (MDS-UPDRS), Hoehn and Yahr stage, Schwab and England scale and the 30-item geriatric depression scale (GDS) scores were noted. Cognitive assessment included MMSE (Mini-Mental Examination), MOCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and FAB (Frontal Assessment Battery).RESULTS: MMSE, MOCA and FAB performance in G2019S carriers PD patients was similar to that of non-carriers. In both groups, performance was primarily impaired on visuospatial and executive tasks. Cognitive impairment was associated with older age, lower educational level and increased severity of motor impairment.CONCLUSION: Cognitive functions were similarly affected in PD patients with and without LRRK2 G2019S mutation with mainly impaired visuospatial and executive abilities. However, these results need to be confirmed by further large and prospective studies."
"21945986","Cognitive performance in asymptomatic patients with advanced carotid disease.","OBJECTIVE: : In the absence of stroke or transient ischemic attack, patients with advanced carotid stenosis or occlusion (ICAs/o) are considered asymptomatic, yet they are prone to mostly subtle cognitive impairment.BACKGROUND: : The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) often fails to detect mild cognitive impairment. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is more sensitive in recognizing such changes.METHODS: : Scores on the MoCA and MMSE were compared in 70 asymptomatic patients with ICAs/o and 70 controls matched for demographic variables and vascular risk factors.RESULTS: : MMSE scores fell mostly within the normal range in both patients and controls. Differences were significant for total MoCA scores (P&lt;0.001). Patients with ICAs/o performed worse on visuospatial and executive function (P=0.018), abstraction (P&lt;0.001), and delayed recall (P&lt;0.001). Lower MoCA scores were associated with diabetes (odds ratio=6.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.277-32.220; P=0.024) and older age (odds ratio=0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.780-0.956; P=0.004). Patients with diabetes performed worse on delayed recall (P&lt;0.001), and patients with hypertension were worse on the MoCA naming subtest (P=0.04).CONCLUSIONS: : The MoCA successfully identified reduced cognitive status in patients with ICAs/o. The MoCA subtest scores revealed a pattern of cognitive impairment similar to that documented in other studies using more extensive neuropsychological tests. MoCA could be used as part of the clinical evaluation of patients with ICAs/o."
"21943640","Carotid endarterectomy protects elderly patients from cognitive decline: a prospective study.","BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) reduces the risk of stroke in selected patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid disease, but its beneficial influence on cognitive performance in the elderly remains debatable. This prospective study sought to determine early and long-term neurocognitive outcomes after CEA for severe unilateral carotid artery stenosis.METHODS: From July 2006 to December 2008, 75 symptomatic (group A) and 70 asymptomatic patients (group B) aged 65 years and older underwent CEA under general anesthesia. Sixty-eight age- and sex-matched individuals who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the same period at our institution served as a control group (group H). Patients with contralateral severe carotid stenosis or occlusion and those with dementia, depression, or a history of major stroke were excluded. Cognitive function was assessed using 2 neuropsychological tests (the Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]) performed preoperatively (T0) and then 3 (T1) and 12 months (T2) after operation. A change of at least 2 points between the scores at T0 and T2 was arbitrarily considered as clinically significant.RESULTS: At T0, group A revealed significant cognitive impairments in both mean test scores by comparison with group H (P = .005 and P &lt; .01, respectively), whereas there were no significant differences between groups A and B, or between groups B and H. Postoperatively, symptomatic patients had significant improvements in their mean cognitive performance scores in both tests (P &lt; .01 and P &lt; .01, respectively), whereas there were no changes in the asymptomatic and control patients' scores. No significant differences emerged for the MMSE scores in the 3 groups, whereas there was a marginally significant difference in the MoCA scores between groups A and H (P = .08), but not for A versus B or B versus H when clinically significant scores were considered.CONCLUSION: Our study showed that only elderly symptomatic patients with severe carotid lesions had a significant improvement in cognitive performance scores after CEA, although the benefit was considered clinically not significant. This suggests that CEA does not diminish neurocognitive functions, but it might provide some protection against cognitive decline in the elderly."

Normative data were generated by age and education. Pearson correlations and analysis of variance were used to examine relationship to demographic variables. Frequency of missed items was also reviewed.RESULTS: Total scores were lower than previously published normative data (mean 23.4, SD 4.0), with 66% falling below the suggested cutoff (&lt;26) for impairment. Most frequently missed items included the cube drawing (59%), delayed free recall (56%; &lt;4/5 words), sentence repetition (55%), placement of clock hands (43%), abstraction items (40%), and verbal fluency (38%; &lt;11 words in 1 minute). Normative data stratified by age and education were derived.CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the need for population-based norms for the MoCA and use of caution when applying established cut scores, particularly given the high failure rate on certain items. Demographic factors must be considered when interpreting this measure."
"21903955","Transient cognitive impairment in TIA and minor stroke.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acute cognitive impairment and delirium occur after major stroke and are associated with poor cognitive outcome. We conducted a population-based study to determine whether transient cognitive impairment (TCI) is seen acutely after cerebral transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke, and whether it predicts long-term cognitive decline.METHODS: Mini-mental-state examination was performed in consecutive testable patients with TIA or minor stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale =3) seen acutely (1-7 days) in the Oxford Vascular Study (2002-2005) versus after 7 days, and in referrals seen acutely who had a subsequent noncerebrovascular diagnosis. We defined TCI as a baseline Mini-mental-state examination score =2 points below the 1-month follow-up score, and identified cognitive impairment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] &lt;26/30) and severe dementia at 1-, 2-, and 5-year follow-up.RESULTS: In 280 TIA and minor stroke patients (mean age/SD 73.5/11.8 years), TCI was more frequent in those seen at 1 to 7 days (80/206; 38.9%) versus later (14/74; 19%; P=0.002) or in noncerebrovascular patients (10/47; 21%; P=0.004). TCI was associated with acute confusion (OR, 5.5; 95% CI, 2.5-11.7; P&lt;0.0001), acute infarct on computed tomography (OR, 2.0; 1.2-3.5; P=0.01), and with residual focal deficits (OR,1.94; 1.13-3.34; P=0.01). However, it was still seen acutely in those whose focal deficits had resolved by time of assessment (41/120; 34%). Although patients with TCI had similar Mini-mental-state examination score by 1 month compared with those without TCI, their 5-year risks of cognitive impairment (OR, 4.3; 1.2-15.7; P=0.03) and severe dementia (OR, 4.9; 1.0-25.8; P=0.05) were increased.CONCLUSIONS: TCI is a manifestation of TIA and minor stroke, and may persist beyond resolution of focal symptoms. Our findings have implications for definitions in TIA and minor stroke and suggest that cognitive fragility may be revealed by minor cerebrovascular events."
"21807379","Frontal subcortical ischemia is crucial for post stroke cognitive impairment.","BACKGROUND: The incidence of post stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) and predictive factors for PSCI among patients with acute lacunar infarcts is unclear.OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of acute lacunar infarcts and chronic white matter disease in the development of PSCI.METHODS: Prospective cohort study of stroke patients attending a tertiary neurology center. Patients with MRI confirmed acute lacunar infarcts without pre-existing dementia were recruited. Logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for developing PSCI.RESULTS: 145 patients with a mean age of 55.8 years were studied of which 48 patients (33.1%) were identified to have PSCI. Patients with PSCI performed worse on the MMSE, MOCA and FAB and had significantly greater white matter hyperintensity (WMH) in the frontal subcortical (FSC) region (p = 0.006) and higher frontal subcortical acute infarct load (p = 0.002). Logistic regression demonstrated that deep subcortical WMH (odds ratio, OR = 1.45) and acute FSC infarcts (OR = 1.51) were associated with PSCI. High WMH load without acute FSC infarcts was associated with increased risk of PSCI (OR = 4.1). When patients developed acute FSC infarcts on pre-existing severe WMH, the risk of PSCI increased substantially (OR = 11.0).CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acute lacunar infarcts in the FSC region have 1.5 times risk of PSCI. This risk increases substantially to 11 times when there is pre-existing severe white matter disease."

Heating of the vein and tumescent anesthesia are not required; only local anesthesia is utilized at the insertion site. In a pilot study, 30 limbs in 25 patients (18 women; mean age 52 years) with GSV incompetence were treated with MOCA using polidocanol at 2 centers. Initial technical success, complications, patient satisfaction, and classification by venous clinical severity score (VCSS) were assessed 6 weeks after the treatment.RESULTS: Initial technical success of MOCA was 100%. There were no major adverse events. Minor complications consisted of 9 local ecchymoses at the puncture site and superficial phlebitis that resolved within a week in 4 limbs. Duplex ultrasonography at 6 weeks showed 26 (87%) of 30 veins were completely occluded; 3 veins showed partial recanalization in the proximal (n = 2) and distal GSV. One patient had full segment recanalization and was successfully retreated. The VCSS significantly improved at 6 weeks (p &lt; 0.001). Patient satisfaction was high, with a median satisfaction of 8.8 on a 0-10 scale.CONCLUSION: This study showed that endovenous MOCA, using polidocanol, is feasible and safe in the treatment of GSV incompetence. Larger studies with a prolonged follow-up are indicated to prove the efficacy of this technique in terms of obliteration rates."
"21530727","The Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment in persons with mild subacute stroke: relationship to functional outcome.","OBJECTIVES: To compare Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) global and subscores in classifying cognitive impairment in persons with mild stroke and to explore the relationship between admission and discharge functional status and improvement.DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of data.SETTING: Acute rehabilitation unit of a large urban university-affiliated hospital.PARTICIPANTS: Inpatients with stroke (N=72; mean age, 70y; median time poststroke, 8.5d) and mild neurologic (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 4) and cognitive deficits (median MMSE score, 25).INTERVENTION: Not applicable.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Admission cognitive status was assessed by using the MMSE and MoCA. The motor subscale of the FIM instrument (mFIM) and motor relative functional efficiency was used to assess discharge functional status and improvement.RESULTS: The MoCA classified more persons as cognitively impaired than the MMSE (89% vs 63%, respectively; using a cutoff score of 27 on the MMSE and 26 on the MoCA). The MoCA also showed less of a ceiling effect than the MMSE, higher internal reliability (Cronbach a=.78 compared with a=.60), and marginally stronger associations with discharge functional status (r=.40; P&lt;.001) than the MMSE (r=0.30; P&lt;.05). The MoCA visuoexecutive subscore was the strongest predictor of functional status (P=.01) and improvement (P=.02) in global and subscores for both tests.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA may be an important cognitive screening tool for persons with stroke and mild cognitive dysfunction on an acute rehabilitation unit. Lower visuoexecutive subscores may assist in identifying persons at risk for decreased functional gains in self-care and mobility (mFIM) during inpatient rehabilitation. The findings justify further validation studies of the MoCA in persons with subacute stroke."
"21474808","Is the Montreal Cognitive Assessment superior to the Mini-Mental State Examination to detect poststroke cognitive impairment? A study with neuropsychological evaluation.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A screening test is required to improve the diagnosis of poststroke cognitive impairment. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a newly designed screening test, has been found to be more sensitive than Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), but its clinical value has not been established by means of a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. This study was designed to assess the value of MoCA and MMSE to detect poststroke cognitive impairment determined by a neuropsychological battery.METHODS: Both screening tests and a neuropsychological battery were administered during the acute phase in 95 patients referred for recent infarct or hemorrhage. Raw MMSE and MoCA scores were used with published cutoffs and new cutoff scores for MMSE and MoCA were also computed after adjustment for age and education.RESULTS: Using raw scores, MoCA was more frequently impaired (P=0.0001) than MMSE. MoCA showed good sensitivity (sensitivity, 0.94) but moderate specificity (specificity, 0.42; positive predictive value, 0.77; negative predictive value, 0.76), whereas an inverse profile was observed for MMSE (sensitivity, 0.66; specificity, 0.97; positive predictive value, 0.98; negative predictive value, 0.58). Adjusted scores with new cutoffs (MMSE(adj) =24, MoCA(adj) =20) provided good sensitivity and very good specificity for both tests (MMSE(adj): sensitivity, 0.7, specificity, 0.97, positive predictive value, 0.98, negative predictive value, 0.61; MoCA(adj): sensitivity, 0.67, specificity, 0.9, positive predictive value, 0.93, negative predictive value, 0.57). On receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, areas under the curve of all scores were &gt;0.88.CONCLUSIONS: The previously reported high sensitivity of MoCA is associated with low specificity. Both screening tests are moderately sensitive to acute poststroke cognitive impairment. This study provides indications for the diagnosis of poststroke cognitive impairment."
"21365162","Nutritional status in older adults with mild cognitive impairment living in elderly homes in Cairo, Egypt.","OBJECTIVES: To delineate the difference in nutritional risk between older adults with normal cognitive function and mild cognitive impairment living in elderly homes.DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.SETTING: Three elderly homes in Cairo, Egypt.PARTICIPANTS: One hundred twenty older adults; men and women aged 60 years and older.MEASUREMENTS: Comprehensive geriatric assessment was done for every participant to evaluate medical, functional, cognitive and affective aspects. Nutritional status was assessed by using the mini-nutritional assessment (MNA). Nutritional deficit was considered to be present if the individuals were classified as malnourished or at nutritional risk by means of the MNA. The cognitive function was assessed by using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).RESULTS: MCI was identified in 46 (38.3%) of the participants. According to the MNA classification, 58 (48.3%) of the sample study was assessed as well nourished, 49 (40.8%) at risk of malnutrition and 13 (10.8%) as malnourished. Older adults with MCI had significantly higher frequency of being at risk of malnutrition or malnourished than those with normal cognition. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the associations between MCI and nutritional deficit remained significant after adjustment for age, illiteracy, female gender and depression.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that MCI may be associated with nutritional risk, which emphasizes the importance of early identification of nutritional status among individuals with MCI. It remains to be demonstrated whether improvement in nutritional status may improve the cognitive function or delay progression to dementia in these patients."
"21340519","Loss of callosal fibre integrity in healthy elderly with age-related white matter changes.","Age-related white matter changes (ARWMC) appear to correspond to a continuum from normal functioning to clinically overt neurological syndromes. Disturbance of the structural integrity of cerebral fibre tracts-the so-called cerebral network-by ARWMC might be one explanation for this development. From 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 34 healthy elderly subjects (60-82 years) we calculated the lesion volume of ARWMC and the area of the corpus callosum (CC). Gait, balance and cognition were assessed. We compared these findings in those with mild (n = 22) and advanced (n = 12) ARWMC and performed tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) to analyze white matter structural integrity. In subjects with advanced ARWMC, TBSS showed a significant decrease of fractional anisotropy (FA) in several large tracts of the white matter including the CC; total CC, CC2 and CC5 areas were significantly smaller. Despite these morphological changes, tests of gait, balance and cognition as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were in the normal range for both groups; only the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) detected executive and language dysfunction in those with advanced ARWMC. Loss of tissue integrity and atrophy of the CC secondary to spatially remote lesions in the peri- and paraventricular white matter in ARWMC appear to be already detectable in healthy elderly individuals."
"21310371","Screening for cognitive deficits using the Montreal cognitive assessment tool in outpatients =65 years of age with heart failure.","There is strong evidence to suggest that heart failure (HF) is an independent risk factor for cognitive impairment (CI). The combination of CI and HF is associated with increased mortality, repeat hospitalization, and poor quality of life. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the presence of CI in older patients with HF using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a brief screening instrument for CI. We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study using the MoCA in outpatients with HF who were = 65 years of age. Forty-four patients (mean ± SD 76 ± 6.6 years of age) completed the MoCA. More than 70% of patients scored below the MoCA cutoff score of 26, suggesting the presence of CI. However, 91% of patients with New York Heart Association classes III to IV versus 52% of patients with classes I to II had a MoCA score &lt; 26 (p = 0.004). Patients with a recent hospital admission were more likely to have a MoCA score &lt; 26 versus patients without a recent hospital admission (89% vs 62%, respectively, p &lt; 0.045). Cognitive domain subscores showing significant differences (p &lt;0.01) were short-term memory, visuospatial function, executive function, and language. In conclusion, this study sample represented a group of older patients with HF and no suspected or documented CI, but screening with the MoCA detected CI in &gt;70% of the sample. The presence of CI was significantly more common in patients with advanced HF symptoms or a recent hospitalization. Future studies need to determine if the MoCA can identify the presence of CI that is predictive of adverse clinical outcomes in the HF population."
"21229776","[Applicability and validity of the Dutch version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (moCA-d) in diagnosing MCI].","OBJECTIVE: The MoCA is a new screening test to detect Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Purpose of this study is validating the Dutch version (MoCA-D).METHOD: We administered the MoCA-D to healthy control subjects and to elderly with MCI or dementia from a memory disorder outpatient clinic and a geriatric (outpatient) clinic (n = 30, 32, 37 respectively, age &gt; or = 60). Neuropsychological testing was part of the standard procedure for patients to diagnose MCI. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values (positive: PPV and negative: NPV) of the MoCA-D were assessed.RESULTS: A significant effect of group was found on MoCA-D total score (F (2.95) =67.9; p &lt; 0.01). With a cutoff score of &lt; or = 25, sensitivity and specificity to detect MCI in relation to healthy controls were 72% and 73%, respectively. PPV and NPV were 84% and 56%, respectively. With a cut-off score of &lt; or = 20, sensitivity to detect dementia in relation to MCI was 100% for severe dementia and 75% for mild dementia. Specificity for dementia was 81%, PPV 94% and NPV 55%.CONCLUSION: The MoCA-D distinguishes between healthy elderly, MCI patients and dementia patients. However, in this study, insufficient sensitivity and poor specificity were found. For the present, applying a broader and flexible screening procedure in order to detect MCI seems a more useful method than the interpretation of one test result in particular."
"23161865","The effects of an aerobic and resistance exercise training program on cognition following stroke.","BACKGROUND: Cognitive benefits obtained from exercise in healthy populations support the idea that aerobic and resistance training (AT+RT) would confer benefit for poststroke recovery. However, there is little evidence regarding the effectiveness of such programs.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of a 6-month exercise program of AT+RT on cognition in consecutively enrolled patients with motor impairments =10 weeks poststroke.METHODS: Outcomes were measured before and after 6 months of AT+RT on 41 patients. Cognition was measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Secondary measures included evaluation of gas exchange anaerobic threshold (ATge), body composition by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and depressive symptoms by questionnaire.RESULTS: There were significant improvements in overall MoCA scores (22.5 ± 4.5 to 24.0 ± 3.9, P &lt; .001) as well as in the subdomains of attention/concentration (4.7 ± 1.7 to 5.2 ± 1.3, P = .03) and visuospatial/executive function (3.4 ± 1.1 to 3.9 ± 1.1, P = .002). There was a significant reduction in the proportion of patients meeting the threshold criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline compared with posttraining (65.9% vs 36.6%, P &lt; .001). In a linear regression model, there was a positive association between change in cognitive function and change in fat-free mass of the nonaffected limbs (ß = .002; P = .005) and change in attention/concentration and change in ATge (ß = .383; P = .001), independent of age, sex, time from stroke, and change in fat mass and depression score.CONCLUSION: A combined training model (AT+RT) resulted in improvements in cognitive function and a reduction in the proportion of patients meeting the threshold criteria for MCI. Change in cognition was positively associated with change in fat-free mass and ATge."
"23153550","Association of physical activity with the visuospatial/executive functions of the montreal cognitive assessment in patients with vascular cognitive impairment.","BACKGROUND: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is more suitable than the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for the detection of vascular cognitive impairment. In this study, we performed a correlation analysis of MoCA/MMSE scores with daily physical activity in patients with subcortical ischemic white matter changes.METHODS: Ten patients (average 75.9 ± 9.1 years old) with extensive leukoaraiosis detected on magnetic resonance imaging underwent cognitive testing, including the MMSE and the Japanese version of the MoCA (MoCA-J). Physical activity was monitored with the Kenz Lifecorder EX device (Suzuken, Nagoya, Japan) to assess daily physical activity in terms of caloric expenditure, motor activity, number of steps, and walking distance for 6 months. Correlations of individual physical activity with total and subscale scores of MMSE/MoCA-J or 6-month interval change of MoCA-J scores were assessed.RESULTS: The total or subscale scores of the MMSE did not correlate with any parameters of physical activity. However, the mean number of steps and walking distance significantly correlated with the total MoCA-J scores (r = .67 and .64, respectively) and its visuospatial/executive subscores (r = .66 and .66, respectively). The mean interval change of MoCA-J was + .6; those who improved number of steps (n = 4; 80.5 ± 3.0 years of age) had significantly preserved MoCA-J scores compared to those who did not (n = 6; 73.0 ± 11.6 years of age; +2.0 versus - .3; P = .016).CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MoCA is useful to detect a biologically determined specific relationship between physical activity and executive function. In addition, physical exercise, such as walking, may help enhance cognitive function in patients with vascular cognitive impairment of subcortical origin."
"23138443","Telephone assessment of cognition after transient ischemic attack and stroke: modified telephone interview of cognitive status and telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment versus face-to-face Montreal Cognitive Assessment and neuropsychological battery.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Face-to-face cognitive testing is not always possible in large studies. Therefore, we assessed the telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment (T-MoCA: MoCA items not requiring pencil and paper or visual stimulus) and the modified Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status (TICSm) against face-to-face cognitive tests in patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke.METHODS: In a population-based study, consecutive community-dwelling patients underwent the MoCA and neuropsychological battery &gt;1 year after TIA or stroke, followed by T-MoCA (22 points) and TICSm (39 points) at least 1 month later. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was diagnosed using modified Petersen criteria and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) determined for T-MoCA and TICSm.RESULTS: Ninety-one nondemented subjects completed neuropsychological testing (mean±SD age, 72.9±11.6 years; 54 males; stroke 49%) and 73 had telephone follow-up. MoCA subtest scores for repetition, abstraction, and verbal fluency were significantly worse (P&lt;0.02) by telephone than during face-to-face testing. Reliability of diagnosis for MCI (AUC) were T-MoCA of 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63-0.87) and TICSm of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.68-0.90) vs face-to-face MoCA of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.76-0.94). Optimal cutoffs were 18 to 19 for T-MoCA and 24 to 25 for TICSm. Reliability of diagnosis for MCI (AUC) was greater when only multi-domain impairment was considered (T-MoCA=0.85; 95% CI, 0.75-0.96 and TICSm=0.83, 95% CI, 0.70-0.96) vs face-to-face MoCA=0.87; 95% CI, 0.76-0.97).CONCLUSIONS: Both T-MoCA and TICSm are feasible and valid telephone tests of cognition after TIA and stroke but perform better in detecting multi-domain vs single-domain impairment. However, T-MoCA is limited in its ability to assess visuoexecutive and complex language tasks compared with face-to-face MoCA."

Although the AQ's validity and diagnostic accuracy has been established, its performance in comparison with other instruments has not. Thirty-nine amnestic mild cognitive impairment cases and 34 Alzheimer disease cases were matched on the basis of age, education, and sex to 73 cognitively normal individuals. The sample had a mean age of 82.54±7.77 years and a mean education level of 14.61±2.61 years. The diagnostic accuracy of the CDR Sum of Boxes, Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were compared with the AQ. The AQ correlated strongly with the CDR Sum of Boxes (r=0.79) and demonstrated similar diagnostic accuracy with the MoCA and MMSE. These results suggest that the AQ is comparable with other established informant-based and patient-based measures. "
"23137551","COST: Cognitive State Test, a brief screening battery for Alzheimer disease in illiterate and literate patients.","BACKGROUND: The aim was to develop a brief screening battery, Cognitive State Test (COST), for detecting the presence of dementia in both illiterate and literate patients and to assess its validity and reliability.METHODS: COST is a cognitive screening tool that consists of almost all cognitive domains. It takes 5-7 minutes to administer, and has a maximum score of 30. Data were obtained from 114 healthy volunteers and 74 Alzheimer dementia (AD) patients. Subjects' age divided into two groups: A1: &lt;65 years; and A2: =65 years and their education level divided into three groups: E1: illiterate; E2: 1-5 years; and E3: =6 years. For assessing concurrent validity, total COST score was compared to the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Basic Activities of Daily Living (BADL). Sensitivity and specificity were determined through a discriminant analysis using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Internal consistency was measured using Cronbach's coefficient a.RESULTS: For normal and AD subjects, mean age was 64.9±9.8 years (50 women and 64 men) and 67.2±13.2 years (55 women and 19 men), respectively. Schooling ranged from 0-15 years (mean 5.7±4.2 and 3.3±3.8 years, respectively), and 21 and 37 subjects were illiterate, respectively. The COST significantly and positively correlated with MMSE and MoCA, and significantly and inversely correlated with CDR, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and BADL. In the E1, E2, and E3 education groups, the optimal cut-off points of COST chosen for diagnosis of AD were 23/24 (sensitivity: 81%, specificity: 99%), 24/25 (sensitivity: 75%, specificity: 86%), and 26/27 (sensitivity: 77%, specificity: 84%), respectively. When illiterate and literate subjects were then pooled, the optimal cut-off score of COST was 24/25, which yielded a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 87%. Reliability of the COST was good (0.86).CONCLUSION: The COST is a valid and reliable screening battery for detection of dementia both in the illiterate and the literate Alzheimer patients."
"23114018","Overuse of paracetamol caffeine aspirin powders affects cerebral glucose metabolism in chronic migraine patients.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Overuse of analgesic plays a prominent role in migraine chronification. Paracetamol caffeine aspirin (PCA) powders are commonly used in Chinese migraineurs. This study investigated the effects of the specific combination analgesic on cerebral glucose metabolism in chronic migraine (CM).METHODS: 18F-FDG-PET was used to measure regional metabolism in all subjects. Brain metabolisms of CM patients with analgesic overuse (AO-CM; n=10), no analgesic overuse (NAO-CM; n=10), and no regimen (NR-CM; n=10) and 17 age- and gender-matched normal controls (NC) were compared using statistical parametric mapping. Then, all patients underwent brain MRI analysis within 7 days after PET scans, as well as MMSE and MoCA scale for cognitive function tests.RESULTS: Glucose metabolic changes in CM patients taking different dosage of analgesic during headache-free periods and clear distinctions in several brain regions were observed. Patients with AO-CM exhibited significant metabolic reductions in thalamus, as well as increased metabolism in middle temporal gyrus and insula relative to NR-CM and NAO-CM. However, in these regions, no difference was observed in AO-CM except for increased metabolism in the right insula relative to NC group.CONCLUSIONS: Overusing PCA powders affects regional brain glucose metabolism in CM. Increased metabolism in the right insula may be associated with recurrently overusing of PCA powders."
"23102617","Self-regulatory practices of drivers with Parkinson's disease: accuracy of patient reports.","BACKGROUND: Studies suggest that drivers with Parkinson's disease (PD) are more likely than controls to restrict their exposure and avoid challenging situations possibly to compensate for declining abilities; however it is questionable whether patient reports should be taken at face value. To address this issue, this study examined agreement between self-reported and actual driving practices in drivers with and without PD.METHODS: Two electronic devices (one with GPS) were installed in the vehicles of 26 drivers with PD (mean age 71.5 ± 6.8, 77% men) and 20 controls (mean age 70.6 ± 7.9, 80% men) for two weeks. Participants completed a questionnaire on usual driving patterns, scales on Situational Driving Frequency (SDF) and Avoidance (SDA), the MoCA and an interview.RESULTS: Self-estimates of distance driven (km) over the two weeks were inaccurate in both groups; however the tendency to under-estimate was more pronounced in PD drivers. Drivers with PD reported more self-restrictions (higher SDA scores, p &lt; .01; lower SDF scores, p &lt; .05), yet drove more at night, in bad weather, in rush hour and on highways than they reported. Drivers with PD had significantly lower MoCA scores overall (p &lt; .01) and on the memory subtest (p &lt; .05), however, MoCA scores were not correlated with self-reported restrictions, or actual driving distance in either group.CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that patient reports of driving behavior should not be taken at face value by researchers or clinicians. Patients with PD may be more likely than drivers in general to have problems with recall and possibly less awareness of their driving practices."
"23079403","Evaluation of a practical visual MRI rating scale of brain white matter hyperintensities for clinicians based on largest lesion size regardless of location.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Age-related white matter hyperintensities have prognostic implications, but no accepted clinical standard exists for their assessment. We propose a simple objective visual rating system by using 3T brain MR imaging.MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR imaging from 559 participants was processed by using an automated method to determine WMH volumes and evaluated with a new visual rating scale based on the single largest WMH lesion diameter regardless of location. The reproducibility of the visual system was assessed. The association of WMH visual scores and automated volumes was then compared with cognitive scores from the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, which was available for 510 participants.RESULTS: Inter-reader reproducibility was good for subsamples with both high (n=52) and low (n=40) prevalence of large automated WMH volumes (agreement of 67% and 87.5%, <U+03BA>=0.71 and 0.76, respectively). Correlation between increased WMH and cognitive deficit measurements was equal for our visual ratings and automated volumes (Spearman <U+03C1>=0.118 and 0.109; P values=0.008 and 0.014, respectively). The visual scale retained a significant association with MoCA score after adjusting for age, sex, and education (standardized ß=-0.087, P=.042).CONCLUSIONS: We propose a simple visual WMH scoring system suitable for use as a baseline evaluation in clinical practice."

The purpose of this study was to provide normative data for the MoCA in Japanese community-dwelling older people.METHODS: In a Japanese town, 1,977 participants aged 65 years or older (mean age 73.6 years; male 41.3%) completed MoCA tests. After descriptive and regression analyses, normative data were developed for MoCA scores in the population.RESULTS: The mean MoCA score observed (21.8 points) was lower than that for normal controls (27.4 points) in the original validation study of the MoCA. Additionally, 82.6% of MoCA scores fell below the standard cutoff of 26 points for detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The regression analysis showed that higher age and fewer years of formal education were associated with lower MoCA scores (p &lt; 0.001). Normative data for MoCA scores were presented with respect to age and education.CONCLUSION: This study provided normative data for the MoCA in a Japanese community-dwelling older population. This research also suggests that conventional use of the MoCA as a screening tool for MCI might be problematic in cultures different from that in which the cutoff was developed."
"25205992","Gender based variation in cognitive functions in adolescent subjects.","BACKGROUND: Cognition can be defined as all mental activities that are involved in acquisition, processing, storage and retrieval of information.PURPOSE: There is paucity of the data related to cognitive function amongst healthy adolescent age group which limits our ability to distinguish and compare cognitive changes that occur across the adult lifespan in female and male subjects separately and can provide some help to understand dementia related conditions.METHODS: Cognitive function was assessed in 100 healthy subjects of each sex of 17-20 years by using 'Montreal Cognition Assessment Test', a 10 minutes: 30-points test which is used in assessing a wide range of cognitive abilities on 7 subscales : 1) Visuospatial Skills, 2) Language, 3) Memory, 4) Attention, 5) Mathematical ability, 6) Abstraction, and 7) Orientation.RESULTS: Overall score (Male: 25.16 ± 1.8, Female: 25.72 ± 1.8) of cognition functions was statistically significantly higher in female adolescents (p=&lt;0.02).

"23013837","Blunted responses to heart failure symptoms in adults with mild cognitive dysfunction.","INTRODUCTION: Mild cognitive dysfunction is common among adults with heart failure (HF). We hypothesized that mild cognitive dysfunction would be associated with poor HF self-care behaviors, particularly patients' ability to respond to symptoms.METHODS: We analyzed data on 148 participants in an observational study of symptoms in adults with moderate-to-advanced HF. Mild cognitive dysfunction was measured with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; range, 0-30), using cutoff scores for the general population (26) and for adults with cardiovascular disease (24). Heart failure self-care management (evaluation and response to HF symptoms) was measured with the Self-care of HF Index, and consulting behaviors (calling a provider when symptoms occur) were measured using the European HF Self-care Behavior Scale-9. Generalized linear modeling and hierarchical linear modeling were used to quantify the relationship between MoCA cutoff scores and indices of HF self-care.RESULTS: The mean age of the sample was 57 ± 12 years, 61.5% were men, and 58.8% had class III/IV HF; the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 28% ± 12%. Using MoCA scores of 26 and 24, respectively, 33.1% and 14.2% of the sample had mild cognitive dysfunction. Controlling for common confounders, participants with MoCA scores lower than 26 reported self-care comparable with that of participants with MoCA scores of 26 or higher. Participants with MoCA scores lower than 24, however, reported 21.5% worse self-care management (P = 0.014) and 51% worse consulting behaviors (P &lt; 0.001) compared with participants with MoCA scores of 24 or higher.CONCLUSIONS: A disease-specific cutoff for mild cognitive dysfunction reveals marked differences patients' ability to recognize and respond to HF symptoms when they occur. Adults with HF and mild cognitive dysfunction are a vulnerable patient group in great need of interventions that complement HF self-care."
"23009126","The Beijing version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment as a brief screening tool for mild cognitive impairment: a community-based study.","BACKGROUND: A cross-sectional validation study was conducted in several urban and rural communities in Beijing, China, to evaluate the effectiveness of the Beijing version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-BJ) as a screening tool to detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among Chinese older adults.METHODS: The MoCA-BJ and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were administered to 1001 Chinese elderly community dwellers recruited from three different regions (i.e., newly developed, old down-town, and rural areas) in Beijing. Twenty-one of these participants were diagnosed by experienced psychiatrists as having dementia, 115 participants were diagnosed as MCI, and 865 participants were considered to be cognitively normal. To analyze the effectiveness of the MoCA-BJ, we examined its psychometric properties, conducted item analyses, evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the scale, and compared the scale with the MMSE. Demographic and regional differences among our subjects were also taken into consideration.RESULTS: Under the recommended cut-off score of 26, the MoCA-BJ demonstrated an excellent sensitivity of 90.4%, and a fair specificity (31.3%). The MoCA-BJ showed optimal sensitivity (68.7%) and specificity (63.9%) when the cut-off score was lowered to 22. Among all the seven cognitive sub-domains, delayed recall was shown to be the best index to differentiate MCI from the normal controls. Regional differences disappeared when the confounding demographic variables (i.e., age and education) were controlled. Item analysis showed that the internal consistency was relatively low in both naming and sentence repetition tasks, and the diagnostic accuracy was similar between the MoCA-BJ and the MMSE.CONCLUSIONS: In general, the MoCA-BJ is an acceptable tool for MCI screening in both urban and rural regions of Beijing. However, presumably due to the linguistic and cultural differences between the original English version and the Chinese version of the scale, and the lower education level of Chinese older adults, the MoCA-BJ is not much better than the MMSE in detecting MCI, at least for this study sample. Further modifications to several test items of the MoCA-BJ are recommended in order to improve the applicability and effectiveness of the MoCA-BJ in MCI screening among the Chinese population."

Improved cumulative logistic regression (ICLR) was used to analyze the determinants of AD patients with depression.RESULTS: 196 AD patients were investigated. Among the 196 AD patients, there were 60 (30.6%) males and 136 (69.4%) females, at 58 - 89 years of age (72.3 ± 6.0). Physical activity, diabetes, MoCA, hearing, economic sources and alcohol were related to the degree of depression of AD patients (P &lt; 0.10). The difference between &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;mild depression&quot; was smaller than difference between &quot;mild depression&quot; and &quot;severe depression&quot;.CONCLUSION: AD patients with mild depression were the target population for prevention and they were influenced by several factors listed above."
"22959678","A pilot study of psychometric properties of the Beijing version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease in China.","Cognitive dysfunction is one of the most critical clinical manifestations of Parkinson's disease (PD), and its accurate and efficient diagnosis is crucial for treatment. We evaluated the psychometric properties of the Beijing version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (BJ-MoCA) in 123 Chinese patients with idiopathic PD. The internal consistency and convergent validity of the BJ-MoCA were examined and psychometric characteristics of BJ-MoCA scores were analyzed in PD patients with ''normal'' Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. More than half (56.9%) of the patients with normal MMSE scores showed cognitive impairment in multiple cognitive domains, including visuospatial and executive functions, naming, attention, language, delayed recall, and orientation. The impaired delayed recall was less likely to occur in newly diagnosed patients, and the orientation ability in patients with early onset was rarely affected. The multivariate regression analysis revealed that the age of symptom onset and disease severity were independent predictors of cognitive impairment. Thus, the current findings demonstrate that the BJ-MoCA is a reliable tool for screening cognitive dysfunction in Chinese patients with idiopathic PD. It is more sensitive than the MMSE for screening early cognitive decline in non-memory dysfunction."
"22929565","Pulse pressure and mild cognitive impairment.","OBJECTIVE: Patients with suboptimal blood pressure (BP) control may remain with an elevated cardiovascular risk and risk for cognitive impairment. Pulse pressure (PP) assessed with ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) or self-measurement so far has been an underestimated risk factor for target organ damage.METHODS: One hundred and forty-eight patients were screened: 51 men (34.5%) and 97 women (65.5%), mean age 64.16<U+200A>±<U+200A>11.18 years and a mean hypertension history of 13.1<U+200A>±<U+200A>11.05 years. We gathered full medical and hypertension history, physical examination, laboratory screening and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Neuropsychological profile was assessed with tests (NPTs): Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).RESULTS: Regression analysis found a correlation between day and night PP and NPT results. Mann-Whitney Test (a less than 0.05) was used to find a significant difference (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.02 for MMSE) in the mean values of the NPT results between the groups with PP more than 50 and PP 50<U+200A> mmHg or less. The result was not age dependent. There was also a significant difference between mean values of day-PP (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.01) and night-PP (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.02) between patients with cognitive impairment and those without (respectively more than 55 <U+200A>mmHg and less than 55<U+200A> mmHg).CONCLUSION: Elevated PP during the day, the night or with self-measurement is correlated with cognitive impairment. It is a marker of large artery stiffness and target organ damage not only in the very elderly, but also in younger individuals (mean age 64.16 years)."
"22923608","Cognitive screening in the acute stroke setting.","BACKGROUND: current literature suggests that two-thirds of patients will have cognitive impairment at 3 months post-stroke. Post-stroke cognitive impairment is associated with impaired function and increased mortality. UK guidelines recommend all patients with stroke have a cognitive assessment within 6 weeks. There is no 'gold standard' cognitive screening tool. The Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) is more sensitive than the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in mild cognitive impairment and for cognitive impairment in the non-acute post-stroke setting and in a Chinese-speaking acute stroke setting.METHODS: a convenience sample of 50 patients, admitted with stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), were screened within 14 days, using the MoCA and the MMSE.RESULTS: the mean MoCA was 21.80 versus a mean MMSE of 26.98; 70% were impaired on the MoCA (cut-off &lt;26) versus 26% on MMSE (cut-off &lt;27). The MoCA could be completed in &lt;10 min in 90% of cases.CONCLUSION: the MoCA is easy and quick to use in the acute stroke setting. Further work is required to determine whether a low score on the MoCA in the acute stroke setting will predict the cognitive and functional status and to explore what the best cut-off should be in an acute post-stroke setting."
"22879115","Montreal cognitive assessment in assessing clinical severity and white matter hyperintensity in Alzheimer's disease with normal control comparison.","PURPOSE: Use Taiwanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in evaluating patients in different stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and correlate with white matter change.METHODS: Ninety-seven normal controls (NC), 52 very-mild AD (clinical dementia rating [CDR] = 0.5), 48 mild AD (CDR = 1) and 38 moderate AD (CDR = 2) patients were enrolled for the MoCA, Mini- Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Cognitive Assessment Screening Instrument (CASI). White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on brain MRI were visually rated and classified as deep or periventricular WMHs.RESULTS: In NC group, education (ß = 0.326) but not age (ß = -0.183, p = 0.069), was significantly related to MoCA score. However, while we added two points to the AD patients with less than 6 years education, the effects of education disappeared as compared with those of 7 years of education. For all educational levels, the cutoff value of MoCA for very-mild AD was 22/23 (sensitivity = 82.7%, specificity = 87.6%). No significant differences were found in the areas under the curves that differentiated NC from the patients with AD for MoCA and MMSE (differences = 0.008, p = 0.490), or for MoCA and CASI (differences = 0.023, p = 0.082). Total WMHs, frontal deep and periventricular WMHs were inversely correlated with the attention and delayed-recall subdomain.CONCLUSION: The MoCA is a good clinical tool for screening very-mild stage AD if the educational effects are carefully considered. The correlation between the executive subdomains with the frontal WMHs also makes it a useful tool for detecting subtle WMHs."
"22830073","Chinese-language montreal cognitive assessment for cantonese or mandarin speakers: age, education, and gender effects.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment Chinese-Language Los Angeles version (MoCA-ChLA) was developed and administered during an in-home interview to 1,192 participants (mean age 62.5 years, mean education 11.6 years) in a population-based Chinese American Eye Study (CHES) in Los Angeles. The MoCA-ChLA score (mean ± SD) was 23.8 ± 4.2 with little ceiling and no floor effects. The score increased with higher education, decreased with advancing age, and was not related to gender. Compared to the education 1-6 years group, the mean MoCA-ChLA score was 2.6 and 4.6 higher in the education 7-11 and 12-20 years groups, respectively. The Mandarin- (n = 612) and Cantonese- (n = 612) speaking subgroups performed comparably; Cronbach's alpha of the MoCA-ChLA score was 0.78 and 0.79 for these two groups, respectively. Item response theory analysis showed good discriminating power for executive function and memory. These properties support the MoCA-ChLA as a useful screening tool for aging and dementia studies for Mandarin or Cantonese speakers."
"22819353","Cutting a long story short: reaction times in acute stroke are associated with longer term cognitive outcomes.","BACKGROUND: The viability and usefulness of cognitive assessment in acute stroke have been questioned, with practical challenges arising from the focal nature of neurological deficits as well as heterogeneity in arousal state. We aimed to test whether acute measures of attention correlate with attentional function at 3 months post-stroke.METHODS: Patients with confirmed stroke completed 2 computerised cognitive tasks (CogState) within 2 weeks of stroke. The tasks were a simple reaction time task (Detection) and a choice reaction time task (Identification) that required a button press to visual stimuli (playing cards). Each task took approximately 4 min. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and an extended neuropsychological battery were administered at 3 months post-stroke.RESULTS: Thirty-three patients (mean age 75.5 years, SD 11.9) participated in this preliminary study. Correlations indicated that both Detection speed (r=-0.73, p&lt;0.001) and Identification speed (r=-0.61, p=0.007) at baseline were associated with attentional function at 3 months, as measured by established neuropsychological tests (Trails-A, Digit span, Digit symbol). In addition, Detection speed at baseline was correlated with total 3-month MoCA score (r=-0.54, p=0.012).CONCLUSION: Simple and brief computerised assessment of attentional function in acute stroke is possible and is related to longer term attentional and cognitive performance."
"22814193","Leptin and cognition.","BACKGROUND: Leptin has been reported to have positive effects on cognition but has not been studied in a population-based sample or stratified by race or gender.METHODS: Leptin and fat mass were measured in 2,731 subjects, including 50% African Americans. Eight years later, subjects were administered the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Demographic factors and baseline measures, including a deficiency in leptin or levels in excess of what was predicted by fat, were investigated to see which predicted cognitive performance.RESULTS: There was a statistical trend for lower leptin levels to be associated with higher cognitive scores. Once stratified by race and gender, excessive leptin was associated with lower MoCA total scores and delayed recall domain score for black men, but white men demonstrated a reverse relationship.CONCLUSION: Excess leptin appears to have differential effects on delayed recall in black and white men."
"22797211","Alternate-form reliability of the Montreal cognitive assessment screening test in a clinical setting.","AIMS: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has gained recognition for its validity in detecting cognitive impairment in several clinical populations. For serial assessments, alternate forms are needed to overcome possible practice effects. Our objective was to investigate the reliability of two German MoCA alternate forms for longitudinal assessment applications.METHODS: The original and one of two alternate forms of the MoCA were administered within a 60-min interval of a clinical interview in a counterbalanced order to 100 healthy elderly controls, 30 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 30 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The diagnosis of the majority of patients was supported by in vivo AD pathology biomarkers.RESULTS: There was a strong correlation between the alternate forms and the original MoCA in all groups, but particularly in the clinical samples. Total mean scores did not differ significantly between the MoCA versions, even taking into account the presentation order. As in previous studies, age and education influenced performance in the MoCA. The same pattern of group differences (controls &gt; MCI &gt; AD) was observed for each of the versions.CONCLUSION: All three forms can be reliably and interchangeably used in serial cognitive assessment, confirming the MoCA's applicability in research and clinical longitudinal approaches."
"22759627","Differences in cognitive profile between TIA, stroke and elderly memory research subjects: a comparison of the MMSE and MoCA.","BACKGROUND: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) appears more sensitive to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) than the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE): over 50% of TIA and stroke patients with an MMSE score of =27 ('normal' cognitive function) at =6 months after index event, score &lt;26 on the MoCA, a cutoff which has good sensitivity and specificity for MCI in this population. We hypothesized that sensitivity of the MoCA to MCI might in part be due to detection of different patterns of cognitive domain impairment. We therefore compared performance on the MMSE and MoCA in subjects without major cognitive impairment (MMSE score of =24) with differing clinical characteristics: a TIA and stroke cohort in which frontal/executive deficits were expected to be prevalent and a memory research cohort.METHODS: The MMSE and MoCA were done on consecutive patients with TIA or stroke in a population-based study (Oxford Vascular Study) 6 months or more after the index event and on consecutive subjects enrolled in a memory research cohort (the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing). Patients with moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment (MMSE score of &lt;24), dysphasia or inability to use the dominant arm were excluded.RESULTS: Of 207 stroke patients (mean age ± SD: 72 ± 11.5 years, 54% male), 156 TIA patients (mean age 71 ± 12.1 years, 53% male) and 107 memory research subjects (mean age 76 ± 6.6 years, 46% male), stroke patients had the lowest mean ± SD cognitive scores (MMSE score of 27.7 ± 1.84 and MoCA score of 22.9 ± 3.6), whereas TIA (MMSE score of 28.4 ± 1.7 and MoCA score of 24.9 ± 3.3) and memory subject scores (MMSE score of 28.5 ± 1.7 and MoCA score of 25.5 ± 3.0) were more similar. Rates of MoCA score of &lt;26 in subjects with normal MMSE ( =27) were lowest in memory subjects, intermediate in TIA and highest after stroke (34 vs. 48 vs. 67%, p &lt; 0.001). The cerebrovascular patients scored lower than the memory subjects on all MoCA frontal/executive subtests with differences being most marked in visuoexecutive function, verbal fluency and sustained attention (all p &lt; 0.0001) and in stroke versus TIA (after adjustment for age and education). Stroke patients performed worse than TIA patients only on MMSE orientation in contrast to 6/10 subtests of the MoCA. Results were similar after restricting analyses to those with an MMSE score of =27.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA demonstrated more differences in cognitive profile between TIA, stroke and memory research subjects without major cognitive impairment than the MMSE. The MoCA showed between-group differences even in those with normal MMSE and would thus appear to be a useful brief tool to assess cognition in those with MCI, particularly where the ceiling effect of the MMSE is problematic."

One hundred and fifty-seven middle-aged type 2 diabetic patients were enrolled in this cross-section study (age 40~69, mean age 55 ± 7). There were 93 patients with MCI (MoCA score&lt;26) in MCI group and 64 with normal cognitive function (MoCA score = 26) in control group. Information of history of disease, family history, data of BMI, WHR, HbA1c, FINS, C-Peptide (C-P), SBP, DBP, blood lipid (TG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C and carotid ultrasound (carotid IMT, carotid resistance index [RI]) was collected.RESULTS: There were significant differences in the rate of patients with hypertension ([40.63 vs. 58.06%], P=0.026), duration of diabetes mellitus ([3.09 ± 4.04 y vs. 4.80 ± 4.94 y], P=0.024), C-P ([2.79 ± 1.09 ng/ml vs. 2.26 ± 1.00 ng/ml], P=0.008), Max C-IMT ([0.81 ± 0.15 mm vs. 0.91 ± 0.15 mm], P&lt;0.001), Min C-RI (0.71 ± 0.06 vs. 0.68 ± 0.06, P&lt;0.05), and no significant differences in the duration of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, BMI, WHR, HbA1c, SBP, DBP and blood lipid between control group and MCI group. MoCA scores were positively correlated with C-P (r=0.252, P=0.005), and negatively correlated with the history of hypertension (r=-0.244, P=0.002), duration of DM (r=-0.161, P=0.044), Max C-IMT (r=-0.253, P=0.005) and Min C-RI (r=-0.183, P=0.023). Multiple regression analysis showed that history of hypertension (Beta=-0.267, P=0.002), C-P (Beta=0.281, P=0.001) and Min C-RI (Beta=-0.221, P=0.011) were significantly independent determinants for the MoCA scores.CONCLUSIONS: The longer duration of diabetes, history of hypertension, lower serum C-P levels, thickened C-IMT and higher C-RI could be risk factors of MCI in type 2 diabetic patients. This finding could have an important impact on the management of cognitive decline in diabetic patients."
"22698678","Cross-cultural difference and validation of the Chinese version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment in older adults residing in Eastern China: preliminary findings.","To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Chinese Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-C) and assess cross-cultural differences in a community-based cohort residing in the Eastern China. The study included 72 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 84 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 146 cognitively normal controls. Sensitivities and specificities were calculated using the recommended cut-off scores. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to determine optimal sensitivity and specificity. Criterion validity, inter-rater, test-retest reliability and internal consistencies of the MoCA-C were examined, and clinical observations made. The influence of age, education level and gender on MoCA score was examined. Using the recommended cut-off score of 26, the area under the ROC (AUC) for predicting MCI groups using the MoCA-C was 0.930 (95%CI: 0.894; 0.965). The MoCA-C demonstrated 92% sensitivity and 85% specificity in screening for MCI. Cultural differences from the original MoCA affected the test response rate. The MoCA-C appears to have utility as a cognitive screen for early detection of AD and for MCI and warrants further investigation regarding its applicability in primary care settings in elderly Chinese people. It will be necessary to revise the contents of the questionnaire to account for by local characteristics."
"22692724","Changes on brief cognitive instruments over time in Parkinson's disease.","Two hundred and twenty-one subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) were examined using the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), with a subset of these (n = 98) examined on repeat testing up to 3 years. The MoCA was more sensitive in identifying cognitive deficit, specifically in the domains of visuospatial abilities, language, and memory. In longitudinal study, the MMSE changed significantly over time, particularly in patients with disease duration of &gt;10 years. The MoCA, however, did not change significantly, even when subjects were stratified by age, MMSE score, and disease duration. This suggests that the MoCA may be more sensitive for detecting early cognitive change in PD, but that the MMSE, and not the MoCA, may be better for tracking cognitive decline."
"22581594","Clinical application of the Polish adaptation of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test in screening for cognitive impairment.","MATERIAL AND METHODS: A group of 115 subjects (36 meeting DSM-IV criteria for Alzheimer disease (AD) [Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) = 1], 42 meeting Petersen's criteria for MCI [CDR = 0.5], and 37 cognitively intact controls [CDR = 0]) was recruited for the study in the university-based Alzheimer out-patient clinic. All participants underwent general medical, neurological, and psychiatric examinations. The MoCA, the MMSE, CDR and the short (15-item) version of the Geriatric Depression Scale were also applied.RESULTS: Both MCI and AD groups exhibited impaired performance on MoCA compared to controls. Polish versions of the MMSE and MoCA tests were comparable in discriminating mild dementia from both MCI and control groups. The Polish version of the MoCA test performed marginally better than MMSE in discriminating MCI from controls. We propose to use the MoCA test to screen for MCI using an optimal cut-off score of 24 and to screen for dementia using a cut-off score of 19.CONCLUSIONS: The Polish version of the MoCA seems effective in the detection of deteriorated cognitive performance and appropriate for differentiating impaired from preserved cognitive function in a Polish population."
"22522445","Symptoms of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are associated with cholinergic denervation in Parkinson disease.","OBJECTIVE: Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is common in Parkinson disease (PD), but its relationship to the varied neurotransmitter deficits of PD and prognostic significance remain incompletely understood. RBD and cholinergic system degeneration are identified independently as risk factors for cognitive impairment in PD. We aimed to assess the association between cholinergic denervation and symptoms of RBD in PD patients without dementia.METHODS: Eighty subjects with PD without dementia (age, 64.6 ± 7.0 years; range, 50-82 years; 60 males, 20 females; mean Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test [MoCA] score, 26.2 ± 2.1; range 21-30) underwent clinical assessment, neuropsychological testing, and [(11)C]methylpiperidyl propionate acetylcholinesterase and [(11)C]dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ) vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. (11)C3-Amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethyl-phenylsulfaryl)-benzonitrile (DASB) serotonin transporter PET imaging was performed in a subset of 35 subjects. The presence of RBD symptoms was determined using the Mayo Sleep Questionnaire.RESULTS: Twenty-seven of 80 subjects (33.8%) indicated a history of RBD symptoms. Subjects with and without RBD symptoms showed no significant differences in age, motor disease duration, MoCA, Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale motor scores, or striatal DTBZ binding. Subjects with RBD symptoms, in comparison to those without, exhibited decreased neocortical, limbic cortical, and thalamic cholinergic innervation (0.0213 ± 0.0018 vs 0.0236 ± 0.0022, t = 4.55, p &lt; 0.0001; 0.0388 ± 0.0029 vs 0.0423 ± 0.0058, t = 2.85, p = 0.0056; 0.0388 ± 0.0025 vs 0.0427 ± 0.0042, t = 4.49, p &lt; 0.0001, respectively). Brainstem and striatal DASB binding showed no significant differences between groups.INTERPRETATION: The presence of RBD symptoms in PD is associated with relative neocortical, limbic cortical, and thalamic cholinergic denervation although not with differential serotoninergic or nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation. The presence of RBD symptoms may signal cholinergic system degeneration."
"22490733","[Characteristics of cognitive impairment in patients with leukoaraiosis].","OBJECTIVE: To explore the characteristics of cognitive impairment in patients with leukoaraiosis (LA).METHODS: Forty-six LA patients and 38 age and gender-matched healthy subjects were recruited from the Department of Neurology, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University between September 2010 and March 2011. All participants underwent the neuropsychological tests recommended by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network Vascular Cognitive Impairment Harmonization Standards (NINDS/CSN). The were divided into 3 different groups (mild, moderate and severe) according to the Fazekas scale. The differences of neuropsychological performances were compared among 3 groups.RESULTS: The LA patients were associated with comprehensive cognitive function deficits, including MMSE (24.4 ± 3.2 vs 28.3 ± 1.2), MoCA (20.4 ± 3.0 vs 26.2 ± 0.8), digital span forward (5.7 ± 0.9 vs 6.8 ± 1.0), digital span backward (3.5 ± 0.7 vs 4.1 ± 0.7), Stroop-B (69 ± 13 vs 43 ± 5), Stroop-C (141 ± 42 vs 65 ± 10), trail making test-A (73 ± 15 vs 31 ± 7), trail making test-B (126 ± 18 vs 82 ± 6) and digit symbol test (25 ± 6 vs 37 ± 5, P &lt; 0.05). However, there was no difference in the performance of verbal fluency (12.7 ± 2.5 vs 13.4 ± 2.5, P &gt; 0.05). Correlation analysis showed that the severity of LA had a negative correlation with the performance of MoCA (r = -0.601, P = 0.002).CONCLUSIONS: The LA patients are closely correlated with cognitive impairments of attention, memory, executive function and information processing speed. It may be attributed to the frontal-subcortical circuitry dysfunction."

All of them were discharged within 14 days after the initiation of topiramate treatment. The topiramate dose range was 50-300 mg/day. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used on day 0, day 29, day 57, and day 85. Differences of the MoCA total and seven subtest scores among four time-points were compared.RESULTS: Thirty-eight participants (36 men and two women) had a mean ± SD age of 43.1 ± 8.6 years old. At enrollment, they were abstinent for a mean ± SD of 11.5 ± 5.3 days. Five, one, and three patients dropped out of the study on day 29, day 57, and day 85, respectively. On day 85, the mean ± SD dose of topiramate was 253.1 ± 60.8 mg/day. Alcohol consumption decreased drastically during follow up. At each time-point, 75%-80% of the participants were continuous abstainers. The mean ± SD MoCA total, language subtest, and delayed recall subtest scores increased significantly from day 0 to day 85, from 22.0 ± 4.7 to 24.7 ± 3.4 (P &lt; 0.01), from 1.1 ± 1.0 to 1.3 ± 1.0 (P = 0.03), and from 2.7 ± 1.7 to 4.1 ± 1.0 (P &lt; 0.01), respectively.CONCLUSION: Topiramate-treated patients recently detoxified from alcohol usually have an improvement of their cognitive function, especially in the language and delayed recall domains. This phenomenon may be caused by the greater influence of cognitive recovery associated with decreased drinking as compared with topiramate-induced cognitive impairment."
"22353375","Cognitive and affective impairments of a novel SCA/MND crossroad mutation Asidan.","BACKGROUND: A variety of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) develops a broad spectrum of both ataxia and non-ataxia symptoms. Cognitive and affective changes are one such non-ataxia symptoms, but have been described only in hereditary SCAs with exonic CAG gene expansion.METHODS: We newly found intronic hexanucleotide GGCCTG gene expansion in NOP56 gene as the causative mutation (=SCA36) in nine unrelated Japanese familial SCA originating from Asida river area in the western part of Japan, thus nicknamed Asidan for this mutation. These patients show unique clinical balance of cerebellar ataxia and motor neuron disease (MND), locating on the crossroad of these two diseases. In the nine families, 14 patients were clinically examined and genetically confirmed to Asidan. In the present study, we examined cognitive and affective analyses on 12 patients (seven men and five women) who agreed to join the examination with average age at onset of 53.1 ± 3.2 years, average duration of 12.1 ± 5.2 years, and current average age at 65.1 ± 6.2 years.RESULTS: The 12 Asidan patients demonstrated a significant decrease in their frontal executive functions measured by frontal assessment battery (FAB) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) compared with age- and gender-matched controls, whilst mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Hasegawa dementia score-revised (HDS-R) were within normal range. The decline of frontal executive function was related to their disease duration and scale for the assessment and rating of ataxias (SARA). They also demonstrated mild depression and apathy. Single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) analysis showed that these Asidan patients showed decline of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in a particular areas of cerebral cortices such as Brodmann areas 24 and 44-46.CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the patients with Asidan mutation show unique cognitive and affective characteristics different from other hereditary SCAs with exonal CAG expansion or MND."

Socio-demographic characteristic data including gender, age, education level, height, weight waist circumference and blood pressure, past history of coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and unhealthy habit of smoking and drinking, were investigated. The patient levels of fasting plasma glucose, fast insulin glycated, hemoglobin and blood lipids were measured on the next day. All subjects were evaluated with regards to the scores of Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), clinical memory scale (CMS), daily living skills assessment (ADL) and Hamilton depression scale (HAMD).RESULT: (1) MCI was more frequently detected in MS subjects than that in the healthy controls (24.4% vs 1.2%); (2)the scores of general MoCA and several parts of MoCA were lower in the MS subjects (scores of general 26.8 ± 0.5, EF4.40 ± 0.04, NAM2.60 ± 0.06, MEM3.60 ± 0.20, ATT5.60 ± 0.09, LANG2.60 ± 0.08, ABS1.50 ± 0.10, ORT5.40 ± 0.13)than those of the controls (scores of general 27.6 ± 0.4, EF4.50 ± 0.05, NAM2.70 ± 0.08, MEM4.20 ± 0.11, ATT5.70 ± 0.08, LANG2.60 ± 0.09, ABS1.60 ± 0.07, ORT5.40 ± 0.10). No statistically significant differences existed in the scores of general MoCA and several parts except for memory and abstract (P &gt; 0.05).

And the differences had statistical significance (P &lt; 0.05); (3) a high degree of education was a protective factor of MCI (OR = 0.512, P = 0.011) while diabetes, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome were the independent risk factors of MCI (OR(1) = 4.240, P(1) = 0.014; OR(2) = 7.230, P(2) = 0.023; OR(3) = 8.620, P(3) = 0.001).CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome are the independent risk factors of MCI."
"22306380","Suitability of the Montreal cognitive assessment versus the mini-mental state examination in detecting vascular cognitive impairment.","The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) has been criticized as being an insufficient screening test for patients with vascular cognitive impairment because of its insensitivity to visuospatial and executive functional deficits. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was designed to be more sensitive to such deficits, and thus may be a superior screening instrument for vascular cognitive impairment. Twelve patients with extensive leukoaraiosis detected on magnetic resonance imaging (average age, 76.0 ± 8.7 years) underwent neurologic and cognitive testing, including MMSE and the Japanese version of the MoCA (MoCA-J). Accepted cutoff scores of &lt;27 for the MMSE and &lt;26 for the MoCA-J were taken to indicate cognitive impairment. Z-scores were calculated to evaluate the discriminating ability of individual MMSE and MoCA-J subtest scores. Although there was a strong correlation between the total MMSE and total MoCA-J scores (r = 0.90; P &lt; .0001), MMSE scores were skewed toward the higher end of the range (range, 18-30; median, 28), whereas MoCA-J scores were normally distributed (range, 9-28; median, 21). Of the 7 patients with an unimpaired MMSE score, 6 (86%) had an impaired MoCA-J score. Z-scores were &gt;5 for 4 MMSE subtests (orientation, registration, naming, and language) but for only 1 MoCA-J subtest (naming). The MoCA-J better discriminated cognitive status in subjects with extensive leukoaraiosis. Our findings suggest that the MoCA-J is more sensitive than the MMSE in screening for cognitive impairment in patients with subcortical vascular cognitive impairment. "
"22277128","Montreal Cognitive Assessment: influence of sociodemographic and health variables.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a brief cognitive instrument for screening milder forms of cognitive impairment. The present study aimed to analyze the influence of sociodemographic (age, gender, educational level, marital and employment status, geographic region, geographic localization, and residence area) and health variables (subjective memory complaints of the participant and evaluated by the informant, depressive symptoms, and family history of dementia) on the participants' performance on the MoCA. The investigation was carried out in a Portuguese community-based sample of 650 cognitively healthy adults, who were representative of the distribution observed in the Portuguese population. Educational level and age significantly contributed to the prediction of the MoCA scores, explaining 49% of the variance. Regarding health variables, only the subjective memory complaints of the participant showed a small contribution (9%) to the variance on the MoCA scores. This study contributes a useful approach to understanding MoCA performance, stressing the great impact of education and age on scores."
"22258041","Montreal Cognitive Assessment in cryptogenic epilepsy patients with normal Mini-Mental State Examination scores.","This cross-sectional study examined the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) performance in cryptogenic epileptic patients aged more than 15 years with normal global cognition according to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. We tested our hypothesis that the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment and associated patient correlation factors might be increased (score &lt; 26) according to the MoCA, in spite of a normal MMSE score, and that cognitive impairment might occur in a range of domains of the MoCA. Eighty-five patients participated in this study. The mean MoCA score was 22.44 (± 4.32). In spite of a normal MMSE score, which was an inclusion criterion, cognitive impairment was detected in 60% patients based on the MoCA score. The variable that correlated with a higher risk of cognitive impairment was the number of antiepileptic drugs (polytherapy: OR 2.71; CI 1.03-7.15). The mean scores of visuospatial and executive function, naming ability, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall and orientation among patients with mild cognitive impairment were significantly lower than those of patients with normal cognitive function. These findings suggest that mild cognitive impairment in cryptogenic epileptic patients is common. We suggest using MoCA as a screening test for patients with epilepsy."

Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was performed to determine optimal sensitivity and specificity of the 12 points MoCA in differentiating cognitively impaired patients and controls.RESULTS: The mean 12 points MoCA scores of the controls and MS patients were 11.56 ± 0.67 and 8.06 ± 1.99, respectively. In our study, the optimal cut-off value for 12 points MoCA to be able to differentiate patients with cognitive impairments from controls is 10/12. Accordingly, 73.3% patients fell below the cut off value. Both the groups did not have significant statistical differences with regard to age and educational years.CONCLUSION: The 12 points, short version of MoCA, is a useful brief screening tool for quick and early detection of mild cognitive impairments in subjects with MS. It can be administered to patients having visual and motor problems. It is of potential use by primary care physicians, nurses, and other allied health professionals who need a quick screening test. No formal training for administration is required. Financial and time constraints should not limit the use of the proposed instrument."
"24314103","Is the Bahasa Malaysia version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-BM) a better instrument than the Malay version of the Mini Mental State Examination (M-MMSE) in screening for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the elderly?","INTRODUCTION: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a known precursor to Alzheimer disease, yet there is a lack of validated screening instruments for its detection among the Malaysian elderly.OBJECTIVE: To compare the Bahasa Malaysia version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-BM) with the Malay version of the Mini Mental State Examination (M-MMSE) in the detection of MCI among the Malaysian elderly.METHODOLOGY: This is a cross-sectional study conducted at the primary care centre of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur from December 2011 to mid-January 2012. Subjects aged 60 and above were recruited using systematic sampling method. Cut-off scores of 22/23 for MoCA-BM and 25/26 for M-MMSE were adopted. Kappa value and Pearson's correlation coefficient were used to ascertain the correlation between MOCA-BM and M-MMSE. Data were analysed using Mann-Whitney and Chi Square tests.RESULTS: The mean age of the 180 subjects enrolled was 65.3 years (SD=5.4). They had a median of 6 years (IqR 25-75=5-11) total formal education. The prevalence of MCI using MoCA-BM and M-MMSE was 55.6% and 32.8% respectively. The odds of developing MCI were 1.153 (95% CI=1.055, 1.261; p&lt;0.05) for every 1 year increase in age, 0.813 (95% CI=0.690, 0.959; p&lt;0.05) with every extra year of education. Increasing age and lower education level were significantly associated with MCI. The MoCA-BM showed good internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha of 0.80. It had moderate correlation with M-MMSE (Pearson correlation coefficient=0.770, p&lt;0.001) and moderate agreement for detecting MCI with Kappa values of 0.497 (p&lt;0.001).CONCLUSION: The prevalence of MCI was higher using MoCA-BM compared to M-MMSE. Both instruments showed moderate concordance for screening MCI with correlation of their scores."
"24323708","Early MoCA-assessed cognitive impairment after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and relationship to 1-year functional outcome.","Recent clinical research into aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) has confirmed the long-term effect of cognitive dysfunction on functional outcomes. We hypothesized that early cognitive impairment was a marker of permanent brain injury and hence predicted long-term functional outcome. Hong Kong Chinese patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were evaluated prospectively by means of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in the subacute phase (2-4 weeks after aSAH) and by neuropsychological evaluation of functional outcomes in the chronic phase (1 year after aSAH). This multi-center prospective observational study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov of the US National Institutes of Health (NCT01038193). One hundred and eight patients completed both the subacute and chronic phase assessments. Cognitive dysfunction in the subacute phase independently correlated with functional outcomes at 1 year, after adjusting for age, admission clinical condition, treatment modality, motor score, and mobility in the subacute phase, but the positive predictive values remained low. MoCA-assessed cognitive impairment in the subacute phase cannot accurately predict functional outcomes at 1 year. Future study should focus on understanding the relative importance of different components of early cognitive impairment."

"24293764","Electroencephalographic findings related with mild cognitive impairment in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder.","STUDY OBJECTIVES: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and electroencephalographic (EEG) slowing have been reported as common findings of idiopathic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and a-synucleinopathies. The objective of this study is to clarify the relation between MCI and physiological markers in iRBD.DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.SETTING: Yoyogi Sleep Disorder Center.PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-one patients with iRBD including 17 younger patients with iRBD (younger than 70 y) and 17 control patients for the younger patients with iRBD.INTERVENTIONS: N/A.MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and n-polysomnogram (PSG) were conducted of all participants. In patients with iRBD, the factors associated with MCI were explored among parameters of REM sleep without atonia (RWA), score of Sniffin' Sticks Test (threshold-discrimination-identification [TDI] score), RBD morbidity, and RBD severity evaluated with the Japanese version of the RBD questionnaire (RBDQ-JP). The younger iRBD group showed significantly lower alpha power during wake and lower MoCA score than the age-matched control group. MCI was detected in 13 of 17 patients (76.5%) on MoCA in this group. Among patients wtih iRBD, the MoCA score negatively correlated with age, proportion of slow wave sleep, TDI score, and EEG spectral power. Multiple regression analysis provided the following equation: MoCA score = 50.871-0.116*age -5.307*log (d power during REM sleep) + 0.086*TDI score (R² = 0.598, P &lt; 0.01). The standardized partial regression coefficients were -0.558 for age, -0.491 for log (d power during REM sleep), and 0.357 for TDI score (F = 9.900, P &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Electroencephalographic slowing, especially during rapid eye movement sleep and olfactory dysfunction, was revealed to be associated with cognitive decline in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder."
"24273722","An investigation of changes in regional gray matter volume in cardiovascular disease patients, pre and post cardiovascular rehabilitation.","Cognitive function decline secondary to cardiovascular disease has been reported. However, little is known about the impact of coronary artery disease (CAD) on the aging brain macrostructure or whether exercise training, in the context of cardiovascular rehabilitation, can affect brain structure following a coronary event. This study employed voxel-based morphometry of high resolution structural MRI images to investigate; 1) changes in regional gray matter volume (GMV) in CAD patients compared to age-matched controls, and 2) the effects of a six-month exercise-based cardiovascular rehabilitation program on CAD-related GMV decline. Compared to controls, significant decreases in regional GMV were found in the superior, medial and inferior frontal gyrus; superior and inferior parietal gyrus; middle and superior temporal gyrus and in the posterior cerebellum of CAD patients. Cardiovascular rehabilitation was associated with the recovery of regional GMV in the superior frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus and posterior cerebellum of the CAD patients as well as the increase in GMV in the supplementary motor area. Total and regional GMV correlated with fitness level, defined by the maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), at baseline but not after cardiovascular rehabilitation. This study demonstrates that cardiovascular disease can adversely affect age-related decline in GMV; and that these disease-related effects could be mitigated by moderate levels of exercise training as part of cardiovascular rehabilitation.

The objective of this study was to characterize the clinical phenotype of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) PD carriers of the LRRK2 G2019S mutation. We studied 553 AJ PD patients, including 65 patients who were previously reported, from three sites (two in New York and one in Tel-Aviv). Glucocerebrosidase (GBA) mutation carriers were excluded. Evaluations included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the Non-Motor Symptoms (NMS) questionnaire. Regression models were constructed to test the association between clinical and demographic features and LRRK2 status (outcome) in 488 newly recruited participants. LRRK2 G2019S carriers (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>97) and non-carriers (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>391) were similar in age and age at onset of PD. Carriers had longer disease duration (8.6 years vs. 6.1 years; P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001), were more likely to be women (51.5% vs. 37.9%; P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.015), and more often reported first symptoms in the lower extremities (40.0% vs. 19.2%; P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). In logistic models that were adjusted for age, disease duration, sex, education, and site, carriers were more likely to have lower extremity onset (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001), postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.043), and a persistent levodopa response for &gt;5 years (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.042). Performance on the UPDRS, MoCA, GDS, and NMS did not differ by mutation status. PD in AJ LRRK2 G2019S mutation carriers is similar to idiopathic PD but is characterized by more frequent lower extremity involvement at onset and PIGD without the associated cognitive impairment."
"24217342","Impact of different operational definitions on mild cognitive impairment rate and MMSE and MoCA performance in transient ischaemic attack and stroke.","BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is at least as prevalent as dementia after transient ischaemic attack (TIA)/stroke and is increasingly recognised as an important outcome in observational studies and randomised trials. However, there is no consensus on how impairment should be defined, and numerous different criteria exist. Previous studies have shown that different criteria for cognitive impairment impact on prevalence rates in epidemiological studies. However, there are few data on how operational differences within established criteria (e.g. Petersen-MCI) affect measured impairment rates and the performance of short cognitive tests such as the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), particularly in cerebrovascular disease. We therefore evaluated the effect of different operational definitions on measured rates of Petersen-MCI and on reliability of short cognitive tests in patients with TIA and stroke.METHODS: Consecutive patients underwent the MMSE, MoCA and neuropsychological battery =1 year after TIA or stroke in a population-based study. MCI was defined using the Petersen method and subclassified as single or multiple domain, both with (original) and without (modified) subjective memory impairment. Different cut-offs (&gt;1, &gt;1.5 and &gt;2 standard deviations, SD) on a given test relative to published norms were compared together with use of single versus multiple tests to define domain impairment.RESULTS: 91 non-demented subjects completed neuropsychological testing (mean age ± SD 69.7 ± 11.6 years, 54 male, 49 stroke) at a mean of 3.1 ± 1.9 years after the index event. Rates of cognitive impairment ranged from 14/91 (15%) for MCI-original at &gt;2 SD cut-off to 61/91 (67%) MCI-modified at &gt;1 SD cut-off, and the proportion of MCI that was multiple domain varied, e.g. 24/46 (52%) versus only 5/27 (20%) at 1 versus 2 SD cut-off for MCI-modified. Requirement for subjective memory complaint approximately halved estimates [e.g. 17 (19%) vs. 39 (43%) for MCI at 1.5 SD cut-off, single test definition], whereas use of multiple tests versus a single test to define a cognitive domain had less impact. In general, diagnostic accuracy was higher, and optimal cut-offs lower, on MMSE and MoCA for multiple-domain versus single-domain MCI, but the MoCA appeared superior for detecting MCI-modified, whereas the MMSE performed well in detecting MCI-original.CONCLUSION: Even within established criteria for MCI, differences in operational methodology result in 4-fold variation in MCI estimates. Optimal MMSE and MoCA cut-offs are lower, and reliability more similar, when criteria for MCI are more stringent. Our findings have implications for sample size and adjusted relative risk calculations in randomised trials and for comparisons between studies."
"24107412","Evidence of the sensitivity of the MoCA alternate forms in monitoring cognitive change in early Alzheimer's disease.","AIMS: There is an increasing interest in using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test as a monitoring tool in Alzheimer's disease (AD) in both research and clinical settings. Our aim was to investigate the utility of alternate forms of the MoCA in detecting cognitive deterioration in a sample of early AD patients followed longitudinally in an outpatient memory clinic.METHOD: Twenty-five patients with early-stage AD (prodromal or mild dementia) were administered the original version and one of two previously validated alternate forms of the MoCA within an interval of about 1 year. The decline over time and the rate of change of the MoCA were compared to the total score of a standardized neuropsychological assessment battery (Consortium to Establish a Registry of Alzheimer's Disease; CERAD-Plus). Responsiveness to change was determined by calculating standard response means and the respective effect sizes.RESULTS: Sixty percent of the sample showed a clinical decline on the clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale. There was significant deterioration in the MoCA and CERAD total scores.CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that the MoCA is capable of detecting change over time and seems to be a valid tool with small to moderate sensitivity for monitoring cognitive change in early AD."

A subset of 4,763 participants who underwent ECG recording during resting and paced breathing periods were used for the analysis. HRV indices were divided into quintiles for comparison of values and cognitive performance was defined using the Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA) score. Multivariate linear regression was used to model the association between cognition and different quintiles of each HRV index, after adjustment for covariates.RESULTS: The mean age was 61.7 ± 8.3 years and 2,618 (55 %) were female. Lower quintiles of SDNN (P = 0.01-paced), LF (P = 0.001-paced), and LF:HF ratio (P = 0.049-paced) were significantly associated with lower MOCA scores (during both recording periods), independent of confounders. Sub-domains of MOCA responsible for the relationship were predominantly memory recall and language.INTERPRETATION: Reduced HRV is significantly associated with lower cognitive performance at a population level in people aged 50 and older. This further strengthens the relationship between autonomic dysfunction and cognitive disorders."
"24077573","Usefulness of cube copying in evaluating clinical profiles of patients with Parkinson disease.","OBJECTIVE: To clarify the relationship between the quantitatively assessed cube-copying test (CCT) and clinical profiles of cognitive and motor ability in Chinese patients with Parkinson disease (PD).METHODS: We gave the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), which includes the CCT, to evaluate the cognitive function of 102 outpatients with PD. We also gave the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) II and III and the Hoehn-Yahr scale to evaluate the patients' motor function and disease severity, respectively. We used Maeshima's method for quantitative assessment of the CCT, and calculated CCT errors by adding incomplete connections and plane-drawing errors. We divided the patients into 2 groups based on normal (no errors) versus abnormal (=1 errors) CCT scores.RESULTS: We found 34 patients with normal scores and 68 with abnormal scores. The 2 groups had significant differences in age of onset, MoCA score, UPDRS II and III scores, and cognitive deterioration rate. CCT errors correlated inversely with cognitive domains except for orientation. Executive function was most commonly affected in both groups. We found correlations between numbers of CCT errors and left-limb movement, fine hand movement, postural instability and gait disorders, UPDRS II and III scores, and cognitive and motor deterioration rates.CONCLUSIONS: The quantitatively assessed CCT may be useful in estimating cognitive and motor dysfunction in patients with PD, and in monitoring disease progression."

"24004490","Electroencephalogram analysis: an early diagnostic method for assessing cognitive impairment after cerebral hemorrhage.","Cerebral hemorrhage may cause cognitive dysfunction. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a noninvasive diagnostic tool for assessment of cerebral function. A total of 174 patients (including cognitively impaired and cognitively normal) with cerebral hemorrhage, and 120 healthy persons (CN), were recruited between August 2008 and July 2012 at the Department of Neurology. EEG was used to analyze cerebral function of patients and normal persons. Correlation, clustering and concordance analyses were performed to analyze the relationship between EEG power and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores. Cognitively impaired patients had a significantly decreased EEG beta power (0.793 ± 0.176 µV(2)) compared with cognitively normal patients (1.589 ± 0.205 µV(2), P &lt; .01) or healthy persons (1.651 ± 0.185 µV(2), P &lt; .01).

"23988641","Test accuracy of short screening tests for diagnosis of delirium or cognitive impairment in an acute stroke unit setting.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Guidelines recommend cognitive screening in acute stroke. Various instruments are available, with no consensus on a preferred tool. We aimed to describe test accuracy of brief screening tools for diagnosis of cognitive impairment and delirium in acute stroke.METHODS: We collected data on sequential stroke unit admission in a single center. Four assessors trained in cognitive testing independently performed screening and reference tests. Brief assessments comprised the following: 10- and 4-point Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT-10; AMT-4); 4-A Test (4AT); Clock Drawing Test (CDT); Cog-4; and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). We also recorded the multidisciplinary team's informal review using single question (SQ). We compared against reference standards of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Confusion Assessment Method for delirium using usual diagnostic cutpoints. For MoCA, we described effects of lowering the diagnostic threshold to MoCA &lt;24 and MoCA &lt;20. We described sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values.RESULTS: Over a 10-week period, 111 subjects had cognitive assessment data. Subjects were 50% male (n=55), and median age was 74 years (interquartile range, 64-85). AMT-4, AMT-10, and SQ all had excellent (1.00) specificity for detection of cognitive impairment, although sensitivity was poor (all &lt;0.60). The 4AT had greatest sensitivity for detecting delirium (1.00 [confidence interval [CI], 0.74-1.00]) and reasonable specificity (0.82 [CI, 0.72-0.89]). Properties of 4AT for detection of cognitive impairment, at the traditional MoCA threshold, were also good (sensitivity, 0.86; specificity, 0.78). Using diagnostic thresholds of MoCA =26, &lt;24, and &lt;20 gave proportions with cognitive impairments of 86%, 61%, and 49%, respectively, with resulting changes in screening test properties. At lower MoCA thresholds, CDT had favorable sensitivity and specificity (MoCA &lt;20: sensitivity, 0.93, specificity, 0.66; MoCA &lt;24: sensitivity, 0.85, specificity, 0.77).CONCLUSIONS: Many brief screening assessments are specific but not sensitive for detection of cognitive impairment in acute stroke. Our primary analysis suggests that 4AT is a reasonable choice for delirium and cognitive screening in this setting. However, these data are based on standard MoCA diagnostic threshold and may not be suited for an acute stroke population."
"23986293","Electroencephalogram global field synchronization analysis: a new method for assessing the progress of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Global field synchronization (GFS) can measure functional synchronization in frequency-domain electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The aim of this study is to explore GFS values and its clinical significance for severity of cognitive decline in AD. EEGs were recorded from 37 AD patients and 37 age-matched healthy individuals. GFS values were calculated in delta, theta, alpha, beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, gamma, and full frequency bands. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) were employed to assess symptom severity in AD patients. Correlation analysis, clustering analysis, and concordance analysis were performed to analyze the relationship between GFS values and MoCA scores in AD patients. GFS values of the beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, and full bands were lower in AD patients than in healthy individuals, and positively correlated with MoCA and CDR scores in the combined group (AD patients and healthy individuals). GFS values were positively correlated with MoCA socres in 3 beta bands and full bands, and with CDR scores in the delta band. There was a good concordance between K-means clustering algorithm calculating of GFS values and MoCA scoring (<U+03BA> = .913, P &lt; .001). In conclusion, the present results indicated that GFS can serve as an indicator of cognitive decline or impairment in AD patients. Furthermore, the GFS method of EEG holds considerable promise to distinguish mild cognitive impairment from serious cognitive impairment in patients with AD. "
"23982512","Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are associated with cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetic adults.","Hypovitaminosis D is highly prevalent in type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study is to determine the serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] in type 2 diabetic patients with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and examine the relationship of 25(OH)D and MCI with other clinical factors. One hundred and sixty-five diabetic patients were enrolled in this study. Among whom, 95 patients were considered as MCI [Montreal Cognitive Assessment score (MoCA) &lt; 26] and the other 70 as no MCI (MoCA = 26). Subjects were assessed clinically. Diabetic patients with MCI had a longer duration of DM, fewer years of education, elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), resistant index (RI) of carotid, and lower levels of 25(OH)D {[17.35 (13.02-25.92) vs 28.00 (19.67-34.30)] ng/ml, P &lt; 0.001}. The MoCA score was positively correlated with log10[25(OH)D], education year, and inversely correlated with duration of DM, history of hypertension, intima-media thickness (IMT), FBG, max-RI, and min-RI. Log10[25(OH)D] was positively correlated with MoCA score, and inversely correlated with IMT, in multivariate regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, and education year, 25(OH)D (ß = 0.210, P = 0.003), history of hypertension (ß = -0.191, P = 0.007), IMT (ß = -0.194, P = 0.007), and FBG (ß = -0.157, P = 0.026) independently predicted MoCA score. In conclusion, our results suggest that levels of serum 25(OH)D are inversely associated with the cognitive impairment in diabetic patients. Vitamin D may be a potential protective factor for cognitive impairment in patients with type 2 diabetes."
"23968941","Correcting the MoCA for education: effect on sensitivity.","OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to quantify the impact of the suggested education correction on the sensitivity and specificity of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).METHOD: Twenty-five outpatients with dementia and 39 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) underwent a diagnostic evaluation, which included the MoCA. Thirty-seven healthy controls also completed the MoCA and psychiatric, medical, neurological, functional, and cognitive difficulties were ruled out.RESULTS: For the total MoCA score, unadjusted for education, a cut-off score of 26 yielded the best balance between sensitivity and specificity (80% and 89% respectively) in identifying cognitive impairment (people with either dementia or aMCI, versus controls). When applying the education correction, sensitivity decreased from 80% to 69% for a small specificity increase (89% to 92%). The cut-off score yielding the best balance between sensitivity and specificity for the education adjusted MoCA score fell to 25 (61% and 97%, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Adjusting the MoCA total score for education had a detrimental effect on sensitivity with only a slight increase in specificity. Clinically, this loss in sensitivity can lead to an increased number of false negatives, as education level does not always correlate to premorbid intellectual function. Clinical judgment about premorbid status should guide interpretation. However, as this effect may be cohort specific, age and education corrected norms and cut-offs should be developed to help guide MoCA interpretation."
"23952181","The effect of mydriatic solutions on cognitive function.","INTRODUCTION: Anticholinergic and sympathomimetic ophthalmic solutions are used for mydriasis. These solutions have well-documented systemic side effects despite their topical administration. However, no studies have been conducted regarding the effect of mydriatic drops on cognitive function. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect, if any, of mydriatic drops on cognitive function, including memory, concentration, and orientation.METHODS: Participants were randomized into two groups using the technique of permuted block randomization, and randomization was stratified by gender, age, and education. Participants in Group 1 completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test with undilated pupils, while participants in Group 2 completed the MoCA test with dilated pupils. Administration time of the MoCA test was approximately 10 minutes, and each participant could receive a maximum of 30 points, with a score of 26 or greater being considered normal cognitive function. Dilation was achieved in both eyes with a combination of tropicamide 0.5% and phenylephrine 2.5%.RESULTS: There was no statistical difference between the MoCA scores of Group 1 and Group 2 (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.65). In addition, MoCA scores were not statistically different between the glaucoma and non-glaucoma subpopulations within each group. MoCA test scores were shown to correlate with education (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.004), age (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0003), and race (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.03). Patients with confirmed or suspected glaucoma whom eyes dilated required 10.8 minutes to complete the MoCA test, while patients with no confirmed or suspected glaucoma whom eyes dilated required 8.5 minutes to complete the test (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02).DISCUSSION: Age, race, and education were found to be the most important factors affecting cognitive function in this study. There was no significant difference in the MoCA test scores of participants with confirmed or suspected glaucoma and participants without glaucoma. There was also no significant difference in the MoCA scores of dilated participants and non-dilated participants as a whole. However, dilation significantly increased the amount of time required to complete the MoCA test among the glaucoma and suspected-glaucoma population. The results of this study suggest that physicians should spend more time with dilated glaucoma patients while explaining medical conditions and treatment instructions in order to ensure that patients have adequate time to comprehend instructions for glaucoma management."

Those with &lt;26 in MoCA-J were divided into 2 subgroups, (A) participants independent of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and no memory complaints and (B) participants independent of IADL with memory complaints or partially dependent on IADL with/without memory complaints. Those with =26 in MoCA-J and subgroup (A) of MCI were the normal controls (NCs, 57.4%), and subgroup (B) of MCI was O-MCI, 36.5%. We compared each variable between NC and O-MCI, using logistic regression analysis, adjusted for gender and age.RESULTS: The majority of all the groups were independent of IADL. The O-MCI characteristics were increased depressive symptom, worse self-rated health, lower systolic blood pressure, poorer intellectual activities, no hobbies, weaker grip strength, and slower than usual walking speed compared to the NC group.CONCLUSIONS: Older persons with O-MCI defined by MoCA-J have partially decreased cognition and physical and sociopsychological functions."
"23919950","Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Mini-Mental State Examination performance in patients with mild-to-moderate dementia with Lewy bodies, Alzheimer's disease, and normal participants in Taiwan.","BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine and test the sensitivity, specificity, and threshold scores of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and determine those that best correspond to a clinical diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).METHODS: Sixty-seven Alzheimer's disease (AD), 36 DLB, and 62 healthy participants without dementia (NC), aged 60 to 90, were enrolled. All three groups took the MoCA and MMSE tests at the same time. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests and receiver operating characteristics curve analysis were used to compare the different neuropsychological test results among the groups.RESULTS: The cut-off point of the MoCA for AD was 21/22 with a sensitivity of 95.5% and a specificity of 82.3% (area under the curve (AUC): 0.945), and the cut-off point for DLB was 22/23 with a sensitivity of 91.7% and a specificity of 80.6% (AUC: 0.932). For the MMSE, the cut-off points for AD and for DLB from NC were all 24/25, with a sensitivity of 88.1% and a specificity of 85.5% for AD (AUC: 0.92), and a sensitivity of 77.8% and a specificity of 85.5% for DLB (AUC: 0.895). After controlling sex, age, and education, AD and DLB had lower scores in all MoCA subscales than the NC group (p &lt; 0.05), except for the orientation and naming in DLB. In addition, AD had a lower score in the MoCA orientation (p = 0.03) and short-term memory (p = 0.02) than did DLB.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA is a more sensitive instrument than the MMSE to screen AD or DLB patients from non-dementia cases."
"23912068","Eye Blink Rate as a biological marker of Mild Cognitive Impairment.","We investigated the relationship between dopamine activity (DA), as measured by Eye Blink Rate (EBR), and cognitive function in old adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and healthy controls. Research has been inconclusive so far about the factors responsible for the transition from MCI to dementia. However, some studies suggest that cortical hyperexcitability in very early stages of pathological aging may progressively lead to cell death, and thus to Alzheimer's disease. Hence, we speculated that a dysfunction of DA activity, as measured by EBR, may characterize people with MCI, and account for their poor cognitive function. Thirty three (33) healthy and thirty six (36) old adults with MCI (Mean age = 67.52 y.o.) participated in this study. The EBR was recorded under resting conditions, using two gold skin electrodes above and below the left eye. Cognitive function was assessed with a battery of neuropsychological tests. Participants with MCI showed significantly higher EBR than the healthy controls. Also, EBR was negatively related to scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment test (MoCA) test. We propose that abnormally increased dopamine activity, as indexed by relatively high EBR, may be partially responsible for the neurotransmitter imbalance in the central nervous system of people with MCI, and the overall impaired cognitive performance. In addition, this finding suggests that an abnormally high EBR may be a potential biomarker of the transition from healthy aging to dementia."
"23900081","Vascular cognitive impairment: most useful subtests of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in minor stroke and transient ischemic attack.","AIMS: Cognitive impairment is frequent in cerebrovascular disease but often remains undetected. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has been proposed in this context. Our aim was to evaluate the MoCA and its subtests in cerebrovascular disease.METHODS: We assessed 386 consecutive patients with minor stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Score &lt;4) or transient ischemic attack at 3 months. The MoCA and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were administered. Computed tomography (CT) scans were assessed for stroke and white matter changes. An unfavorable functional outcome was defined as mRS &gt;1.RESULTS: The prevalence of cognitive impairment (cutoff of 26) was 55% using the MoCA and 13% using the MMSE. In a multivariate analysis, MoCA &lt;26 was associated with the outcome (OR 3.00, CI 1.78-5.03), as were remote lacunar stroke on CT and white matter changes of at least moderate severity. Five subtests (5-word recall, word list generation, trail-making, abstract reasoning and cube copy) formed an optimal short MoCA with 6/10 or less showing a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 83%.CONCLUSION: This study extends the utility of the MoCA to milder forms of cerebrovascular disease. The MoCA is associated with the 3-month functional outcome. Five subtests may constitute an optimal brief tool in vascular cognitive impairment."
"23884868","[Mnemonic complaints and chronic migraine].","INTRODUCTION. Patients with chronic migraine often report lower cognitive performance, which affects their quality of life. AIMS. To analyse whether the mnemonic capacity of patients with chronic migraine is altered or not. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. A cross-sectional study was conducted in patients with chronic migraine evaluated consecutively in our unit, and paired by age (18-60 years) and gender with a control group consisting of cognitively healthy volunteers. The following cognitive instruments were administered: Folstein Minimental State Examination (MMSE), Memory Alteration Test (M@T), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and working memory. RESULTS. A total of 30 patients with chronic migraine were included (mean age: 49.33 ± 10.05 years) paired with a control group of 30 healthy volunteers (mean age: 44.83 ± 10.91 years). The mean elapsed time since onset of the patients with chronic migraine was 4.47 ± 2.74 years. On performing a comparative analysis between the two groups, significant differences were found with overall lower scores in the group of patients with chronic migraine in the MoCA (24.16 versus 29), M@T (43.76 versus 48.8) and working memory tests (17.5 versus 24.26). Performance in the MMSE was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS. Patients with chronic migraine can have lower cognitive performance regardless of distracting elements, such as pharmacological factors or psychiatric comorbidity, since chronic migraine can be understood as yet another element within the spectrum of chronic pain. Quejas mnesicas y migraña cronica.</AbstractText>: Quejas mnesicas y migraña cronica.Introduccion.

Analizar si existe alteracion en la capacidad mnesica de los pacientes con migraña cronica. Sujetos y metodos. Estudio transversal en pacientes con migraña cronica valorados de forma consecutiva en nuestra unidad, pareados en edad (18-60 años) y sexo con un grupo control constituido por voluntarios cognitivamente sanos. Se administraron los siguientes instrumentos cognitivos: test minimental de Folstein (MMSE), test de alteracion de memoria (T@M), evaluacion cognitiva de Montreal (MoCA) y memoria de trabajo. Resultados. Se incluyo un total de 30 pacientes con migraña cronica (edad media: 49,33 ± 10,05 años) pareados con un grupo control de 30 voluntarios sanos (edad media: 44,83 ± 10,91 años). El tiempo medio de evolucion de los pacientes con migraña cronica fue de 4,47 ± 2,74 años. Al realizar el analisis comparativo entre ambos grupos, se encontraron diferencias significativas con puntuaciones mas bajas de forma global en el grupo de pacientes con migraña cronica en el test de MoCA (24,16 frente a 29), T@M (43,76 frente a 48,8) y memoria de trabajo (17,5 frente a 24,26). El rendimiento en el MMSE fue similar en ambos grupos. Conclusiones. Los pacientes con migraña cronica pueden tener un menor rendimiento cognitivo independientemente de elementos distractores, como el farmacologico o la comorbilidad psiquiatrica, dado que la migraña cronica puede entenderse como un elemento mas dentro del espectro del dolor cronico."
"23820117","Mechanochemical ablation in patients with chronic venous disease: a prospective multicenter report.","BACKGROUND: There are several endovenous methods to ablate the saphenous vein, all of which require tumescent anesthesia. This report was designed to evaluate the efficacy of a tumescent-free technique using mechanochemical ablation (MOCA).METHODS: This was a prospective observational multicenter report on the efficacy of MOCA in selected patients with lower extremity chronic venous disease. Demographic information, clinical and procedural data were collected on a customized database. The distribution and extent of venous reflux and the closure rate of the treated veins were assessed with duplex ultrasound. Pain was evaluated during the procedure and postoperatively using an analog scale. The presence and severity of complications were recorded. Patient improvement was assessed by clinical-etiology-anatomy-pathophysiology (CEAP) class and venous clinical severity score (VCSS).RESULTS: There were 126 patients that were included at baseline, 81% females, with a mean age of 65.5<U+2009>±<U+2009>14 years. The average BMI was 30.5<U+2009>±<U+2009>6. The mean diameter of the great saphenous vein in the upper thigh was 7.3<U+2009>mm and the mean treatment length was 38<U+2009>cm. Adjunctive treatment of the varicosities was performed in 11% of patients during the procedure. Closure rates were 100% at one week, 98% at three months, and 94% at six months. Post-procedure complications included hematoma 1%, ecchymosis 9%, and thrombophlebitis 10%. There were no cases of venous thromboembolism. There was significant improvement in VCSS (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) for all time intervals.CONCLUSION: MOCA of the saphenous veins has the advantage of endovenous ablation without tumescent anesthesia, making it an almost pain-free procedure. High occlusion rates with significant clinical improvement can be achieved with this method at short term."
"23733350","Cognitive function and self-care management in older patients with heart failure.","AIMS: People with heart failure have difficulty with self-care management. We do not know if patients with heart failure have difficulty with self-care management due to underlying, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The purpose of this study was to determine whether MCI, as identified on a simple screening tool, is significantly associated with self-care management in a sample of community dwelling older patients with heart failure.METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a cross-sectional design, heart failure patients (n=100, mean age 72 SD 10 years) attending an outpatient heart failure clinic completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment tool (MoCA), Self-Care in Heart Failure Index (SCHFI) and Geriatric Depression Scale. The presence of MCI, as defined by a MoCA score &lt;26, was present in 73% patients; 21% had an adequate self-care management SCHFI score; and 12% reported symptoms of depression. Participants with a MoCA score &lt;26 vs. = 26 scored significantly lower on the self-care management subscale of the SCHFI (48.1 SD 24 vs. 59.3 SD 22 respectively, p=0.035). Using backward regression, the final model was fitted to self-care management while controlling for age and sex and was significant, with (F= 7.04 df (3, 96), and p&lt;0.001), accounting for 18% of the total variance in self-care management (R (2) = 18.03%). The MoCA score was the only variable which remained in the model significantly with p= 0.001.CONCLUSION: Findings from this study highlight the difficulty older heart failure patients have with self-care management and the need to include formal screening for MCI when exploring variables contributing to self-care management in heart failure patients."
"23716072","Predictive value of MoCA in the acute phase of stroke on the diagnosis of mid-term cognitive impairment.","Post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) includes all forms of cognitive decline that develop after stroke, even if not severe enough to fit the criteria of dementia. Our aims were to investigate the predictive value of a brief bedside examination (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA) in the acute phase of stroke on the diagnosis of mid-term PSCI, taking into account other clinical, cognitive, functional, and neuroimaging predictors. Consecutive patients admitted to a stroke unit were evaluated with MoCA between 5 and 9 days after stroke. At baseline, clinical, functional, and neuroimaging data were collected. Patients were reassessed between 6 and 9 months after stroke by means of an extensive neuropsychological and functional evaluation. Out of 137 enrolled stroke patients, 80 (58.4%) were followed up (mean age 68.2 ± 14.6 years, males 66%, mean NIHSS score 3.6 ± 4.8). PSCI was diagnosed in 47 patients (59%; 35 mild cognitive impairment, 12 dementia). Controlling for age, education, functional and cognitive pre-morbid status, stroke severity, and pre-existing lacunar infarcts, MoCA baseline score [OR (95% CI) = 1.4(1.1-1.8)] for each point] and leukoaraiosis severity [OR (95% CI) = 0.4(0.2-0.9)] for each point of the van Swieten scale] were independently associated with PSCI. Using a ROC analysis, a cut-off of 21 predicted the diagnosis of PSCI with 91.4 % sensitivity, 75.8 % specificity, 80 % positive predictive value, and 89.3 % negative predictive value. In a sample of mild stroke patients, MoCA seems to be a good predictor of mid-term PSCI, making it a possible candidate for a brief cognitive screening in the acute stroke setting."
"23676378","Relationship between EEG beta power abnormality and early diagnosis of cognitive impairment post cerebral hemorrhage.","Cerebral hemorrhage is a common disease of older adults, which could increase the risk of cognitive impairment. Electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics can be analyzed to investigate the applied value in the assessment of cognitive impairment of the patients with cerebral hemorrhage. One hundred eighty-two patients (including patients with cognitive impairment [CHCI] and patients with cognitive normality [CHNC] with cerebral hemorrhage, and 120 normal healthy persons [control; CN]) were recruited between July 2008 to March 2012 at the department of neurology. All patients were analyzed by EEG, and analysis results were compared to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale, using the methods of correlation analysis, clustering analysis, and concordance analysis. The results indicated that patients with CHCI had significantly lower EEG beta power (0.814 ± 0.113 mcV(2)) relative to CHNC (1.601 ± 0.186 mcV(2), P &lt; .01) or CN group (1.713 ± 0.201 mcV(2), P &lt; .01). Significant negative correlation was found between the beta power and hemorrhage region, age, hemorrhage size, hemorrhage amount (r 1 = -.92223, r 2 = -.81084, r 3 = -.79258, r 4 = -.84961, respectively, all P &lt; .001). There was good concordance between K-means clustering algorithm calculating the beta power and MoCA scoring (Kappa = 0.899, P &lt; .001). In conclusion, the preliminary findings suggest that the recognition techniques of EEG hold considerable promise for the assessment of cognitive impairment post cerebral hemorrhage, which negatively related to the hemorrhage region, hemorrhage size, hemorrhage amount, and age.

"23662720","Normative values of cognitive and physical function in older adults: findings from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing.","OBJECTIVES: To provide normative values of tests of cognitive and physical function based on a large sample representative of the population of Ireland aged 50 and older.DESIGN: Data were used from the first wave of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), a prospective cohort study that includes a comprehensive health assessment.SETTING: Health assessment was undertaken at one of two dedicated health assessment centers or in the study participant's home if travel was not practicable.PARTICIPANTS: Five thousand eight hundred ninety-seven members of a nationally representative sample of the community-living population of Ireland aged 50 and older. Those with severe cognitive impairment, dementia, or Parkinson's disease were excluded.MEASUREMENTS: Measurements included height and weight, normal walking speed, Timed Up-and-Go, handgrip strength, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Color Trails Test, and bone mineral density. Normative values were estimated using generalized additive models for location shape and scale (GAMLSS) and are presented as percentiles, means, and standard deviations.RESULTS: Generalized additive models for location shape and scale fit the observed data well for each measure, leading to reliable estimates of normative values. Performance on all tasks decreased with age. Educational attainment was a strong determinant of performance on all cognitive tests. Tests of walking speed were dependent on height. Distribution of body mass index did not change with age, owing to simultaneous declines in weight and height.CONCLUSION: Normative values were found for tests of many aspects of cognitive and physical function based on a representative sample of the general older Irish population."
"23603179","Value of the MoCA test as a screening instrument in multiple sclerosis.","OBJECTIVE: Since a large proportion of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients exhibit cognitive deficits, it is important to have reliable and cost-effective screening measures that can be used to follow patients effectively. the objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical value of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test in detecting cognitive deficits in MS patients.METHODS: Forty-one (70.1% women, mean age 44.51 ±7.43) mildly impaired (EDSS: 2.26 ±1.87) MS patients were recruited for this study. In addition to the MoCA, they were administered the MSNQ-P (patient version) and the MSNQ-I (informant version), the bDI-FS and a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery.RESULTS: there were significant correlations between the MoCA test and the three factors derived from the neuropsychological evaluation (Executive/speed of processing, Learning, Delayed recall). the MoCA test was correlated with the MSNQ-I but only marginally with the MSNQ-P. In addition, there was no significant correlation between the MSNQ-P and the neuropsychological factors, whereas significant correlations were found between two of those factors (Learning and Delayed recall) and the MSNQ-I, suggesting that the informant version is more reliable than the patient version for the presence of cognitive deficits.CONCLUSION: the results obtained in the present study support the value of the MoCA test as a screening tool for the presence of cognitive dysfunction in MS patients, even in patients with mild functional disability (EDSS)."
"23601097","The relationship between cognitive performance, perceptions of driving comfort and abilities, and self-reported driving restrictions among healthy older drivers.","The objective of the present study was to examine the relationship between cognitive performance, driver perceptions and self-reported driving restrictions. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on baseline data from Candrive II, a five-year prospective cohort study of 928 older drivers aged 70-94 years from seven cities. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as well as the Trail Making Test, parts A and B. Driver perceptions were assessed using the Day and Night Driving Comfort Scales and the Perceived Driving Abilities scale, while driving practices were captured by the Situational Driving Frequency and Avoidance scales, as well as the Driving Habits and Intentions Questionnaire. The baseline data indicates this cohort is largely a cognitively intact group. Univariate regression analysis showed that longer Trails A and B completion times were significantly, but only modestly associated with reduced driving frequency and perceived driving abilities and comfort, as well as a significant tendency to avoid more difficult driving situations (all p&lt;.05). Most of these associations persisted after adjusting for age and sex, as well as indicators of health, vision, mood and physical functioning. Exceptions were Trails A and B completion times and situational driving frequency, as well as time to complete Trails B and current driving restrictions. After adjusting for the confounding factors, the total MoCA score was not associated with any of the driving measure scores while the number of errors on Trails A was significantly associated only with situational driving frequency and number of errors on Trails B was significantly associated only with situational driving avoidance. Prospective follow-up will permit examination of whether baseline cognition or changes in cognition are associated with changes in driver perceptions, actual driving restrictions and on-road driving outcomes (e.g., crashes, violations) over time.

"23584853","Premorbid IQ influence on screening tests' scores in healthy patients and patients with cognitive impairment.","Cognitive screening tests are well-established tools for detecting cognitive impairment, but concerns regarding the influence of premorbid intelligence on patient's performance and cognitive status classification remain. Risk of inaccurate assessment especially affects the elders with high or low premorbid intelligence (who are more likely to be misclassified). The present study examines the influence of premorbid intelligence assessed by the TeLPI (an irregular words reading test) on 2 cognitive screening tests, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), in healthy participants and patients with cognitive impairments (mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease). Results show that premorbid IQ influences the MMSE and the MoCA scores in both the groups, predicting variance from 8.4% to 33.2%, according to test and group analyzed. Hence, we propose that whenever the MMSE or the MoCA is used, premorbid IQ evaluation should also be considered to ensure correct interpretation and classification."
"23577654","Assessment of cognitive function in adult patients with hemorrhagic moyamoya disease who received no surgical revascularization.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Due to controversial surgical treatment for hemorrhagic moyamoya disease (MMD), a large proportion of these patients chose conservative treatment. The aim of this study was to assess cognitive function in adult patients with hemorrhagic MMD who received no surgical revascularization.METHODS: Twenty-six adult hemorrhagic MMD patients with only intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) confirmed by positive computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scan, 20 patients with spontaneous IVH whose digital subtraction angiography results were negative, and 30 healthy controls were identified and matched for age, gender, education background and living area. Cognitive function was evaluated by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The non-parametric test was used for comparisons among the three groups.RESULTS: No patient was confirmed cognitive dysfunction at the initial screening. Twenty-four (92%) cases presented mild cognitive impairment (MCI) after 1 year. All the cases demonstrated MCI after 2 years. The difference between cases and healthy controls was statistically significant at the second screening (P = 0.000) and the third screening (P = 0.000), as was that between cases and patients with spontaneous IVH at the second screening (P = 0.000) and the third screening (P = 0.000). In addition, there were significant decreases in all MoCA subscores (P = 0.000) with special regards to delayed recall, visual space and executive function in cases compared with the other two groups. Moreover, significant differences were found in the subgroups of smoking (P = 0.021) and Suzuki angiographic classification of MMD (P = 0.030).CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairment is a long-term complication for adult hemorrhagic MMD patients who underwent conservative treatment."
"23548916","The NeuroAiD II (MLC901) in vascular cognitive impairment study (NEURITES).","BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of patients after nondisabling stroke are cognitively impaired compared to age- and education-matched community-dwelling controls. Moreover, poststroke patients who have 'vascular cognitive impairment no dementia' (VCIND) of moderate severity have a high risk of incident dementia, dependency and death. Further studies are urgently needed to demonstrate effective cognition-enhancing therapies in VCIND given the scarcity of evidence-based treatment options. NeuroAiD is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been shown to induce neuroplasticity, promote cell proliferation and stimulate the development of dense axonal and dendritic networks in animal stroke models. NeuroAiD may improve cerebral blood flow and functional recovery after stroke in patients.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects and tolerability of NeuroAiD II in patients with VCIND.METHODS: The NeuroAiD II (MLC901) in Vascular Cognitive Impairment Study (NEURITES) is a 24-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase II study of NeuroAiD II in patients with VCIND. The primary outcome is executive function as measured by the Verbal Fluency test. Secondary outcomes include cognitive assessments such as the ADAS-Cog, MoCA, MMSE and Cognitive Battery: activities of daily living as measured by the Alzhei-mer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scale for mild cognitive impairment, behavior as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and depression as measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale and the Beck Depression Scale. In addition, there will be novel exploratory outcomes: (a) magnetic resonance imaging of lesion location (structural imaging), structural integrity of white matter pathways (diffusion tensor imaging), neuronal function (resting studies) and perfusion (arterial spin labeling and MR angiography), and (b) retinal and optic nerve imaging. Safety and tolerability will be assessed using adverse events, laboratory tests and vital signs.CONCLUSIONS: NEURITES has the potential to set new standards for the systematic evaluation of Asian traditional medicine for integration into standard medicine practice and establishing a novel therapeutic approach for improving cognition after stroke."
"23569023","Relationship between cerebral microbleeds and cognitive function in lacunar infarct.","OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the impact of cerebral microbleeds on cognitive function. This study investigated the distribution of cerebral microbleeds and their impact on cognitive function, in patients with lacunar infarct.METHODS: Patients with lacunar infarct were enrolled prospectively. Cerebral microbleeds were classified as absent, mild, moderate or severe, based on magnetic resonance imaging findings. Cognitive function was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) questionnaire, with a total score of &lt;26 indicating cognitive impairment.RESULTS: Of the 85 patients included in the study, 35 (41.2%) had cerebral microbleeds. They were more frequently observed in mixed and deep brain regions, but rarely in the cerebral lobes. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that presence of cerebral microbleeds (odds ratio [OR] 5.320), duration of education (OR 0.938) and age (OR 1.464) were independent predictors of cognitive impairment. There was a significant correlation between cerebral microbleed severity and MoCA score.CONCLUSION: The number and location of cerebral microbleeds were both closely associated with cognitive impairment, in patients with lacunar infarct."

Mean MMSE scores declined only modestly across the decades; mean MoCA scores declined more dramatically. There were no consistent domain differences between the MMSE and MoCA during the third and fourth decades; however, significant differences in memory (P&lt;0.05) and language (P&lt;0.001) emerged in the fifth through ninth decades.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the MoCA may be a better detector of age-related decrements in cognitive performance than the MMSE, as shown in this community-dwelling adult population."
"23538053","Incremental value of biomarkers to clinical variables for mortality prediction in acutely decompensated heart failure: the Multinational Observational Cohort on Acute Heart Failure (MOCA) study.","AIM: This study aims to evaluate the incremental value of plasma biomarkers to traditional clinical variables for risk stratification of 30-day and one-year mortality in acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF).METHODS AND RESULTS: Through an international collaborative network, individual patient data on 5306 patients hospitalized for ADHF were collected. The all-cause mortality rate was 11.7% at 30 days and 32.9% at one year. The clinical prediction model (age, gender, blood pressure on admission, estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), sodium and hemoglobin levels, and heart rate) had a c-statistic of 0.74 for 30-day mortality and 0.73 for one-year mortality. Several biomarkers measured at presentation improved risk stratification when added to the clinical model. At 30 days, the net reclassification improvement (NRI) was 28.7% for mid-regional adrenomedullin (MR-proADM; p&lt;0.001) and 25.5% for soluble (s)ST2 (p&lt;0.001). At one year, sST2 (NRI 10.3%), MR-proADM (NRI 9.1%), amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP; NRI 9.1%), mid-regional proatrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP; NRI 7.4%), B-type natriuretic peptide (NRI 5.5%) and C-reactive protein (CRP; NRI 5.3%) reclassified patients with ADHF (p&lt;0.05 for all). CRP also markedly improved risk stratification of patients with ADHF as a dual biomarker combination with MR-proADM (NRI 36.8% [p&lt;0.001] for death at 30 days) or with sST2 (NRI 20.3%; [p&lt;0.001] for one-year mortality).CONCLUSION: In this study, biomarkers provided incremental value for risk stratification of ADHF patients. Biomarkers such as sST2, MR-proADM, natriuretic peptides and CRP, reflecting different pathophysiologic pathways, add prognostic value to clinical risk factors for predicting both short-term and one-year mortality in ADHF."
"23491024","Rapid and intermediate N-acetylators are less susceptible to oxidative damage among 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (MBOCA)-exposed workers.","OBJECTIVES: In this study, we explored the association between a marker of oxidative stress, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and genetic polymorphism of the carcinogen-metabolizing enzyme N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) among 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (MBOCA)-exposed workers.METHODS: The study population was recruited from four MBOCA-producing factories, and included 57 MBOCA-exposed workers and 101 unexposed control workers. Personal characteristics were collected by questionnaire. Plasma 8-OHdG levels were measured by LC/MS/MS. NAT2 alleles were measured by polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).RESULTS: NAT2 polymorphism influenced the plasma 8-OHdG levels of MBOCA-exposed workers, but not of non-exposed workers. No difference between exposed and control groups was found for the crude 8-OHdG levels among rapid, intermediate, and slow acetylators. After adjusting for gender, age, smoking, and alcohol consumption habit, the 8-OHdG concentration in the MBOCA-exposed workers was 0.18pg/ml (95% CI -1.80 to -0.12) lower than the control group among rapid and intermediate acetylators. However, the difference between exposed and control groups was not significant for slow acetylators.CONCLUSION: Gene-environment interactions could play a role in the carcinogenesis of occupational MBOCA exposure. We suggest that the impact of the NAT2 acetylator status is low, if at all, on the generation of the oxidative stress marker 8-OHdG in the investigated exposed group."
"23475372","Levels of metallic elements and their potential relationships to cognitive function among elderly from Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA) settlement in Selangor Malaysia.","Exposure to toxic metals and excessive amount of trace elements is a risk factor of cognitive decline. Continuous monitoring of these elements by the use of metabolically inactive tissues such as fingernails may help in taking preventive measures to delay the cognitive decline process. In this study, the cognitive function of 54 elderlies (60-72 years old) from FELDA Sungai Tengi, Selangor, was evaluated using the Malay version of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The levels of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) in fingernail were detected using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry. Results showed that (92.6 %) our population was cognitively impaired based on the MoCA with mean score of 18.07<U+2009>±<U+2009>5.11. The mean level of elements in fingernails for As, Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb, and Zn were 16.68<U+2009>±<U+2009>3.52, 4.26<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.91, 4.81<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.16, 1.00<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.23, 1.83<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.47, and 40.86<U+2009>±<U+2009>10.81 µg/g, respectively. Significant inverse correlations were observed between MoCA with age (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.543, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01), Cu level (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.330, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05), and Mn level (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.496, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01). MMSE was correlated to age (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.346, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05) only. In conclusion, besides aging, the progression of cognitive decline among the elderly FELDA population was associated with increased levels of copper and manganese."

However, it has not been validated for use on traumatic brain injury patients with intracranial haemorrhage (tICH). The aim was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the MoCA (MoCA) in such patients.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHOD: A cross-sectional observational study was carried out on 40 controls and 48 tICH patients recruited in Hong Kong. Concurrent validity was assessed by a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Criterion validity was assessed by the differentiation of tICH patients from controls.MAIN OUTCOME AND RESULTS: In tICH patients, cognitive z-scores (ß<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.579; p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) and MMSE (ß<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.366, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.012) significantly correlated with performance in the MoCA after adjustment for age, gender and total score for the Geriatric Depressive Scale. For the differentiation of tICH patients from controls, analysis of receiver operating characteristics curves in the MoCA revealed an optimal balance of sensitivity and specificity at 25/26 with an area under the curve of 0.704 (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001). MoCA is applicable to and significantly correlated with excellent neurological outcomes in tICH patients.CONCLUSIONS: MoCA is a useful and psychometrically valid tool for the assessment of gross cognitive function in tICH patients."
"23425001","Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Mini-Mental State Examination are both valid cognitive tools in stroke.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the validity of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) as screening tools for cognitive impairment after stroke.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cognitive assessments were administered over 2 sessions (1 week apart) at 3 months post-stroke. Scores on the MoCA and MMSE were evaluated against a diagnosis of cognitive impairment derived from a comprehensive neuropsychological battery (the criterion standard).RESULTS: Sixty patients participated in the study [mean age 72.1 years (SD = 13.9), mean education 10.5 years (SD = 3.9), median acute NIHSS score 5 (IQR 3-7)]. The MoCA yielded lower scores (median = 21, IQR = 17-24; mean = 20.0, SD = 5.4) than the MMSE (median = 26, IQR = 22-27; mean = 24.2, SD = 4.5). MMSE data were more skewed towards ceiling than MoCA data (skewness = -1.09 vs -0.73). Area under the receiver operator curve was higher for MoCA than for MMSE (0.87 vs 0.84), although this difference was not significant (<U+03C7>(2) = 0.48, P = 0.49). At their optimal cut-offs, the MoCA had better sensitivity than the MMSE (0.92 vs 0.82) but poorer specificity (0.67 vs 0.76).CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA is a valid screening tool for post-stroke cognitive impairment; it is more sensitive but less specific than the MMSE. Contrary to the prevailing view, the MMSE also exhibited acceptable validity in this setting."
"23419567","Screening for cognitive impairment in a stroke prevention clinic using the MoCA.","BACKGROUND: Screening for cognitive impairment is recommended in patients with cerebrovascular disease. We sought to establish the incidence of cognitive impairment using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in a cohort of consecutive patients attending our stroke prevention clinic (SPC), and to determine whether a subset of the MoCA could be derived for use in this busy clinical setting.METHODS: The MoCA was administered to 102 patients. Incidence of cognitive impairment was compared to presenting complaint and final diagnosis. extent of cerebral white matter changes (WMC) was rated using the Age Related White Matter Changes (ARWMC) scale in 80 patients who underwent neuroimaging. A subset of the three most predictive test elements of the MoCA was derived using regression analysis.RESULTS: 63.7% of patients scored &lt;26/30 on the MoCA, in keeping with cognitive impairment. This was unrelated to the final diagnosis or extent of WMC, although a trend for lower MoCA scores was observed in older patients. A mini-MoCA subscore combining the clock drawing test, five-word delayed recall, and abstraction was highly correlated with the final MoCA score (R=0.901). A score of &lt;7/10 using this 10-point mini-MoCA identified cognitive impairment as defined by the MoCA with a sensitivity of 98.5%, and a specificity of 77.6%.CONCLUSIONS: Two-thirds of SPC patients demonstrated evidence for cognitive impairment, irrespective of their final diagnosis or the presence of WMC. A mini-MoCA comprised of the clock drawing test, five-word delayed recall, and abstraction represents a potential alternative to the full MoCA in this population."

"23380993","The informant AD8 is superior to participant AD8 in detecting cognitive impairment in a memory clinic setting.","The informant AD8 has good discriminatory indices in detecting questionable dementia. However, studies on participant AD8 yielded inconsistent results. This study aims to investigate the discriminatory ability of the AD8 in detecting cognitive impairment at a memory clinic by comparing the informant AD8, participant AD8, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The AD8 was administered to 280 participant-informant dyads. The MoCA and MMSE were administered to all participants, who subsequently received a comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological assessment leading to a consensus diagnosis and a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to compare the discriminatory ability of AD8, MoCA, and MMSE. Participants were Chinese (83.6%) females (54.3%) with a mean age and education of 73.4 ± 8.6 years and 6.2 ± 5.6 years, respectively. The discriminant validity of the informant AD8 was significantly superior to the participant AD8 in detecting cognitive impairment (CDR = 0.5) {Area Under Curve (AUC) [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 0.96 (0.93-0.98) versus 0.66 (0.58-0.74), p &lt; 0.01}.

"23322976","Correlation between moca and mmse for the assessment of cognition in schizophrenia.","INTRODUCTION: Schizophrenia (Sch) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder associated with impairment of cognitive function as a central feature, which is confirmed by a number of studies performed on patients suffering from Sch, where clinical symptoms and social functioning of patients are consequences of neurocognitive deficits.GOAL: The goal of this study was to assess the clinical usability of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as a screening instrument for cognitive impairment in schizophrenic patients, alone and in correlation with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).MATERIAL AND METHODS: This clinical prospective study included 30 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Patients were selected from Psychiatric Clinic, Clinical Center University of Sarajevo (CCUS) during 2010. For assessment of cognitive impairment we used Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).RESULTS: From the total number of respondents (n=30), 15/30 (50 %) were males and 15/30 (50 %) were females; age of onset were 23.5±6.69; duration of illness before hospitalization (mean±SD) 32.5±12.9. If we make a comparison of MoCA scale and MMSE under the limit values, then we get that there was 10 true positive, 4 true negative, 14 false positive and 2 false negative. This all leads to sensitivity of MoCA scale again in comparison with the MMSE of 41.7%, specificity 66.7%, positive predictive value of 83.3% and negative predictive value of 22.2%.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide preliminary evidence that MoCA scale performs well in detecting true positive but it is imprecise in the detection of true negative findings."

Multiple deficits in cognitive domains were identified, most notably in executive functioning, visuospatial abilities and short-term memory. Predictors of MCI (age and sex-adjusted) were lower education level (technical/trade school level OR 6.00, 95% CI 2.07 to 17.42; &lt;8 years school education OR 5.29, 95% CI 1.95 to 14.36 vs 8-13 years), higher CHA2DS2-VASc score (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.74) and prescribed digoxin (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.17 to 4.10).CONCLUSIONS: MCI is highly prevalent amongst typically older high-risk patients hospitalised with AF. Routine assessment of cognitive function with adjustment of clinical management is indicated for this patient group."
"23292208","Factors predicting the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) applicability and performances in a stroke unit.","The evaluation of cognitive status is not routine in the acute stroke setting. We aimed to investigate feasibility, applicability, and performances of the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) in acute stroke patients. Consecutive stroke patients (ischemic or hemorrhagic) admitted to one stroke unit were evaluated 5-9 days after stroke with MoCA (score range: 0-30; higher scores indicate better cognitive performance). Pre-morbid functional and cognitive status was assessed by a structured interview to caregivers. Neuroimaging data regarding index stroke and pre-existing lesions were collected. From December 2009 to December 2010, out of 207 patients with stroke, 137 (66%) were enrolled [mean age 69.2 ± 14.8 years; males 62%; mean National Institute of Health and Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score 5.9 ± 7.9]. The most common reason for non-enrolment was unfitting the time window inclusion criteria. MoCA was entirely applicable to 113/137 (82.5%) patients and the mean score was 17.8 ± 7.1. Multivariate analyses showed that non-applicability was associated with higher NIHSS scores [OR (95% CI) = 1.4 (1.2-1.7) for each point], left sided lesions [OR (95% CI) = 18.8 (2.3-155.2)], and worse pre-morbid functional status [OR (95% CI) = 0.7 (0.6-0.9) for each point of the instrumental activity of daily living scale]. Factors influencing MoCA performance were low education (ß = 0.264, p &lt; 0.01), higher NIHSS scores (ß = -0.277, p &lt; 0.01) and worse pre-morbid functional status (ß = 0.504, p &lt; 0.001). MoCA administration is feasible in acute patients with mild-to-moderate stroke, with lesion location, stroke severity, and pre-morbid functional status as major determinants of its applicability and performance. MoCA seems to reveal some degree of cognitive deficit even in patients with mild stroke."

"25523313","Posterior brain white matter abnormalities in older adults with probable mild cognitive impairment.","OBJECTIVE: Much of the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) neuroimaging literature has exclusively focused on regions associated with Alzheimer's disease. Little research has examined white matter abnormalities of other brain regions, including those associated with visual processing, despite evidence that other brain abnormalities appear in these regions in early disease stages.METHOD: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was utilized to examine participants (n = 44) that completed baseline imaging as part of a longitudinal healthy aging study. Participants were divided into two groups based on scores from the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a brief screening tool for MCI. Participants who scored &lt;26 were defined as &quot;probable MCI&quot; while those who scored =26 were labeled cognitively healthy. Two DTI indices were analyzed including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). DTI values for white matter in the lingual gyrus, cuneus, pericalcarine, fusiform gyrus, and all four lobes were compared using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Regression analyses examined the relationship between DTI indices and total MoCA score.RESULTS: RESULTS revealed significantly lower FA in the probable MCI group in the cuneus, fusiform, pericalcarine, and occipital lobe, and significantly higher MD in the temporal lobe. Fusiform FA and temporal lobe MD were significantly related to total MoCA score after accounting for age and education.CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS indicate that there are posterior white matter microstructural changes in individuals with probable MCI. These differences demonstrate that white matter abnormalities are evident among individuals with probable MCI in regions beyond those commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease and anterior brain aging patterns."

Participants with a history of syncope and/or unexplained falls in the past 12 months were compared with those with no reported events. Cognitive performance was measured using the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) score. Multivariate linear regression analysis controlling for potential confounders was performed to compare cognitive function by syncope and falls status.RESULTS: Five thousand eight hundred and forty-six participants were analysed, median age 62 years (inter-quartile range=14), and 54% were female. Five hundred and forty-nine (9.4%) had a syncopal event and/or an unexplained fall in past 12 months. One hundred and two (1.8%) subjects had two-plus syncopal events in the same period. There was a significant association between syncope/falls history and lower MoCA score, following adjustment for all confounders (B=-0.4; -0.69, -0.11; P=0.006). Higher syncope burden was also associated with lower performance; however, this was largely explained by confounders. There was no age interaction with these findings.CONCLUSION: Participants who experienced syncope and/or non-accidental falls in the previous year have poor global cognitive performance compared with case-controls. There was no effect of age on our results. Further investigation of the association between syncope burden, unexplained falls and cognitive decline is required to establish a relationship between these disorders."

There is limited evidence on how to perform routine cognitive screening in HIV clinical settings. To address this, 44 HIV-positive males were recruited from a Veteran Affairs Infectious Disease clinic and completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS), and Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21. In all, 50% scored below the MoCA cutoff and 36% scored below the IHDS cutoff. Current CD4 was the strongest predictor of an abnormal MoCA score (P = .007, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.987-0.998) and elevated depression was the second strongest predictor (P = .008, CI: 1.043-1.326). Combination antiviral therapy use and age were not significant predictors in this model. The MoCA appeared to be a reasonable screening tool to detect cognitive impairment in HIV-positive patients, and although it is not sufficient to diagnose HAND, it has the potential to provide meaningful clinical data.

"25481217","A mobile application for cognitive screening of dementia.","Neuropsychological assessment tests have an important role in early detection of dementia. Therefore, we designed and implemented a test battery for mobile devices that can be used for mobile cognitive screening (MCS). This battery consists of 33 questions from 14 type of tests for the assessment of 8 different cognitive functions: Arithmetic, orientation, abstraction, attention, memory, language, visual, and executive functions. This test battery is implemented as an application for mobile devices that operates on Android OS. In order to validate the effectiveness of the neuropsychological test battery, it was applied on a group of 23 elderly persons. Within this group, 9 (of age 81.78±4.77) were healthy and 14 (of age 72.55±9.95) were already diagnosed with dementia. The education level of the control group (healthy) and dementia group were comparable as they spent 13.66±5.07 and 13.71±4.14 years at school respectively. For comparison, a validated paper-and-pencil test (Montreal Cognitive Test - MoCA) was applied along with the proposed MCS battery.

From the viewpoint of long-term continuity of activity, it is necessary to develop various cognitive stimulating programs. The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a cognitive intervention through a training program for picture book reading for community-dwelling older adults.METHODS: Fifty-eight Japanese older participants were divided into the intervention and control groups using simple randomization (n =29 vs 29). In the intervention group, participants took part in a program aimed at learning and mastering methods of picture book reading as a form of cognitive training intervention. The control group listened to lectures about elderly health maintenance. Cognitive tests were conducted individually before and after the programs.RESULTS: The rate of memory retention, computed by dividing Logical Memory delayed recall by immediate recall, showed a significant interaction (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.05) in analysis of covariance. Simple main effects showed that the rate of memory retention of the intervention group improved after the program completion (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.05). In the participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) examined by Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J) (n =14 vs 15), significant interactions were seen in Trail Making Test-A (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.01), Trail Making Test-B (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.05), Kana pick-out test (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.05) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.05).CONCLUSIONS: The intervention effect was found in delayed verbal memory. This program is also effective for improving attention and executive function in those with MCI. The short-term interventional findings suggest that this program might contribute to preventing a decline in memory and executive function.CTR: UMIN000014712 (Date of ICMJE and WHO compliant trial information disclosure: 30 July 2014)."
"25395414","White matter microstructural damage in small vessel disease is associated with Montreal cognitive assessment but not with mini mental state examination performances: vascular mild cognitive impairment Tuscany study.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has been proposed as a screening tool in vascular cognitive impairment. Diffusion tensor imaging is sensitive to white matter microstructural damage. We investigated if diffusion tensor imaging-derived indices are more strongly associated with performances on MoCA or on the widely used mini mental state examination in patients with mild cognitive impairment and small vessel disease.METHODS: Mild cognitive impairment patients with moderate/severe degrees of white matter hyperintensities on MRI were enrolled. Lacunar infarcts, cortical atrophy, medial temporal lobe atrophy and median values of mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy of the cerebral white matter were studied and correlated with cognitive tests performances.RESULTS: Seventy-six patients (mean age 75.1±6.8 years, mean years of education 8.0±4.3) were assessed. In univariate analyses, a significant association of both MoCA and mini mental state examination scores with age, education, cortical atrophy, and medial temporal lobe atrophy was found, whereas mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy were associated with MoCA. In partial correlation analyses, adjusting for all demographic and neuroimaging variables, both mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy were associated only with MoCA (mean diffusivity: r= -0.275, P=0.023; fractional anisotropy: r=0.246, P=0.043).CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mild cognitive impairment and small vessel disease, diffusion tensor imaging-measured white matter microstructural damage is more related to MoCA than mini mental state examination performances. MoCA is suited for the cognitive screening of patients with small vessel disease."
"25392099","Mini mental state exam versus Montreal cognitive assessment in patients with age-related macular degeneration.","OBJECTIVE: To compare the ability of the MMSE and MoCA to identify cognitive dysfunction in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 81 (29 female, 52 male) AMD patients who were recruited from the Ophthalmology Department of Kirikkale University during 2012. Participants were screened for cognitive impairment using the MMSE and MoCA. The scores were recorded for all participants. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with a score less than 21 on either test.RESULTS: The percentage of subjects who scored below a cut off of 21/30 was higher on the MoCA (48.1%) than on the MMSE (18.5%) (p = 0.05). The range and standard deviation of scores was larger with the MoCA (7-30, 5.34) than with the MMSE (19-30, 3.26). There was a more pronounced ceiling effect of the MMSE than of the MoCA. The mean MMSE scores of dry-and wet-type AMD patients was significantly higher than the MoCA scores of the same patients (p = 0.000 and p = 0.000).CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA seems to be more sensitive than the MMSE to early cognitive impairment in AMD patients."

Diabetes is associated with cognitive impairment in older people. However, the link between elevated GA/HbA1c levels and the risk of cognitive impairment in nondiabetic individuals is unclear.METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 474 old, nondiabetic adults (192 women, mean age 73.8 years ± 6.9 SD) who had been admitted to our hospital was conducted. Glycemic measures included fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour post-prandial plasmic glucose (2hPPG), GA and HbA1c. Cognitive function was assessed using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at the same examination visit in which the glycemic measures were determined.RESULTS: When the individuals were divided into two groups according to the median of GA/HbA1c ratio, old adults with GA/HbA1c ratio = 2.53 showed lower MMSE and MoCA scores compared to those with GA/HbA1c ratio<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>2.53. Univariate regression analysis showed that MMSE and MoCA scores were not correlated with HbA1c, but were inversely correlated with GA and GA/HbA1c ratio. Linear regression analysis revealed that there was a significant negative correlation between GA/HbA1c and cognitive function (ß = -0.77, P &lt; 0.01 for MoCA and ß = -0.69, P &lt; 0.05 for MMSE) even after adjustment for age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, lipoprotein(a) and sex.CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that even in the absence of manifest type 2 diabetes mellitus, GA/HbA1c ratio levels exert a negative influence on cognition and it may be a better predictor for cognitive impairment in the older population."
"25380622","Normative data for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in an Italian population sample.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a rapid screening battery, also including subtests to assess frontal functions such as set-shifting, abstraction and cognitive flexibility. MoCA seems to be useful to identify non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and subcortical dementia; it has high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing MCI from mild Alzheimer's Disease. Previous studies revealed that certain items of MoCA may be culturally biased and highlighted the need for population-based norms for the MoCA. The aim of present study was to collect normative values in a sample of Italian healthy subjects. Four hundred and fifteen Italian healthy subjects (252 women and 163 men) of different ages (age range 21-95 years) and educational level (from primary to university) underwent MoCA and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that age and education significantly influenced performance on MoCA. No significant effect of gender was found. From the derived linear equation, a correction grid for MoCA raw scores was built. Inferential cut-off score, estimated using a non-parametric technique, is 15.5 and equivalent scores were computed. Correlation analysis showed a significant but weak correlation between MoCA adjusted scores with MMSE adjusted scores (r = 0.43, p &lt; 0.001). The present study provided normative data for the MoCA in an Italian population useful for both clinical and research purposes."
"25379411","Arterial spin labelling reveals prolonged arterial arrival time in idiopathic Parkinson's disease.","Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, yet effective disease modifying treatments are still lacking. Neurodegeneration involves multiple interacting pathological pathways. The extent to which neurovascular mechanisms are involved is not well defined in IPD. We aimed to determine whether novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, including arterial spin labelling (ASL) quantification of cerebral perfusion, can reveal altered neurovascular status (NVS) in IPD. Fourteen participants with IPD (mean ± SD age 65.1 ± 5.9 years) and 14 age and cardiovascular risk factor matched control participants (mean ± SD age 64.6 ± 4.2 years) underwent a 3T MRI scan protocol. ASL images were collected before, during and after a 6 minute hypercapnic challenge. FLAIR images were used to determine white matter lesion score. Quantitative images of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and arterial arrival time (AAT) were calculated from the ASL data both at rest and during hypercapnia. Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) images were calculated, depicting the change in CBF and AAT relative to the change in end-tidal CO2. A significant (p = 0.005) increase in whole brain averaged baseline AAT was observed in IPD participants (mean ± SD age 1532 ± 138 ms) compared to controls (mean ± SD age 1335 ± 165 ms). Voxel-wise analysis revealed this to be widespread across the brain. However, there were no statistically significant differences in white matter lesion score, CBF, or CVR between patients and controls. Regional CBF, but not AAT, in the IPD group was found to correlate positively with Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scores. These findings provide further evidence of alterations in NVS in IPD."
"25375275","Neurocognitive changes after lung transplantation.","RATIONALE: Neurocognitive impairments are associated with reduced quality of life and may adversely affect medical compliance, but their prevalence after lung transplantation has not been extensively studied.OBJECTIVES: To examine the frequency of neurocognitive impairment after lung transplantation and to examine perioperative factors affecting post-transplant neurocognitive function.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We performed serial assessments of neurocognitive function in a consecutive series of 47 subjects who received transplants between March 2013 and November 2013 (45% women; mean age, 53.5<U+2009>±<U+2009>17.2 yr). Neurocognitive function was assessed using a composite measure including the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) total score and Trail Making Test parts A and B obtained before transplant, at hospital discharge, and 3 months after discharge. The presence of neurocognitive impairment was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Battery (MoCA), and in-hospital delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method. Results demonstrated that neurocognitive performance initially worsened among non-cystic fibrosis patients and improved over follow-up (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.002). Time effects were strongest on Trail Making Test part B (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) and the RBANS (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.054). Participants who exhibited delirium during their hospitalization showed poorer performance during follow-up assessments (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.006). Examination of cognitive impairment rates demonstrated that 21 participants (45%) exhibited neurocognitive impairment (MoCA<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>26) before lung transplant, whereas 27 (57%) participants exhibited impairment after transplantation, and 19 (57%) participants continued to neurocognitive impairment during a 3-month follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: Neurocognitive impairments are prevalent among lung transplant candidates and appear to worsen in some patients after transplant. Delirium during hospitalization is associated with worse neurocognitive function after transplant among patients without cystic fibrosis."

"25360018","Measuring cognition: the Chicago Cognitive Function Measure in the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project, Wave 2.","OBJECTIVES: To describe the development of a multidimensional test of cognition for the National Social life, Health and Aging Project (NSHAP), the Chicago Cognitive Function Measure (CCFM).METHOD: CCFM development included 3 steps: (a) A pilot test of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to create a standard protocol, choose specific items, reorder items, and improve clarity; (b) integration into a CAPI-based format; and (c) evaluation of the performance of the CCFM in the field. The CCFM was subsequently incorporated into NSHAP, Wave 2 (n = 3,377).RESULTS: The pre-test (n = 120) mean age was 71.35 (SD 8.40); 53% were female, 69% white, and 70% with college or greater education. The MoCA took an average of 15.6min; the time for the CCFM was 12.0 min. CCFM scores (0-20) can be used as a continuous outcome or to adjust for cognition in a multivariable analysis. CCFM scores were highly correlated with MoCA scores (r = .973). Modeling projects MoCA scores from CCFM scores using the equation: MoCA = (1.14 × CCFM) + 6.83. In Wave 2, the overall weighted mean CCFM score was 13.9 (SE 0.13).DISCUSSION: A survey-based adaptation of the MoCA was successfully integrated into a nationally representative sample of older adults, NSHAP Wave 2."
"25347578","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) - a sensitive screening instrument for detecting cognitive impairment in chronic hemodialysis patients.","BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) therapy have an increased risk of developing cognitive impairment and dementia, which are known relevant factors in disease prognosis and therapeutic success, but still lack adequate screening in clinical routine. We evaluated the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) for suitability in assessing cognitive performance in HD patients in comparison to the commonly used Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and a detailed neuropsychological test battery, used as gold standard.METHODS: 43 HD patients and 42 healthy controls with an average age of 58 years, were assessed with the MoCA, the MMSE and a detailed neuropsychological test battery, covering the domains of memory, attention, language, visuospatial and executive functions. Composite scores were created for comparison of cognitive domains and test results were analyzed using Spearman's correlation and linear regression. Cognitive dysfunction was defined using z-score values and predictive values were calculated. Sensitivity and specificity of the MoCA were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.RESULTS: HD patients performed worse in all cognitive domains, especially in memory recall and executive functions. The MoCA correlated well with the detailed test battery and identified patients with cognitive impairment with a sensitivity of 76.7% and specificity of 78.6% for a cut-off value of =24 out of 30 points. In the detailed assessment executive functions accounted significantly for performance in the MoCA. The MMSE only discriminated weakly between groups.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA represents a suitable cognitive screening tool for hemodialysis patients, demonstrating good sensitivity and specificity levels, and covering executive functions, which appear to play an important role in cognitive performance of HD patients."
"25325767","Effects of hearing and vision impairments on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment.","Many standardized measures of cognition include items that must be seen or heard. Nevertheless, it is not uncommon to overlook the possible effects of sensory impairment(s) on test scores. In the current study, we investigated whether sensory impairments could affect performance on a widely used screening tool, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Three hundred and one older adults (mean age = 71 years) completed the MoCA and also hearing and vision tests. Half of the participants had normal hearing and vision, 38% impaired hearing, 5% impaired vision, and 7% had dual-sensory impairment. More participants with normal sensory acuity passed the MoCA compared to those with sensory loss, even after modifying scores to adjust for sensory factors. The results suggest that cognitive abilities may be underestimated if sensory problems are not considered and that people with sensory loss are at greater risk of cognitive decline."
"25323981","Kidney disease and cognitive function: African American-diabetes heart study MIND.","AIMS: Albuminuria and reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are linked with poorer cognitive performance in European-ancestry populations with advanced nephropathy; relationships in African Americans (AAs) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are less clear. Tests of cognitive performance, urine albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR), and CKD-EPI eGFR were performed in unrelated AAs with T2D to determine relationships.METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of 263 unrelated AAs with T2D recruited in the African American-Diabetes Heart Study (AA-DHS) MIND. Global cognitive function (mini-mental state exam [3MSE] and Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]), memory (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test [RAVLT]), executive function (Stroop, verbal fluency for animals, and Digit Symbol Copy [DSC]), UACR, and eGFR were determined. Relationships between cognitive tests and renal parameters were assessed using multivariate models, adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, hemoglobin A1c, level of education, hypertension, and LDL cholesterol.RESULTS: Participants had a mean ± SD age of 60.2 ± 9.7 years, 62.7% were female, T2D duration was 14.3 ± 8.9 years, eGFR 86.0 ± 23.2 ml/min/1.73 m(2), and UACR 155.8 ± 542.1 (median 8.1) mg/g. In adjusted models, higher UACR was associated with worse 3MSE (p = 0.014), MoCA (p = 0.0089), DSC (p = 0.0004), Stroop performance time (p = 0.003), Stroop errors (p = 0.032), and Stroop interference (p = 0.026). Higher eGFR was associated with better performance on DSC (p = 0.0071).CONCLUSIONS: In AAs with T2D, albuminuria and eGFR were associated with cognitive function, even in mild kidney disease. These data stress the need for interventions to prevent cognitive decline well before the late stages of kidney disease."
"25306507","Global cortical atrophy (GCA) associates with worse performance in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). A population-based study in community-dwelling elders living in rural Ecuador.","OBJECTIVE: Increasing numbers of individuals with cognitive impairment are posing economic threads to the developing world. Proper assessment of this condition may be complicated by illiteracy and cross-cultural factors. We conducted a population-based study in elders living in rural Ecuador to evaluate whether the MoCA associated with structural brain damage in less-educated populations.METHODS: Atahualpa residents aged =60 years were identified during a door-to-door survey and invited to undergo MRI for grading GCA. Using a multivariate generalized linear model, we evaluated whether MoCA scores correlates with GCA, after adjusting for demographics, education, cardiovascular health (CVH) status, depression and edentulism.RESULTS: Out of 311 eligible persons, 241 (78%) were enrolled. Mean age was 69.2±7.5 years, 141 (59%) were women, 199 (83%) had primary school education, 175 (73%) had poor CVH status, 30 (12%) had symptoms of depression and 104 (43%) had edentulism. Average MoCA scores were 18.5±4.7 points. GCA was mild in 108, moderate in 95, and severe in 26 persons. Total and most domain-specific MoCA scores were significantly worse in persons with moderate to severe GCA. In the multivariate model, mean MoCA score was associated with GCA severity (ß=2.38, SE=1.07, p=0.027).CONCLUSIONS: MoCA scores associate with severity of GCA after adjusting for potential confounders, and may be used as reliable estimates of structural brain damage. However, a lower cut-off than that recommended for developed countries, would be better for recognizing cognitive impairment in less educated populations."

"25292386","The Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Screen: a cross-sectional comparison of established screening tools in a German-Swiss population.","The Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen (ECAS) has recently been developed as a fast and easy cognitive screening tool specifically designed for patients with motor impairments in routine clinical use. The German/Swiss-German version of the ECAS was validated in a German-Swiss consortium. One hundred and thirty-six non-demented ALS patients and 160 healthy controls were included in the study. In addition, the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease plus Scale (CERAD plus) were administered to subgroups of patients. Results showed that administration of ECAS was fast (mean 24 min). Similar to the population in the UK version, ALS patients performed significantly worse in the ALS-specific functions (p &lt; 0.001), specifically in the domain of language (p &lt; 0.001), verbal fluency (p = 0.005) and executive functions (p = 0.02), but not for the non-ALS-specific functions. Carers reported behavioural abnormalities in about 30% and psychotic symptoms in 6% of the patients. Compared to ECAS, FAB, MoCA and CERAD were more generic and performance was not adjusted to motor speed. We conclude that the German/Swiss-German version of the ECAS is a fast and easy to administer cognitive screening instrument sensitive for ALS-specific dysfunctions and behaviour change. "
"25272033","Spontaneous brain activity in type 2 diabetics revealed by amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations and its association with diabetic vascular disease: a resting-state FMRI study.","PURPOSE: To investigate correlations between altered spontaneous brain activity, diabetic vascular disease, and cognitive function for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI).METHODS: Rs-fMRI was performed for T2DM patients (n = 26) and age-, gender-, and education-matched non-diabetic control subjects (n = 26). Amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) were computed from fMRI signals to measure spontaneous neuronal activity. Differences in the ALFF patterns between patients and controls, as well as their correlations with clinical variables, were evaluated.RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, T2DM patients exhibited significantly decreased ALFF values mainly in the frontal and parietal lobes, the bilateral thalumi, the posterior lobe of the cerebellum, and increased ALFF values mainly in the visual cortices. Furthermore, lower ALFF values in the left subcallosal gyrus correlated with lower ankle-brachial index values (r = 0.481, p = 0.020), while lower ALFF values in the bilateral medial prefrontal gyri correlated with higher urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (r =<U+200A> -0.418, p = 0.047). In addition, most of the regions with increased ALFF values in the visual cortices were found to negatively correlate with MoCA scores.CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that ALFF are altered in many brain regions in T2DM patients, and this is associated with the presence of diabetic vascular disease and poor cognitive performance. These findings may provide additional insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms that mediate T2DM-related cognitive dysfunction, and may also serve as a reference for future research."
"25249353","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is superior to the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) in detection of Korsakoff's syndrome.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) are brief screening instruments for cognitive disorders. Although these instruments have frequently been used in the detection of dementia, there is currently little knowledge on the validity to detect Korsakoff's syndrome (KS) with both screening instruments. KS is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder associated with profound declarative amnesia after thiamine deficiency. A representative sample of 30 patients with KS and 30 age-, education-, gender- and premorbid-IQ-matched controls was administered the MoCA and MMSE. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated in addition to the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for various cut-off points on the MoCA and MMSE. Compared with the MMSE, the MoCA demonstrated consistently superior psychometric properties and discriminant validity--AUC: MoCA (1.00 SE .003) and MMSE (0.92 SE .033). When applying a cut-off value as suggested in the manuals of both instruments, the MMSE (&lt; 24) misdiagnosed 46.7% of the patients, while the MoCA (&lt; 26) diagnosed all patients correctly. As a screening instrument with the most optimal cut-offs, the MoCA (optimal cutoff point 22/23, 98.3% correctly diagnosed) was superior to the MMSE (optimal cutoff point 26/27, 83.3% correctly diagnosed). We conclude that both tests have adequate psychometric properties as a screening instrument for the detection of KS, but the MoCA is superior to the MMSE for this specific patient population."
"25248911","Validation of the Montreal cognitive assessment versus mini-mental state examination against hypertension and hypertensive arteriopathy after transient ischemic attack or minor stroke.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Lack of reduced cognitive impairment with blood pressure (BP) lowering in trials may reflect use of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), which is insensitive to mild cognitive impairment after cerebrovascular events compared with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. We determined relationships between impairment on MMSE versus Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) with the major physiological determinant of vascular cognitive impairment: hypertension and hypertensive arteriopathy.METHODS: Cognitive impairment in consecutive patients 6 months after transient ischemic attack or minor stroke was defined as significant, mild, or none (MMSE&lt;23, 23-26, =27; MoCA&lt;20, 20-24, =25) and related to 20 premorbid systolic BP readings, home BP measurement (3 measurements, 3×daily for 1 month), and hypertensive arteriopathy (creatinine, stroke versus transient ischemic attack, leukoaraiosis) by ordinal regression.RESULTS: Of 463 patients, 45% versus 28% had at least mild cognitive impairment on the MoCA versus MMSE (P&lt;0.001). Hypertensive arteriopathy was more strongly associated with cognitive impairment on the MoCA than MMSE (creatinine: odds ratio=3.99; 95% confidence interval, 2.06-7.73 versus 2.16, 1.08-4.33; event: 1.53, 1.06-2.19 versus 1.23, 0.81-1.85; leukoaraiosis: 2.09, 1.42-3.06 versus 1.34, 0.87-2.07). Premorbid and home BP measurement systolic BP were more strongly associated with impairment on vascular subdomains of the MoCA than MMSE (odds ratio/10 mm Hg: visuospatial 1.29 versus 1.05; attention 1.18 versus 1.07; language 1.22 versus 0.91; naming 1.07 versus 0.86).CONCLUSIONS: The stronger relationship between impairment on the MoCA with hypertensive arteriopathy, independent of age, indicates a greater sensitivity for vascular-origin cognitive impairment. Use of MoCA should improve sensitivity for cognitive impairment and treatment effects in future studies."

The oral examination measured indices of oral health status: number of present teeth, number of functional teeth, occlusal force and amount of resting saliva. Multiple logistic regression analyses were carried out to determine the factors associated with poor self-rated oral health.RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 73.5<U+2009>±<U+2009>5.0<U+2009>years. The prevalence of poor and rather poor self-rated oral health was 11.5% and 29.5%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that the number of present teeth (odds ratio [OR] 0.97, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.95-0.99), difficulty in mastication (OR 3.20, CI 2.18-4.70), presence of xerostomia (OR 1.43, CI 1.02-2.01), total score on the MoCA-J (OR 1.06, CI 1.01-1.11), and reduction in frequency of leaving the house (OR 1.64, CI 1.12-2.41) were significantly associated with poor self-rated oral health.CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggested that self-rated oral health was a significant factor in oral health status as well as overall well-being among community-dwelling older Japanese people."

In addition, the difference in cognitive decline of age-matched late elderly normal subjects and DM patients was investigated.RESULTS: The present study revealed that cognitive and affective functions declined in some DM patients. Furthermore, the decline in these functions was unrelated to fasting blood sugar level but was related to glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and insulin resistance. Poor HbA1c control was associated with a significant decline in the 'calculation' subscale and insulin resistance for 'naming', 'read list of letters' and 'delayed recall' Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) subscale scores. Magnetic resonance imaging scans showed that both periventricular hyperintensity (PVH) and deep white matter hyperintensity were associated with Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and MoCA scores, but only PVH was related to homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance scores. Compared with age-matched late elderly normal subjects, 'orientation to time' and 'registration' MMSE subscales declined in late elderly DM patients.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that cognitive and affective decline in DM patients was mostly related to glucose control and insulin resistance, whilst amongst late elderly subjects the impairment of 'attention' and 'orientation' were characteristic features of DM patients."
"25176439","Montreal Cognitive Assessment for the screening and prediction of cognitive decline in early Parkinson's disease.","BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of cognitive impairment in PD would allow appropriate monitoring and timely intervention to reduce the progression to dementia (PDD).OBJECTIVE: To study the usefulness of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in the screening for mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and its predictive utility in determining longitudinal cognitive decline in PD.METHODS: Prospective longitudinal study of patients with mild PD. PD-MCI and PDD was diagnosed based on the Movement Disorder taskforce (MDS) criteria. Receiver Operating Characteristic analyses and Cox regression analyses were performed.RESULTS: 95 patients; mean age 66.37 (SD 7.86); mean H&amp;Y score of 1.99 (SD 0.45) were studied. At baseline, 34 patients fulfilled the MDS criteria for PD-MCI. MoCA, compared to the MMSE had a high discriminatory power in detecting PD-MCI [Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.912, p &lt; 0.001]. A MoCA score of =26 provided a sensitivity of 93.1% for the diagnosis of PD-MCI. In the longitudinal cohort over 2 years, baseline MOCA was useful in predicting cognitive decline (AUC of 0.707, p = 0.05). With Cox regression analyses, a 1-point lower score on baseline MoCA was associated with a 34% increased risk of cognitive decline [Hazard ratio (HR) 1.34; 95% CI: 1.03-1.74: p = 0.029]. A baseline MoCA =26 was highly predictive of progressive cognitive decline (HR 3.47, 95% CI: 2.38-5.07; p &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: MoCA is a reliable tool in predicting cognitive decline in early PD. A MoCA score of =26 significantly increases the risk for progressive cognitive decline."
"25155360","Influence of depression, anxiety and stress on cognitive performance in community-dwelling older adults living in rural Ecuador: results of the Atahualpa Project.","AIM: To assess the relationship between cognitive status and self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress of older adults living in an underserved rural South American population.METHODS: Community-dwelling Atahualpa residents aged =60<U+2009>years were identified during a door-to-door census, and evaluated with the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). We explored whether positivity in each of the DASS-21 axes was related to total and domain-specific MoCA performance after adjustment for age, sex and education.RESULTS: A total of 280 persons (59% women; mean age, mean age 70<U+2009>±<U+2009>8<U+2009>years) were included. Based on established cut-offs for the DASS-21, 12% persons had depression, 15% had anxiety and 5% had stress. Mean total MoCA scores were significantly lower for depressed than for not depressed individuals (15.9<U+2009>±<U+2009>5.5 vs 18.9<U+2009>±<U+2009>4.4, P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.0001). Depressed participants had significantly lower total and domain-specific MoCA scores for abstraction, short-term memory and orientation. Anxiety was related to significantly lower total MoCA scores (17<U+2009>±<U+2009>4.7 vs 18.8<U+2009>±<U+2009>4.5, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02), but not to differences in domain-specific MoCA scores. Stress was not associated with significant differences in MoCA scores.CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that depression and anxiety are associated with poorer cognitive performance in elderly residents living in rural areas of developing countries."
"25147113","Optimal cutoff scores for dementia and mild cognitive impairment of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment among elderly and oldest-old Chinese population.","BACKGROUND: All versions of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) lack population-based data of 80-plus individuals. The norms and cut-off scores for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia of the MoCA are different among five Chinese versions.OBJECTIVE: To provide the cut-off scores in detecting MCI and dementia of the Peking Medical Union College Hospital version of the MoCA (MoCA-P).METHODS: In a cross-sectional survey, Chinese veterans aged =60 years completed the MoCA-P and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).RESULTS: Among 7,445 elderly veterans, 5,085 (68.30%) were aged =80 years old, 2,621 (35.20%) had 6 years of education or less, 6,847 (91.97%) were male, and 2,311 (31.04%) and 984 (13.22%) veterans were diagnosed as having MCI and dementia, respectively. Adding two points and one point to the MoCA scores for the primary and middle school groups, respectively, can fully adjust for the notable impact of education but cannot compensate for the effect of age. In the three age groups (60-79, 80-89, and =90 years old), the optimal MoCA-P cut-off scores for detecting MCI were =25, =24, and =23, respectively, and for detecting dementia were =24, =21, and =19, respectively, which demonstrated relatively high sensitivities and specificities. The areas under the curves for the MoCA-P for detecting MCI and dementia (0.937 and 0.908, respectively) were greater than those for the MMSE (0.848 and 0.892, respectively).CONCLUSION: Compared with the MMSE, the MoCA-P is significantly better for detecting MCI in the elderly, particularly in the oldest old population, and it also displays more effectiveness in detecting dementia."
"25139107","Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)-Italian version: regression based norms and equivalent scores.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a brief cognitive screening instrument developed by Nasreddine et al. to detect mild cognitive impairment, a high-risk condition for Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. In this study we report normative data on the MoCA-Italian version, collected on a sample of 225 Italian healthy subjects ranged in age between 60 and 80 years, and in formal education from 5 to 23 years. The global normal cognition was established in accordance with the Mini-Mental State Examination score and with the Prose Memory Test score (Spinnler and Tognoni, Ital J Neurol Sci 6:25-27, 1987). None of the participants had a history of psychiatric, neurological, cerebrovascular disorders or brain injury or took drugs affecting cognition. Linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the potential effect of age, education and sex on the MoCA total performance score. We provide correction grids to adjust raw scores and equivalent scores with cut-off value to allow comparison between MoCA performance and others neuropsychological test scores that can be administered on the same subject."
"25128866","The prevalence of cognitive impairment in emergency general surgery.","OBJECTIVES: Rates of all surgical procedures are increasing at a faster rate than the population is ageing. However, this encouraging statistic, necessitates a robust evidence base. The epidemiological evidence base in acute general surgery in the older person is sparse. This is the first assessment of the prevalence of cognitive impairment measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment tool (MoCA) in acute general surgery.METHODS: In three sites in Wales, England and Scotland comprising rural and urban populations, we studied consecutive patients aged over 65 years. We considered any older person admitted to the acute general surgical unit. We assessed them for baseline demographic data. They each underwent a MoCA assessment.RESULTS: We collected data on 245 people, mean age 76.9 years (8.1, standard deviation), 136 (55.5%) were women. Of these 201 completed the MoCA test, mean score of 18.9 and median score 20 (range 0-30). There were 37 (15.1%) MoCA scores in the normal range (=26) and 44 (18%) people were unable to attempt (or complete) the MoCA. Increasing age (p &lt; 0.01) but not sex (p = 0.14) predicted an abnormal MoCA. Considering only the 44 people who were unable to attempt the MoCA assessment, 11 (25%) were known to have a diagnosis of dementia, 9 (20.5%) were too unwell and the remainder unable to complete the assessment to due pre-existing disability.CONCLUSIONS: In a representative UK wide population, a high proportion of older people admitted with an acute general surgical problem had cognitive impairment when assessed using the MoCA."
"25126077","A new clinical tool for assessing numerical abilities in neurological diseases: numerical activities of daily living.","The aim of this study was to build an instrument, the numerical activities of daily living (NADL), designed to identify the specific impairments in numerical functions that may cause problems in everyday life. These impairments go beyond what can be inferred from the available scales evaluating activities of daily living in general, and are not adequately captured by measures of the general deterioration of cognitive functions as assessed by standard clinical instruments like the MMSE and MoCA. We assessed a control group (n = 148) and a patient group affected by a wide variety of neurological conditions (n = 175), with NADL along with IADL, MMSE, and MoCA. The NADL battery was found to have satisfactory construct validity and reliability, across a wide age range. This enabled us to calculate appropriate criteria for impairment that took into account age and education. It was found that neurological patients tended to overestimate their abilities as compared to the judgment made by their caregivers, assessed with objective tests of numerical abilities. "
"25105909","Serum CRP and urinary trypsin inhibitor implicate postoperative cognitive dysfunction especially in elderly patients.","PURPOSE: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) characterized as the decline of memory and executive function after major surgery is not well illustrated. The aim of this study is to discover whether inflammatory cytokines and urinary trypsin inhibitor (uTi) contribute to the development of POCD.METHOD: Sixty-three patients undergoing lumber discectomy and 47 age-matched control volunteers were involved in this study. The level of C-reaction protein (CRP) and uTi/urine creatinine (Ucr) was measured by immunoturbidimetry and enzyme-inhibition assay, respectively. Meanwhile, ELISA was involved to detect the level of IL-6, IL-10, MMP-9 in serum. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test was used to determine the cognitive decline of the patients and age-matched controls.RESULT: In POCD group, the level of IL-6, IL-10, CRP, MMP-9 in serum and uTi /Ucr in urine was significantly higher than that in the group without POCD. The POCD was more frequently observed in elderly group than in the middle-aged group (43.75% versus 19.35%, p = 0.038). After logistic regression analysis adjusted by the age, only serum CRP at 72 h postoperation and urinary uTi /Ucr at 24 h postoperation were the independent risk factors of POCD.CONCLUSION: Age-related increasing proinflammatory postoperation may result in higher occurrence of POCD in the elderly. Additionally, patients with extremely high concentrations of CRP in serum at 72 h postoperation and uTi /Ucr in urine at 24 h postoperation are more likely to experience POCD, especially in the elderly."
"25097514","Blood pressure levels and prognosis of intracranial trauma patients with cognitive dysfunction.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of blood pressure levels on prognosis of intracranial trauma patients with cognitive dysfunction.METHODS: One hundred and twenty intracranial trauma patients enrolled in our hospital from February 2011 to July 2013 were selected, including 40 hypertension and 80 non-hypertension cases. They were investigated by MiniMental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scales, and the clinical data were retrospectively analyzed.RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the MoCA, visuospatial executive function, attention, language, delayed recall, MMSE, orientation and memory scores of the hypertension group were significantly lower. Unconditional Logistic regression analysis showed that age, history of cerebrovascular disease and triglyceride level were the independent risk factors of cognitive function.CONCLUSION: The blood pressure levels of intracranial trauma patients were associated with cognitive function, with age, history of cerebrovascular disease and triglyceride level as the independent risk factors. Therefore, it is necessary to control blood pressure level to improve prognosis."
"25088285","Cognitive functioning in complicated grief.","Complicated grief (CG) is increasingly recognized as a debilitating outcome of bereavement. Given the intensity of the stressor, its chronicity, and its association with depression, it is important to know the impact CG may have on cognitive functioning. This exploratory and descriptive study examined global and domain-specific cognitive functioning in a help-seeking sample of individuals with CG (n = 335) compared to a separately ascertained control sample (n = 250). Cognitive functioning was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Controlling for age, sex and education effects, CG participants had lower total MoCA, visuospatial and attention scores relative to control participants. The two groups did not differ significantly in the domains of executive function, language, memory or orientation. Age, sex, and education accounted for much of the variance in MoCA scores, while CG severity and chronicity accounted for a very small percentage of MoCA score variance. Major depression was not a significant predictor of MoCA scores. This study is consistent with previous work demonstrating lower attention and global cognitive performance in individuals with CG compared to control participants. This study newly identifies the visuospatial domain as a target for future studies investigating cognitive functioning in CG."
"25061047","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment in cognitively-intact elderly: a case for age-adjusted cutoffs.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a widely used screening test for evaluation of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), with a single cutoff for all ages. We examined whether it is associated with age in a sample of cognitively-intact elderly (CIE). The average MoCA score was negatively correlated with age and was significantly higher for younger than older CIE. Additionally, 42% of the older elderly fell below the proposed MCI cutoff score, although all subjects were CIE. Thus, cognitive abilities captured by the MoCA test decrease with age, even in CIE. Therefore, cutoff scores by age for the MoCA are needed. "
"25040216","Feasibility of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in acute stroke patients.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cognitive deficits are common following stroke. Cognitive function in the acute stroke setting is a predictive factor for mid-term outcome. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a screening tool for cognitive impairment. The feasibility of MoCA in the acute phase of stroke was evaluated and factors predictive of cognitive impairment were determined.METHODS: In this prospective, single-centre, explorative and observational study consecutive patients with ischaemic (IS) or haemorrhagic (ICH) stroke were enrolled between March 2011 and September 2012. The routine work-up for each patient encompassed assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the pre-morbid modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Cognitive performance was measured using the German version of the MoCA within the first days of admission. A MoCA score of &lt;26 was considered to indicate cognitive impairment.RESULTS: Between March 2011 and September 2012 a total of 842 patients with IS (89.0%) and ICH (11.0%) were enrolled in our study. MoCA was feasible in 678/842 patients (80.5%). Factors independently associated with non-feasibility were stroke severity (NIHSS), pre-morbid functional status (mRS), age and lower educational level. Mean MoCA was 21.4 (SD 5.7). A total of 498/678 (73.5%) patients appeared cognitively impaired (&lt;26/30). Independent predictive factors for a lower MoCA score were age, educational level, stroke severity (NIHSS) and pre-morbid functional status (mRS).CONCLUSIONS: In the acute phase of stroke, MoCA is feasible in about 80% of eligible patients. At this stage, MoCA identifies a cognitive impairment in 75% of patients."
"25023857","Cognitive screening for dementia in primary care: a systematic review.","BACKGROUND: Identifying dementia in primary care could minimize the impact of a late intervention; however, it shows high rates of misdiagnosis. One of the reasons seems to be the lack of knowledge of adequate cognitive screening instruments. This is a systematic review of the available instruments for the primary care context.METHOD: For this systematic review, articles were collected according to the following combined key terms: &quot;cognitive screening&quot; and &quot;dementia&quot; and &quot;primary care&quot; and &quot;review&quot;. Studies should be reviews focusing on cognitive screening instruments best used in primary care setting.RESULTS: Thirteen reviews were selected. In total, it was considered 34 cognitive screening instruments. Half of the instruments can be applied in an adequate time-limit for primary care context. Memory is the most commonly assessed cognitive function (91%). Almost half of the tests are mentioned to have influence of education or cultural factors (44%).CONCLUSION: Tests such as 6CIT, AMT, GPCOG, Mini-Cog, MIS, MoCA, and STMS seem to be good alternatives to the use of the Mini-Mental State Examination when considering factors such as application time, sensitivity, specificity, and number of studies. However, there is a wide range of tests with different characteristics, therefore it is recommended that the professional gets some expertise in a few number of instruments in order to be able to choose which to use, or use in combination, depending on the setting and the profile of the patient."
"25017513","The prevalence and impact of undiagnosed cognitive impairment in older vascular surgical patients.","OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this observational cohort study were to investigate the prevalence of undiagnosed cognitive impairment in older patients presenting for vascular surgery, to examine its association with adverse postoperative outcomes, and to test the feasibility of a preoperative cognitive assessment tool.METHODS: Patients aged 60 years or older were recruited by consent on admission to the vascular surgical ward of an inner-city teaching hospital with a large tertiary referral practice for proposed elective or emergency aortic or lower limb arterial intervention. Cognition was assessed preoperatively by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and a score below 24/30 indicated cognitive impairment or dementia. The mean length of time taken to complete the assessment was recorded. Baseline characteristics (medical multimorbidity, frailty, and laboratory tests), hospital length of stay (LOS), and postoperative complications were documented.RESULTS: Preoperative MoCA was completed in 114 patients with a mean age of 76.3 years (standard deviation, 7.36 years); 67.5% were men, and 55.3% of procedures were elective. The MoCA was completed in 100% of patients and was quick and acceptable to patients in this setting. Cognitive impairment or dementia was found in 68% of patients (77 of 114) and was previously unrecognized in 88.3% of patients (68 of 77). Therefore, 60.5% of patients (68 of 114) aged 60 years or older presenting for vascular surgery had previously undiagnosed cognitive impairment. MoCA &lt;24 was univariately associated with pre-existing frailty (Edmonton Frail Scale [EFS] score =6.5) and longer LOS (=12 days). In logistic regression modeling, MoCA &lt;24 was strongly independently associated with frailty EFS score =6.5 (odds ratio, 12.55; P &lt; .001). By use of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), MoCA &lt;24 was predictive of longer LOS of =12 days (AUC, 0.621; P = .049). The strength of predictive power increased with the addition of frailty (EFS score =6.5) to the models (AUC, 0.695; P = .002).CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of cognitive impairment among older patients presenting for vascular surgery is high and frequently undiagnosed before admission. It is feasible to use the MoCA to identify cognitive impairment in this high-risk surgical group preoperatively. The combined assessment of frailty and cognition is predictive of adverse postoperative outcomes and longer LOS."
"24995445","The use of wide-scale mental agility testing to identify people at risk of dementia: crucial or harmful?","The prevalence of dementia in the UK is rising rapidly and is predicted to double over the next 30 years. The NHS in England has been told to push for a rapid rise in dementia diagnosis rates, so that by 2015, two out of three cases are identified. The Prime Minister has raised the 'dementia challenge' as a priority for the NHS. While there is agreement on the need for action, debate arises over the nature of that intervention. Some, including Professor Alessi, argue that tools exist to support the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and they should be used because the disease is amenable to interventions. He believes that we need a shift in knowledge and attitude from thresholds to a continuum of cognitive impairment, from late to early stages and from effects to causes. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCa) should become part of the routine NHS Health Check after people reach age 40. Dr Fox argues on the other hand that widespread testing could lead to unnecessary anxiety and panic among those at risk and that funding should be focused on learning more about the early stages of dementia. While the concept of early testing is appealing, there is a large knowledge gap; instruments in use have not been tested in pre-dementia patients and have limited validity. While there is debate over the approach, we can agree that the economic and social impacts of this condition need to be addressed sooner rather than later."
"24991170","Using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale to screen for dementia in Chinese patients with Parkinson's Disease.","BACKGROUND: Dementia is one of the most distressing and burdensome health problems associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale (MoCA) is widely used to screen for dementia in PD patients, but the appropriate diagnostic cutoff score when used with Chinese PD patients is not known.AIM: Determine a diagnostic cutoff value of the Chinese version of the MoCA (MoCA-C) for Chinese PD patients and describe the characteristics of PD patients screened positive for dementia using the MoCA-C.METHODS: The presence of dementia in 616 PD patients and 85 community controls was determined using the Movement Disorder Society Task Force criteria (the gold standard diagnosis). We administered the MoCA-C to these individuals and used a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to identify the cutoff score of the MoCA-C that most efficiently identified dementia in both PD patients and community controls. Demographic and clinical characteristics of PD patients who were screened positive or negative for dementia using the MoCA-C were compared.RESULTS: A MoCA-C score of 23 was the optimal cutoff score for dementia in both patients and controls. Using this cutoff score, the sensitivity and specificity of the MoCA-C in PD patients were 0.70 and 0.77, respectively; the positive and negative predictive values were 0.59 and 0.85, respectively; and the overall concordance (kappa [95% confidence interval]) was 0.45 (0.39-0.52). The corresponding kappa value (concordance) in community controls was only 0.25 (0.05-0.45). Compared to PD patients who screened negative for dementia, those who screened positive for dementia were significantly impaired in all cognitive domains, including visuospatial and executive functioning, naming, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall and orientation (all p&lt;0.001). Among the PD patients, screening positive for dementia was independently associated with old age, low educational attainment, female gender and more severe motor impairment.CONCLUSIONS: The commonly recommended cutoff screening score for dementia of 26 on the MoCA it too high for PD patients in China; a cutoff score of 23 is more appropriate. Potential risk factors for dementia in Chinese PD patients include older age, less education, and more severe motor symptoms of PD.MoCA-C 23<U+5206><U+662F><U+8BCA><U+65AD><U+5E15><U+91D1><U+68EE><U+6C0F><U+60A3><U+8005><U+53CA><U+5BF9><U+7167><U+7EC4><U+75F4><U+5446><U+7684><U+6700><U+4F73><U+5212><U+754C><U+5206><U+3002><U+4F7F><U+7528><U+8BE5><U+5212><U+754C><U+5206>,PD<U+60A3><U+8005><U+7684>MoCA-C<U+654F><U+611F><U+6027><U+548C><U+7279><U+5F02><U+6027><U+5206><U+522B><U+4E3A>0.70<U+548C>0.77,<U+9633><U+6027><U+548C><U+9634><U+6027><U+9884><U+6D4B><U+503C><U+5206><U+522B><U+4E3A>0.59<U+548C>0.85,<U+6574><U+4F53><U+4E00><U+81F4><U+6027>(kappa [95% <U+53EF><U+4FE1><U+533A><U+95F4>])<U+4E3A>0.45 (0.39-0.52)<U+3002><U+793E><U+533A><U+5BF9><U+7167><U+76F8><U+5E94><U+7684>kappa<U+503C> (<U+4E00><U+81F4><U+6027>)<U+4EC5><U+4E3A>0.25 (0.05-0.45)<U+3002><U+4E0E><U+7B5B><U+67E5><U+4E3A><U+75F4><U+5446><U+9634><U+6027><U+7684>PD<U+60A3><U+8005><U+76F8><U+6BD4>,<U+7B5B><U+67E5><U+4E3A><U+75F4><U+5446><U+9633><U+6027><U+7684>PD<U+60A3><U+8005><U+6240><U+6709><U+8BA4><U+77E5><U+529F><U+80FD><U+90FD><U+6709><U+663E><U+8457><U+53D7><U+635F>,<U+5305><U+62EC><U+89C6><U+89C9><U+7A7A><U+95F4><U+548C><U+6267><U+884C><U+529F><U+80FD>,<U+547D><U+540D>,<U+6CE8><U+610F><U+529B>,<U+8BED><U+8A00>,<U+62BD><U+8C61>,<U+5EF6><U+8FDF><U+56DE><U+5FC6><U+548C><U+5B9A><U+5411> (<U+5747>P&lt;0.001)<U+3002><U+5728><U+5E15><U+91D1><U+68EE><U+6C0F><U+75C7><U+60A3><U+8005><U+4E2D>,<U+7B5B><U+67E5><U+4E3A><U+75F4><U+5446><U+9633><U+6027><U+4E0E><U+5E74><U+8001>,<U+6587><U+5316><U+7A0B><U+5EA6><U+4F4E>,<U+5973><U+6027><U+4EE5><U+53CA><U+4E25><U+91CD><U+8FD0><U+52A8><U+969C><U+788D><U+72EC><U+7ACB><U+76F8><U+5173><U+3002></AbstractText>: MoCA-C 23<U+5206><U+662F><U+8BCA><U+65AD><U+5E15><U+91D1><U+68EE><U+6C0F><U+60A3><U+8005><U+53CA><U+5BF9><U+7167><U+7EC4><U+75F4><U+5446><U+7684><U+6700><U+4F73><U+5212><U+754C><U+5206><U+3002><U+4F7F><U+7528><U+8BE5><U+5212><U+754C><U+5206>,PD<U+60A3><U+8005><U+7684>MoCA-C<U+654F><U+611F><U+6027><U+548C><U+7279><U+5F02><U+6027><U+5206><U+522B><U+4E3A>0.70<U+548C>0.77,<U+9633><U+6027><U+548C><U+9634><U+6027><U+9884><U+6D4B><U+503C><U+5206><U+522B><U+4E3A>0.59<U+548C>0.85,<U+6574><U+4F53><U+4E00><U+81F4><U+6027>(kappa [95% <U+53EF><U+4FE1><U+533A><U+95F4>])<U+4E3A>0.45 (0.39-0.52)<U+3002><U+793E><U+533A><U+5BF9><U+7167><U+76F8><U+5E94><U+7684>kappa<U+503C> (<U+4E00><U+81F4><U+6027>)<U+4EC5><U+4E3A>0.25 (0.05-0.45)<U+3002><U+4E0E><U+7B5B><U+67E5><U+4E3A><U+75F4><U+5446><U+9634><U+6027><U+7684>PD<U+60A3><U+8005><U+76F8><U+6BD4>,<U+7B5B><U+67E5><U+4E3A><U+75F4><U+5446><U+9633><U+6027><U+7684>PD<U+60A3><U+8005><U+6240><U+6709><U+8BA4><U+77E5><U+529F><U+80FD><U+90FD><U+6709><U+663E><U+8457><U+53D7><U+635F>,<U+5305><U+62EC><U+89C6><U+89C9><U+7A7A><U+95F4><U+548C><U+6267><U+884C><U+529F><U+80FD>,<U+547D><U+540D>,<U+6CE8><U+610F><U+529B>,<U+8BED><U+8A00>,<U+62BD><U+8C61>,<U+5EF6><U+8FDF><U+56DE><U+5FC6><U+548C><U+5B9A><U+5411> (<U+5747>P&lt;0.001)<U+3002><U+5728><U+5E15><U+91D1><U+68EE><U+6C0F><U+75C7><U+60A3><U+8005><U+4E2D>,<U+7B5B><U+67E5><U+4E3A><U+75F4><U+5446><U+9633><U+6027><U+4E0E><U+5E74><U+8001>,<U+6587><U+5316><U+7A0B><U+5EA6><U+4F4E>,<U+5973><U+6027><U+4EE5><U+53CA><U+4E25><U+91CD><U+8FD0><U+52A8><U+969C><U+788D><U+72EC><U+7ACB><U+76F8><U+5173><U+3002>"
"24987404","Screening for impaired cognitive domains in a large Parkinson's disease population and its application to the diagnostic procedure for Parkinson's disease dementia.","BACKGROUND: Dementia is a new focus of research on improved treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). In 2007, a screening tool for PD dementia (PD-D) was developed by the Movement Disorder Society (Level I testing), which still requires verification by a large population study.METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional and multicenter study including 13 institutions administering the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to 304 PD patients (mean age: 70.6 ± 8.3 years; mean Hoehn and Yahr stage: 2.7 ± 0.7).RESULTS: In all, 34.5% of the patients had MMSE scores &lt;26; 94.3% of these patients had impairments in =2 cognitive domains and met the criteria for probable PD-D by Level I testing. Executive dysfunction combined with attention and memory impairment was most common (51.4%). In the Level I subtests of executive function, the score for phonemic fluency declined by &lt;50% in patients with high MoCA scores (24-30 points) and lacked specificity for PD-D. No patient had visuospatial impairment (measured by the pentagon copying subtest) alone, and the score for pentagon copying stayed at =70% even in patients with low MMSE scores (12-25 points), therefore lacking sensitivity for PD-D.CONCLUSIONS: Level I testing with administration of the MMSE and MoCA is a practical and efficient screening tool for PD-D. However, the phonemic fluency and pentagon copying tests should be replaced by more specific/sensitive ones when screening for PD-D."
"24982978","The influence of education on Chinese version of Montreal cognitive assessment in detecting amnesic mild cognitive impairment among older people in a Beijing rural community.","To assess the influence of education on the performance of Chinese version of Montreal cognitive assessment (C-MoCA) in relation to the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) in detecting amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) among rural-dwelling older people C-MoCA and MMSE was administered and diagnostic interviews were conducted among community-dwelling elderly in two villages in Beijing. The performance of C-MoCA and MMSE in detecting aMCI was evaluated by the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Effect size of education on variations in C-MoCA scores was estimated with general linear model. Among 172 study participants (24 cases of aMCI and 148 normal controls), the AUC of C-MoCA was 0.72 (95% CI = 0.62-0.81, cutoff = 20/21), compared to AUC of MMSE of 0.74 (95% CI = 0.64-0.84, cutoff = 26/27). The performance of both C-MoCA and MMSE was especially poorer among those with low (0-6 years) education. After controlling for gender and age, education ( <U+03B7>(2) = 0.204) had a surpassing effect over aMCI diagnosis ( <U+03B7>(2) = 0.052) on variations in C-MoCA scores. Among rural older people, the MoCA showed modest accuracy and was no better than MMSE in detecting aMCI, especially in those with low education, due to the overwhelming effect of education relative to aMCI diagnosis on variations in C-MoCA performance."
"24982631","Mesenchymal stem cells can modulate longitudinal changes in cortical thickness and its related cognitive decline in patients with multiple system atrophy.","Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an adult-onset, sporadic neurodegenerative disease. Because the prognosis of MSA is fatal, neuroprotective or regenerative strategies may be invaluable in MSA treatment. Previously, we obtained clinical and imaging evidence that mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) treatment could have a neuroprotective role in MSA patients. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of MSC therapy on longitudinal changes in subcortical deep gray matter volumes and cortical thickness and their association with cognitive performance. Clinical and imaging data were obtained from our previous randomized trial of autologous MSC in MSA patients. During 1-year follow-up, we assessed longitudinal differences in automatic segmentation-based subcortical deep gray matter volumes and vertex-wise cortical thickness between placebo (n = 15) and MSC groups (n = 11). Next, we performed correlation analysis between the changes in cortical thickness and changes in the Korean version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores and cognitive performance of each cognitive subdomain using a multiple, comparison correction. There were no significant differences in age at baseline, age at disease onset, gender ratio, disease duration, clinical severity, MoCA score, or education level between the groups. The automated subcortical volumetric analysis revealed that the changes in subcortical deep gray matter volumes of the caudate, putamen, and thalamus did not differ significantly between the groups. The areas of cortical thinning over time in the placebo group were more extensive, including the frontal, temporal, and parietal areas, whereas these areas in the MSC group were less extensive. Correlation analysis indicated that declines in MoCA scores and phonemic fluency during the follow-up period were significantly correlated with cortical thinning of the frontal and posterior temporal areas and anterior temporal areas in MSA patients, respectively. In contrast, no significant correlations were observed in the MSC group. These results suggest that MSC treatment in patients with MSA may modulate cortical thinning over time and related cognitive performance, inferring a future therapeutic candidate for cognitive disorders.

"24953703","Feasibility of the cognitive assessment scale for stroke patients (CASP) vs. MMSE and MoCA in aphasic left hemispheric stroke patients.","INTRODUCTION: Post-stroke aphasia makes it difficult to assess cognitive deficiencies. We thus developed the CASP, which can be administered without using language. Our objective was to compare the feasibility of the CASP, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in aphasic stroke patients.MATERIAL AND METHODS: All aphasic patients consecutively admitted to seven French rehabilitation units during a 4-month period after a recent first left hemispheric stroke were assessed with CASP, MMSE and MoCA. We determined the proportion of patients in whom it was impossible to administer at least one item from these 3 scales, and compared their administration times.RESULTS: Forty-four patients were included (age 64±15, 26 males). The CASP was impossible to administer in eight of them (18%), compared with 16 for the MMSE (36%, P=0.05) and 13 for the MoCA (30%, P=0.21, NS). It was possible to administer the CASP in all of the patients with expressive aphasia, whereas the MMSE and the MoCA could not be administered. Administration times were longer for the CASP (13±4min) than for the MMSE (8±3min, P&lt;10(-6)) and the MoCA (11±5min, P=0.23, NS).CONCLUSION: The CASP is more feasible than the MMSE and the MoCA in aphasic stroke patients."
"24949653","Examining physiological responses across different driving maneuvers during an on-road driving task: a pilot study comparing older and younger drivers.","OBJECTIVE: This pilot study aimed to investigate physiological responses during an on-road driving task for older and younger drivers.METHODS: Five older drivers (mean age = 74.60 years [2.97]) and 5 younger drivers (mean age = 30.00 years [3.08]) completed a series of cognitive assessments (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA], Mini Mental Status Examination [MMSE]; Trail Making Test [Trails A and Trails B]) and an on-road driving task along a predetermined, standardized urban route in their own vehicle. Driving performance was observed and scored by a single trained observer using a standardized procedure, where driving behaviors (appropriate and inappropriate) were scored for intersection negotiation, lane changing, and merging. During the on-road driving task, participants' heart rate (HR) was monitored with an unobtrusive physiological monitor.RESULTS: Younger drivers performed significantly better on all cognitive assessments compared to older drivers (MoCA: t(8) = 3.882, P &lt;.01; MMSE: t(8) = 2.954, P &lt;.05; Trails A: t(8) = -2.499, P &lt;.05; Trails B: t(8) = -3.262, P &lt;.05). Analyses of participants' performance during the on-road driving task revealed a high level of appropriate overall driving behavior (M = 87%, SD = 7.62, range = 73-95%), including intersection negotiation (M = 89%, SD = 8.37%), lane changing (M = 100%), and merging (M = 53%, SD = 28.28%). The overall proportion of appropriate driving behavior did not significantly differ across age groups (younger drivers: M = 87.6%, SD = 9.04; older drivers: M = 87.0%, SD = 6.96; t(8) = 0.118, P =.91).CONCLUSIONS: Although older drivers scored lower than younger drivers on the cognitive assessments, there was no indication of cognitive overload among older drivers based on HR response to the on-road driving task. The results provide preliminary evidence that mild age-related cognitive impairment may not pose a motor vehicle crash hazard for the wider older driver population. To maintain safe mobility of the aging population, further research into the specific crash risk factors in the older driver population is warranted."
"24938319","Alterations in the gray matter volume in transient ischemic attack: a voxel-based morphometry study.","BACKGROUND: Several studies have emphasized that transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients suffered functional impairments, but whether underlying morphological alterations exist remains unclear. This study aims to detect possible gray matter volume (GMV) alterations in patients with TIA using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) method.METHODS: High-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images of 21 patients were compared with 21 healthy controls of matching age, gender, and education. Changes in the GMV were observed using VBM technique, followed by two-sample t-test analysis to detect the differences in the GMV between TIA patients and healthy controls. Correlations between the clinical parameters and the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scores, and the altered GMV in TIAs, were investigated.RESULTS: Two-sample t-test analysis revealed a significant GMV reduction in specific regions in the default mode network (DMN) in TIA patients, including the bilateral medial frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and precuneus. No correlation was found between the reduced GMV and MoCA scores and clinical parameters.CONCLUSION: Transient ischemic attack patients showed widespread morphology atrophy in DMN, suggesting that, despite the absence of a cerebral infarction, ischemic injury may induce structural abnormalities and eventually contribute to functional impairments in TIA patients. Our results may provide a valuable basis for the pathophysiological mechanism related to the cognitive dysfunction of TIA from the view of brain morphology."
"24926405","Correlation of sleep disturbance and cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease.","OBJECTIVE: Cognitive impairment is a common nonmotor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) and is associated with high mortality, caregiver distress, and nursing home placement. The risk factors for cognitive decline in PD patients include advanced age, longer disease duration, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, hallucinations, excessive daytime sleepiness, and nontremor symptoms including bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability, and gait disturbance. We conducted a cross-sectional study to determine which types of sleep disturbances are related to cognitive function in PD patients.METHODS: A total of 71 PD patients (29 males, mean age 66.46 ± 8.87 years) were recruited. All patients underwent the Mini- Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Korean Version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessments (MoCA-K) to assess global cognitive function. Sleep disorders were evaluated with the Stanford Sleepiness Scale, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, and Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale in Korea (PDSS).RESULTS: The ISI was correlated with the MMSE, and total PDSS scores were correlated with the MMSE and the MoCA-K. In each item of the PDSS, nocturnal restlessness, vivid dreams, hallucinations, and nocturnal motor symptoms were positively correlated with the MMSE, and nocturnal restlessness and vivid dreams were significantly related to the MoCA-K. Vivid dreams and nocturnal restlessness are considered the most powerful correlation factors with global cognitive function, because they commonly had significant correlation to cognition assessed with both the MMSE and the MoCA-K.CONCLUSIONS: We found a correlation between global cognitive function and sleep disturbances, including vivid dreams and nocturnal restlessness, in PD patients."

A proportion of patients with UIA remain untreated. We investigated to assess cognitive function, depression, anxiety and quality of life (QoL) in Chinese patients with untreated UIA. Thirty one Chinese patients with untreated UIA and 25 healthy controls were identified and matched for variables including age, sex, and living area. Cognitive function was evaluated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Depression, anxiety and QoL were screened with the Self-Rating Depression Scale, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, and Short Form-36, respectively. Non-parametric tests were used for comparisons between groups. No patient had cognitive dysfunction at 1 month or 1 year after detection of UIA. However, a significant decrease of overall MoCA subscores was found in 30 (97%) of 31 patients 5 years after UIA discovery, suggestive of mild cognitive impairment. A significant decrease in depression and anxiety was found in patients over time. QoL in patients was reduced most prominently in psychosocial function and social activities 1 year after detection of UIA, but these improved to within normal limits at the end of the follow-up period. For Chinese patients with untreated UIA, depression, anxiety and reduced QoL may be short-term complications. Mild cognitive impairment may be a long-term complication."

"24876438","Autonomy of patients with type 2 diabetes with an insulin pump device: is it predictable?","BACKGROUND: Insulin pump therapy may be offered to patients with type 2 diabetes that is not controlled by multiple daily injections. Patients with type 2 diabetes may suffer from unrecognized cognitive disabilities, which may compromise the use of a pump device.METHODS: To predict patient autonomy, we evaluated 39 patients with type 2 diabetes from our database (n = 143) after continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) initiation using (1) an autonomy questionnaire evaluating the patient's cognitive and operative capacities for CSII utilization, (2) the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) for the detection of mild cognitive disabilities, (3) the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) for the detection of anxiety and depression, and (4) the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ). Patients were selected to constitute 3 groups matched for age, with different degrees of autonomy at discharge after the initial training program: complete (n = 13), partial (n = 13), or no autonomy (n = 13).RESULTS: The satisfaction level with the pump device was high. At the last follow-up visit, only 23% of patients did not reach complete autonomy. The autonomy score correlated fairly with the MOCA score (R = 0.771, P &lt; .001). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that at a cut-off score of 24, the MOCA identified autonomous versus dependent patients at long-term follow-up (area under the ROC curve [AUC], 0.893; sensitivity, 81%; specificity, 81%). The HADS correlated negatively with the autonomy score, and the sociocultural level also influenced autonomy with pump utilization.CONCLUSION: Patients with type 2 diabetes with partial autonomy at discharge may progress to complete autonomy. The MOCA and HADS may help predict a patient's ability to manage with a pump device."

Cognitive function was assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Korean version (MoCA-K). A MoCA-K score &lt;23 was defined as MCI.RESULTS: The prevalence of MCI was 32.7%. In a logistic regression analysis, age (=74 years old vs. 65-68 years old; odds ratio [OR], 3.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.55 to 8.82; P=0.003), educational background (college graduation vs. no school or elementary school graduation; OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.46; P=0.001), and systolic blood pressure (=135 mm Hg vs. =120 mm Hg; OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.29 to 8.17; P=0.012) were associated with MCI.CONCLUSION: More concentrated efforts focused on early detection and appropriate management of MCI may be required in older Korean adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus."
"24836461","Pulsion severity showed a good correlation with cognitive function in Parkinson's disease.","OBJECTIVES: To examine the correlation between cognitive impairment and postural instability in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients by using posturography.METHODS: We investigated 88 PD patients comparing clinical scorings of cognitive functions and pulsion severity, and quantitative measurement of postural instability by posturography with the length of the center of gravity (LNG) and envelope area (ENV).RESULTS: The number of patients with severe pulsion increased in PD with disease progression assessed by Hoehn and Yahr (H &amp; Y) scale regardless of age, and a significant correlation was observed between the pulsion severity and both LNG (R <U+200A>=<U+200A> 0.4242) and ENV (R <U+200A>=<U+200A> 0.4335). Both LNG and ENV showed a good correlation with all cognitive assessments such as mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), and frontal assessment battery (FAB), suggesting that cognitive impairment became worse with the longer LNG and the larger ENV. Among the cognitive assessments, MoCA showed the highest correlation (R <U+200A>=<U+200A> 0.56-0.62) with both LNG and ENV, reflecting that MoCA is the most sensitive and reliable screening for dementia in PD.DISCUSSION: The present study showed that posturography is useful to quantify the pulsion severity in PD patients, that pulsion severity and cognitive function showed a good correlation especially assessed by MoCA, and that posturography thus provides a more detailed quantitative correlation of postural instability to cognitive impairment."
"24826506","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment in persons with traumatic brain injury.","The objective of this study was to examine the performance of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The MoCA was administered to 214 patients with TBI during their acute care hospitalization in a Level 1 trauma center. The results showed that patients with severe TBI had lower scores on the MoCA compared with patients with mild and moderate TBI, F(2, 211) = 10.35, p = .0001. This difference was found for visuospatial/executive, attention, and orientation subtests (p &lt; .05). Linear regression demonstrated that age, education, TBI severity, and the presence of neurological antecedents were the best predictors of cognitive impairments explaining 42% of the total variability of the MoCA. This information can enable clinicians to predict early cognitive impairments and plan cognitive rehabilitation earlier in the recovery process."
"24806666","Contributions of the Computer-Administered Neuropsychological Screen for Mild Cognitive Impairment (CANS-MCI) for the diagnosis of MCI in Brazil.","ABSTRACT Background: The Computer-Administered Neuropsychological Screen for Mild Cognitive Impairment (CANS-MCI) is a computer-based cognitive screening instrument that involves automated administration and scoring and immediate analyses of test sessions. The objective of this study was to translate and culturally adapt the Brazilian Portuguese version of the CANS-MCI (CANS-MCI-BR) and to evaluate its reliability and validity for the diagnostic screening of MCI and dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Methods: The test was administered to 97 older adults (mean age 73.41 ± 5.27 years) with at least four years of formal education (mean education 12.23 ± 4.48 years). Participants were classified into three diagnostic groups according to global cognitive status (normal controls, n = 41; MCI, n = 35; AD, n = 21) based on clinical data and formal neuropsychological assessments. Results: The results indicated high internal consistency (Cronbach's a = 0.77) in the total sample. Three-month test-retest reliability correlations were significant and robust (0.875; p &lt; 0.001). A moderate level of concurrent validity was attained relative to the screening test for MCI (MoCA test, r = 0.76, p &lt; 0.001). Confirmatory factor analysis supported the three-factor model of the original test, i.e., memory, language/spatial fluency, and executive function/mental control. Goodness of fit indicators were strong (Bentler Comparative Fit Index = 0.96, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.09). Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses suggested high sensitivity and specificity (81% and 73% respectively) to screen for possible MCI cases. Conclusions: The CANS-MCI-BR maintains adequate psychometric characteristics that render it suitable to identify elderly adults with probable cognitive impairment to whom a more extensive evaluation by formal neuropsychological tests may be required."
"24757105","Serial montreal cognitive assessments demonstrate reversible cognitive impairment in patients with acute transient ischemic attack and minor stroke.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cognitive changes after ischemic stroke are often overlooked, particularly acutely and in patients with mild or transient deficits. We assessed patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA)/minor stroke with serial cognitive screening tests. We tested the hypothesis that mild acute deficits are transient and improve after TIA/minor stroke.METHODS: Patients with acute TIA/minor ischemic stroke, without a history of cognitive impairment, presenting with a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score =3 were assessed &lt;72 hours of onset. Patients were administered the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at days 1, 7, 30, and 90. Cognitive impairment was defined as MoCA &lt;26 and MMSE =26.RESULTS: One hundred patients with a median (interquartile range) National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score of 1 (2) and median age of 68 (20) years were included. Baseline median MoCA score (26 [4]) was lower than the MMSE (29 [2]; P&lt;0.0001). Cognitive impairment was detected in 54 of 100 patients (54%) with MoCA and 16 of 100 (16%; P=0.001) with MMSE. MoCA scores improved at day 7 (27 [5]), day 30 (28 [2]), and day 90 (28 [2]; P&lt;0.0001). Resolution of cognitive deficits was because of resolution of recall deficits.CONCLUSIONS: Acute temporary cognitive impairment after TIA/minor stroke is common. The MoCA is sensitive to these changes, but the MMSE is not. Routine cognitive assessment after TIA/minor stroke may be warranted and relevant to return to activities even when other neurological deficits are not evident."
"24733650","Uric formaldehyde levels are negatively correlated with cognitive abilities in healthy older adults.","Recent studies have shown that the abnormal accumulation of endogenous formaldehyde could be a critical factor in age-related cognitive decline. The aim of this study was to estimate the correlation between uric formaldehyde and general cognitive abilities in a community-based elderly population, and to measure the extent and direction in which the correlation varied with demographic characteristics. Using a double-blind design, formaldehyde in human urine was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (n = 604), and general cognitive abilities were measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Demographic characteristics, in terms of age, gender, residential region, and education were taken into consideration. We found that uric formaldehyde levels were inversely correlated with the MoCA score, and the concentration varied with demographic features: higher odds of a high formaldehyde level occurred among the less educated and those living in old urban or rural areas. In cytological experiments, the level of cellular formaldehyde released into the medium increased as SH-SY5Y and BV2 cells were incubated for three days. Formaldehyde in excess impaired the processes of N2a cells and neurites of primary cultured rat hippocampal cells. However, removal of formaldehyde markedly rescued and regenerated the processes of N2a cells. These results demonstrated a negative correlation between the endogenous formaldehyde and general cognitive abilities. High formaldehyde levels could be a risk factor for cognitive impairment in older adults, and could be developed as a non-invasive marker for detection and monitoring of age-related cognitive impairment."
"24627152","Edentulism associates with worse cognitive performance in community-dwelling elders in rural Ecuador: results of the Atahualpa project.","Studies in industrialized nations suggest that severe edentulism correlates with cognitive impairment, but there is little information on this association in underserved populations. We conducted a community-based study to assess whether edentulism associates with cognitive impairment in elders living in rural Ecuador. Atahualpa residents aged =60 years were identified during a door-to-door census and evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Persons were classified into two groups according to whether they have severe edentulism (&lt;10 remaining teeth) or not. In addition, a questionnaire allowed self-rating of oral health. A total of 274 persons (mean age 69.6 ± 7.7 years; 59% women) were included. Persons with &lt;10 remaining teeth (n = 116) have significantly lower MoCA scores than those with =10 teeth (n =158), after adjusting for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, depression and dementia (ß = -1.06, p = 0.03). Self-rated poor oral health was more prevalent among persons with &lt;10 teeth (p &lt; 0.0001), but did not correlate with MoCA scores (good vs. poor, ß = -0.89, p = 0.89). Severe edentulism is associated with poor cognitive performance in elders living in rural Ecuador. Public health campaigns directed to improve oral health may facilitate early recognition of persons with cognitive impairment in underserved populations."
"24590077","Grooved pegboard predicates more of cognitive than motor involvement in Parkinson's disease.","The Grooved Pegboard Test (GPT) was conceived as a test of manual dexterity, upper-limb motor speed, and hand-eye coordination. The aim of our study was to test the componential structure of the GPT on an archetypal model of motor impairment, Parkinson's disease (PD). A total of 45 PD patients (33 males, 12 females; age M = 67, range = 49-81; PD duration M = 10, range = 6-20 years; H/Y stage 2, range = 2-3) and 20 age- and education-matched controls (14 males, 6 females; age M = 66, range = 48-80) were included. All participants were investigated using the GPT, Short Falls Efficacy Scale-International, Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Non-Motor Symptom Scale. Patients were followed for 6 months, using fall diaries and monthly phone calls to define PD fallers (falls = 1; n = 27) and PD nonfallers (falls = 0; n = 18). Using structural equation modeling, the GPT predicted performance on the MoCA (p &lt; .001), but not on the FAB (p = .29). In conclusion, analysis of the structure of the GPT provided evidence about important cognitive features, in addition to the motor component of this test in PD. "
"24578463","Validation of Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Discriminant Power of Montreal Cognitive Assessment Subtests in Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer Dementia in Turkish Population.","Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a new cognitive tool developed for screening mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The authors examined validity of MoCA and discriminating power of subtests in a Turkish population comprising of 474 participants (246 healthy controls, 114 subjects with MCI and 114 subjects with dementia). The ANCOVAs showed that age and education had a main effect on MoCA scores. Cut scores were computed according to different education levels. The overall cut-off values for MCI and dementia were found to be lower compared to western studies. MoCA was found to have good internal consistency. The subtests most useful in discriminating MCI from healthy controls were recall, visuospatial and language, while in discriminating dementia from MCI were visuospatial, orientation and attention subtests. The results demonstrated that MoCA is a valid and reliable instrument in screening MCI, and compared with the MMSE, MoCA was proved to have superior sensitivity and specificity in detecting MCI. "
"24578460","The Lawton Instrumental Activities Daily Living/Activities Daily Living Scales: A Sensitive Test to Alzheimer Disease in Community-Dwelling Elderly People?","OBJECTIVE: To examine the diagnostic ability of the Lawton Instrumental Activities Daily Living (IADLs) scale and the Activities Daily Living (ADLs) scale as a sensitive tool to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in community-dwelling elderly people.DESIGN: In an old age memory outpatient center, among patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD dementia or no dementia supported by at least 6 months of follow-up, we looked back at the baseline Lawton IADL scale (short version IADL-4 item), ADL scale, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) values.RESULTS: There were 109 patients with AD and 53 nondemented individuals (81.4 ± 4.6 years). The sensitivity of ADL scale or IADL-4 item or the MMSE was low (52%-57%). The most efficient AD classification used both the IADLs-4 item and the MOCA with a threshold score of 20. Besides age and memory scores, the main correlates of IADLs scale or ADLs scale were executive, neuropsychiatric, vascular, and extrapyramidal scores.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the Lawton IADLs-4 item scale and ADLs scale lack sensitivity to AD dementia in elderly people and support a better sensitivity of MOCA rather than MMSE and IADLs-4 item/ADLs at the expense of specificity."
"24577459","Post-stroke cognitive impairment: high prevalence and determining factors in a cohort of mild stroke.","BACKGROUND: Because of the aging population and a rise in the number of stroke survivors, the prevalence of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) is increasing.OBJECTIVE: To identify the factors associated with 3-month PSCI.METHODS: All consecutive stroke patients without pre-stroke dementia, mild cognitive disorders, or severe aphasia hospitalized in the Neurology Department of Dijon, University Hospital, France (November 2010 - February 2012) were included in this prospective cohort study. Demographics, vascular risk factors, and stroke data were collected. A first cognitive evaluation was performed during the hospitalization using the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA). Patients assessable at 3 months were categorized as cognitively impaired if the MMSE score was =26/30 and MOCA &lt;26/30 or if the neuropsychological battery confirmed PSCI when the MMSE and MOCA were discordant. Multivariable logistic models were used to determine factors associated with 3-month PSCI.RESULTS: Among the 280 patients included, 220 were assessable at 3 months. The overall frequency of 3-month PSCI was 47.3%, whereas that of dementia was 7.7%. In multivariable analyses, 3-month PSCI was associated with age, low education level, a history of diabetes mellitus, acute confusion, silent infarcts, and functional handicap at discharge. MMSE and MOCA scores during hospitalization were associated with 3-month PSCI (OR = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.54-0.74; p &lt; 0.0001 and OR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.59-0.76; p &lt; 0.0001, respectively).CONCLUSION: Our study underlines the high frequency of PSCI in a cohort of mild stroke. The early cognitive diagnosis of stroke patients could be useful by helping physicians to identify those at a high risk of developing PSCI."
"24560331","The effect of radical treatment and rehabilitation on muscle mass and strength: a randomized trial in stages I-III lung cancer patients.","OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the impact of an oncological treatment on muscle mass and strength in patients with lung cancer and the impact of a subsequent rehabilitation program. This study investigates the effect of radical treatment and post-treatment pulmonary rehabilitation on muscle mass and strength in patients with lung cancer and the relationship between muscle mass and strength.METHODS: Lung cancer patients, candidate for radical treatment, were randomly (2:1) allocated after radical treatment to either standard follow up (CON) or a 12-week rehabilitation training program (RT). Muscle mass was estimated by bioelectric impedance and CT-scan. Muscle strength was estimated by measuring quadriceps force (QF) with a hand held dynamometer. All variables were measured before (M1) and after radical treatment (M2), and at the earliest 12 weeks after randomization (M3). Data are presented as means with standard deviation.RESULTS: 45 lung cancer patients (age: 65 years (9)) participated in the study. At M2, both muscle cross sectional area (MCSA) and QF were significantly decreased (p&lt;0.05). 28 patients were randomized. 13/18 RT and 9/10 CON patients ended the trial. At M3, RT-patients improved significantly their MCSA compared to CON-patients (<U+0394>MCSA: 6 cm(2) (6) (p=0.003) vs. 1cm(2) (11) (p=0.8)).CONCLUSION: Muscle mass and strength: (1) are decreased at presentation in a substantial part of lung cancer patients; (2) are significantly negatively affected by radical treatment and (3) completely recover after a 12 week structured rehabilitation program, whereas a further decline was observed in CON-patients."
"24556891","Variability of cognitive performance during hemodialysis: standardization of cognitive assessment.","AIMS: Up to 70% of hemodialysis patients over the age of 54 have relevant cognitive impairment. No standardized protocol for the evaluation and monitoring of this population is available today. We hypothesized that the dialysis procedure and the testing environment induce fluctuations of cognitive performance.METHODS: 26 hemodialysis patients were randomly tested using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) before, during and after hemodialysis and inside the dialysis room or alone in a separate room. Tests were performed at weekly intervals using five test variations to prevent learning effects. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was performed as a reference test.RESULTS: MoCA scores significantly differed between the conditions: 'before hemodialysis' revealed the best MoCA score as compared to 'during hemodialysis' or 'after hemodialysis' (p = 0.013). During the combined condition 'before dialysis AND separate room', best performance was achieved (p &lt; 0.001). The BP decline had no significant influence on cognitive performance, whereas the fluid shift showed a significant impact (p = 0.008).CONCLUSION: Cognitive performance in hemodialysis patients highly depends on the time point and testing environment. Therefore, we strongly suggest a standardization, using the MoCA before hemodialysis in a separate room, in order to make testing results of future research in this field comparable."
"24548440","[Association between obesity and cognition impairment in patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome].","OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between obesity and cognition impairment in patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS).METHODS: A total of 425 eligible patients with moderate-to-severe OSAHS were screened for this retrospective study at Sleep Center, Second Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University from January 2008 to January 2013. Based on body mass index (BMI), they were categorized into normal weight (18.5 = BMI&lt;24, n = 67), mild overweight (24 = BMI&lt;26, n = 100), severe overweight (26 = BMI&lt;28, n = 134) and obese (BMI = 28, n = 124) groups. They were examined by overnight polysomnography (PSG). And cognitive functions were assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) questionnaires. MoCA scores, clinical and polysomnographic variables were compared between the groups. And the correlations between MoCA scores and clinical and PSG parameters were further evaluated by stepwise multivariate regression. Two-way analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA) was performed to examine the effects of obesity and OSAHS on MoCA score.RESULTS: The scores of MoCA progressively decreased across the spectrum from mild overweight to obese groups. The highest BMI group (obese group) had the lowest MoCA score (25.45 ± 2.35 vs 26.26 ± 2.01, 26.29 ± 2.60, 26.05 ± 2.51, P = 0.030, 0.010, 0.048). The evaluations of MoCA subdomains further revealed selective reductions. Compare to normal weight group, the score of visuospatial and executive function, memory/delayed recall significant decreased in obese and severe overweight groups (visuospatial and executive function: 4.48 ± 0.63 vs 4.07 ± 0.94, 4.13 ± 1.04, P = 0.022, 0.048; memory/delayed recall: 3.54 ± 0.90 vs 2.77 ± 1.20, 2.87 ± 1.30, P = 0.001, 0.004). Stepwise multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that MoCA scores were correlated significantly with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), BMI, age and years of education. Two-way ANOVA revealed that both obesity and OSAHS had independent effects on MoCA score (P = 0.004). The interactions between the effect of obesity and OSAHS on cognitive score were insignificant. It indicated that the effect of BMI on cognitive function did not change with AHI.CONCLUSIONS: In OSAHS patients, obesity aggravates cognitive impairment independently of AHI. And obesity is one of the most important influencing factors of cognitive function."
"24503284","Neuropsychological screening as a standard of care during discharge from psychiatric hospitalization: the preliminary psychometrics of the CNS Screen.","Cost-prohibitive factors currently prevent a warranted integration of neuropsychological screenings into routine psychiatric evaluations, as a standard of care. To overcome this challenge, the current study examined the psychometric properties of a new computerized measure-the CNS Screen. One hundred and twenty six psychiatric inpatients completed the CNS Screen, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Rated (QIDS-SR16) on the day of hospital discharge. Statistical analysis established convergent validity with a moderate correlation between the self-administered CNS Screen and the clinician-administered MoCA (r=0.64). Discriminant validity was implicated by a non-significant correlation with the QIDS-SR16. Concurrent validity was supported by a moderate, negative correlation with patients' age (r=-0.62). In addition, consistent with previous findings, patients with psychotic disorders exhibited significantly poorer performance on the CNS Screen than patients with a mood disorder. Similarly, patients with a formal disability status scored significantly lower than other patients. The CNS Screen was well tolerated by all patients. With further development, this type of measure may provide a cost-effective approach to expanding neuropsychological screenings on inpatient psychiatric units."
"24498389","Abnormal intrinsic brain activity patterns in patients with subcortical ischemic vascular dementia.","OBJECTIVES: To investigate the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) alteration of whole brain in patients with subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with SIVD and 35 control subjects were included in this study. All of them underwent structural MRI and rs-fMRI scan. The structural data were processed using the voxel-based morphometry 8 toolbox (VBM8). The rs-fMRI data were processed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) and Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF) software. Within-group analysis was performed with a one-sample Student's t-test to identify brain regions with ALFF value larger than the mean. Intergroup analysis was performed with a two-sample Student's t-test to identify ALFF differences of whole brain between SIVD and control subjects. Partial correlations between ALFF values and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were analyzed in the SIVD group across the parameters of age, gender, years of education, and GM volume.RESULTS: Within-group analysis showed that the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), inferior parietal lobe (IPL), occipital lobe, and adjacent precuneus had significantly higher standardized ALFF values than the global mean ALFF value in both groups. Compared to the controls, patients with SIVD presented lower ALFF values in the bilateral precuneus and higher ALFF values in the bilateral ACC, left insula and hippocampus. Including GM volume as an extra covariate, the ALFF inter-group difference exhibited highly similar spatial patterns to those without GM volume correcting. Close negative correlations were found between the ALFF values of left insula and the MoCA and MMSE scores of SIVD patients.CONCLUSION: SIVD is associated with a unique spontaneous aberrant activity of rs-fMRI signals, and measurement of ALFF in the precuneus, ACC, insula, and hippocampus may aid in the detection of SIVD."
"24472343","A Bahasa Malaysia version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment: validation in stroke.","BACKGROUND: Many stroke research trials do not include assessment of cognitive function. A Very Early Rehabilitation Trial (AVERT) is an international multicenter study that includes the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as an outcome. At the Malaysian AVERT site, completion of the MoCA has been limited by low English proficiency in some participants. We aimed to develop a Bahasa Malaysia (BM) version of the MoCA and to validate it in a stroke population.METHODS: The original English version of the MoCA was translated into BM and then back-translated to ensure accuracy. Feasibility testing in a group of stroke patients prompted minor changes to the BM MoCA. In the validation phase, a larger group of bilingual stroke patients completed both the original English MoCA and the finalized BM MoCA, with presentation order counter-balanced.RESULTS: Forty stroke patients participated, with a mean age of 57.2 (SD = 10.3). Agreement between BM MoCA and English MoCA was strong (intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.81, 95% CI 0.68-0.90). Scores on BM MoCA were slightly higher than scores on English MoCA (median absolute difference = 2.0, IQR 0-3.5), and this difference was present regardless of which version was completed first.CONCLUSIONS: The existence of a validated BM version of the MoCA will be of major benefit to clinicians and researchers in Malaysia and the wider South-east Asian region, where the Malay language is used by over 200 million people."

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is accepted as a valid screening tool for mild cognitive impairment due to cerebral ischaemia. Whether MoCA is independently associated with excellent outcome [a score of 0 on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) or 18/18 on the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale] 1 year after aSAH was assessed.METHODS: Hong Kong Chinese aSAH patients were assessed prospectively by means of the MoCA, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), mRS and IADL scale at 1 year. This multicenter prospective observational study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov of the US National Institutes of Health (NCT01038193).RESULTS: In all, 194 patients completed the assessments at 1 year. After adjustment for age, both excellent IADL and mRS outcomes were associated with MoCA (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.3, P &lt; 0.001, and OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.2, P = 0.001, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: MoCA-assessed cognitive function is an important determinant for excellent outcomes after aSAH."
"24444381","Functioning of long-term survivors of first-ever intracerebral hemorrhage.","OBJECTIVES: There are few data on long-term functional outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We aimed to assess functional dependency and cognitive impairment in long-term survivors of first-ever intracerebral hemorrhage.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between August and November 2011, we contacted all survivors from a cohort of 134 consecutive patients hospitalized with a first-ever ICH in the period 2005-2009 in a well-defined catchment area. We did an extensive face-to-face follow-up including the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), the Barthel Index (BI), and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).RESULTS: Fifty-one patients (38%) were alive. Fifty agreed to take part in the follow-up. The median follow-up time was 3.8 years. Thirty-four patients (68%) were independent (mRS 0-2) and 16 (32%) dependent (mRS 3-5). Factors independently associated with dependency were leukoaraiosis score (OR 2.3 per increasing point, P = 0.003) and female sex (OR 5.1, P = 0.038). Twenty-seven patients (61%) had cognitive impairment (MoCA = 23). Factors independently associated with cognitive impairment were age (OR 2.4 per 10 years, P = 0.010) and lobar ICH location (OR 14.1, P = 0.016).CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of long-term survivors of ICH in Southern Norway live functionally independent lives in their private homes. Dependency is linked to leukoaraiosis and female sex. Cognitive impairment is common and linked to lobar location of ICH."
"24406947","The Relationship between Older Drivers' Performance on the Driving Observation Schedule (eDOS) and Cognitive Performance.","OBJECTIVE: The Driving Observation Schedule (eDOS) was developed for use in the Candrive/Ozcandrive five-year prospective study of older drivers to observe the driving behavior of older drivers and monitor changes in driving behaviors over time. The aim of this study is to describe participants' driving performance during the eDOS driving task and investigate the association between driving performance and cognitive measures.METHODS: A subset of Ozcandrive participants (n = 144, 104 male [72%], 40 female [28%], Mean age = 81.49 years, SD = 3.58 years, Range: 76 - 96 years) completed the eDOS driving task. Participants drove to their selected destinations (up to 4 locations), with observations of driving behaviors (both inappropriate and appropriate) recorded for specific driving maneuvers: intersection negotiation, lane-changing, merging, low speed maneuvers and maneuver-free driving. Driving behaviors (e.g. signalling, speed regulation, gap acceptance, lane position, 'critical errors') were scored by a trained observer and participants received an overall eDOS driving task score (Maximum = 100 points). Participants also completed a series of cognitive assessments as part of the Year 2 Candrive/Ozcandrive assessment protocols.RESULTS: The overall eDOS driving task score was very high (M = 95.77; SD = 5.15; Range = 65.63 - 100). Detailed analyses of participants' driving behavior revealed a high level of appropriate driving behavior (96%, n = 5,935 maneuvers), with few errors (4%, n = 252 maneuvers). While most participants' performance on the cognitive assessments was high, some scores were below the criteria for cogntive impairment (BIC) according to conventional benchmarks: (MoCA: M = 26.56, SD = 2.12, Range = 19 - 30, % BIC = 28%; MMSE: M = 29.10, SD = 1.01, Range = 26-30, %BIC = 0%; Trails B: M = 111.66, SD = 43.53, Range = 50 - 301, %BIC = 6%). There was no significant relationship observed between participants' overall eDOS driving task scores and age (r (144) = -0.17, p &gt; 0.05), and performance on various cognitive assessments including: MoCA (r (144) = 0.07, p &gt; 0.1), MMSE (r (144) = 0.03, p &gt; 0.5), Trail Making Test B (r (144) = 0.09, p &gt; 0.1).IMPLICATIONS: Preliminary analyses of the eDOS driving task revealed a high level of appropriate driving behavior among Ozcandrive older drivers. Despite some participants' cognitive performance suggesting impairment, participants' overall eDOS driving task scores were not significantly related to cognitive performance. This finding is consistent with previous research suggesting some older drivers are able to compensate well for age-related cognitive impairment."
"24395708","Predictors of cognitive impairment in an early stage Parkinson's disease cohort.","The impact of Parkinson's disease (PD) dementia is substantial and has major functional and socioeconomic consequences. Early prediction of future cognitive impairment would help target future interventions. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and fluency tests were administered to 486 patients with PD within 3.5 years of diagnosis, and the results were compared with those from 141 controls correcting for age, sex, and educational years. Eighteen-month longitudinal assessments were performed in 155 patients with PD. The proportion of patients classified with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia varied considerably, depending on the MoCA and MMSE thresholds used. With the MoCA total score at screening threshold, 47.7%, 40.5%, and 11.7% of patients with PD were classified with normal cognition, MCI, and dementia, respectively; by comparison, 78.7% and 21.3% of controls had normal cognition and MCI, respectively. Cognitive impairment was predicted by lower education, increased age, male sex, and quantitative motor and non-motor (smell, depression, and anxiety) measures. Longitudinal data from 155 patients with PD over 18 months showed significant reductions in MoCA scores, but not in MMSE scores, with 21.3% of patients moving from normal cognition to MCI and 4.5% moving from MCI to dementia, although 13.5% moved from MCI to normal; however, none of the patients with dementia changed their classification. The MoCA may be more sensitive than the MMSE in detecting early baseline and longitudinal cognitive impairment in PD, because it identified 25.8% of those who experienced significant cognitive decline over 18 months. Cognitive decline was associated with worse motor and non-motor features, suggesting that this reflects a faster progressive phenotype."
"24390367","High prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder in HIV-infected patients with a baseline CD4 count = 350 cells/µL in Shanghai, China.","This study sought to determine the prevalence and risk factors of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) in HIV-infected patients with a baseline CD4 count = 350 cells/µL in Shanghai, China. Subjects were 309 HIV-infected patients with a baseline CD4 count = 350 cells/µL. General demographic and clinical information were collected by patient interview. Patients' cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), combined with a questionnaire on cognitive complaints. The median age of patients was 34 years (IQR: 28-43.5). In terms of sex, 272 (88.0%) of the patients were male. Of the patients, 236 (76.4%) had been on antiretroviral treatment (ART) (for a median duration of 14 months, IQR: 1-29 months) before the study. Of the patients, 183 (59.2%) mentioned having a cognitive disorder. MoCA screening revealed that the prevalence of HAND was 48.2% and that HAND was more prevalent in patients with cognitive complaints (53.0%) than in patients with no such complaints (41.3%) (p = 0.042). Multivariate analysis indicated that HAND was associated with being female (p = 0.006), being older (p &lt; 0.001), having a lower level of education (p &lt; 0.001), and longer use of efavirenz in an ART regimen (p = 0.040). This study found that HAND frequently developed in HIV-infected patients with a baseline CD4 count = 350 cells/µL in Shanghai, China. Being older, being female, having a low level of education, and receiving efavirenz treatment for a longer period may be associated with a greater risk of developing HAND. This study suggests that HAND should be routinely screened for in all newly diagnosed HIV-positive patients, and especially in those with the aforementioned risk factors for developing HAND. "

The aim of this study was to determine the level ofneurospecific proteins in 58 patients aged 16-30years with type I diabetes mellitus and cognitive disorders in comparison with 29 healthy controls of simnilar age. All the participants underwent neuropsychological testing based on the Montreal scale for rapid screening of cognitive disorders (MoCA-test). Protein S100, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and myelin basic protein served as early markers of cognitive dysfunction. The study revealed an enhanced level of neurospecific proteins that correlated with hyperglycemia and cognitive deficit (MoCA score 26)."
"25726800","[Some features of morphometric characteristics of the brain in patients with lacunar stroke].","Objective. To determine the structural-morphometric peculiarities of the brain in patients with lacunar ischemic stroke and their influence on cognitive functions. Material and methods. A morphometric analysis of brain CT was performed in 48 patients in the acute period of lacunar stroke. The width of subarachnoid spaces at the pole of the frontal lobes and the lateral sulcus was measured in axial sections, the ventricular system was assessed be several parameters. To adjust for the total head size, the data were evaluated as ratios. Mean populations values adjusted for age were used as normal values. Cognitive functions were measured with the MoCA scale. Results. It was determined that 71% of the patients had lacunar stroke as a result of the atrophic process in the brain. Atrophic process of the brain was often diagnosed in the age group of 61-70 years, multiple lacunar lesions were diagnosed in the group of 51-60 years. Cognitive functions were impaired in 91% of the patients in the acute period of lacunar stroke. Conclusion. Correlations between the level of cognitive functions and morphometric markers of subcortical atrophy demonstrate the leading role of the subcortical atrophy in the development and progression of cognitive deficit.

A full-night polysomnography and a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment were performed on all subjects. The disease severity was scored following the guideline recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine(AASM). Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 software for Windows.RESULTS: Compared with the healthy group, OSAHS patients had lower scores on MoCA (28.0 ± 1.1 vs. 22.6 ± 3.0), picture memory (15.7 ± 1.6 vs.11.9 ± 2.7), visual reproduction (12.6 ± 1.2 vs. 9.0 ± 2.2), logical memory (13.7 ± 1.7 vs. 10.9 ± 1.9), digit span forward [8.0(7.8-8.0) vs. 7.0(6.0-8.0)], digit span backward [5(5-6) vs. 4(3-4)], higher continuous wrong numbers on Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) [7(6-9) vs. 12.4 ± 4.9], lower categories completed [5(4-6) vs. 3.5(2.0-4.3)], longer Stroop Interference time (18.2 ± 9.5 vs. 44.8 ± 13.5); lower correct rate on 2-back test [91.0 ± 2.6 vs. 79(75-81)], longer response time on 2-back test [645 ± 21 vs. 691(653-752)], all with significant differences (P&lt;0.001). (2) In the OSAHS patients, with similar age and education background and BMI, there were positive correlations between scores on MoCA and SaO2mean (r=0.283, P=0.054), scores on SCWT and Sat90 (r=0.277, P=0.059); but there were negative correlations between scores on MoCA and TSat90 (r=-0.353, P=0.015), visual reproduction (r=-0.308, P=0.035), logical memory (r=-0.306, P=0.036), digit span forward (r=-0.297, P=0.043), backward (r=-0.322, P=0.027) and Sat90.CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that male patients with severe OSAHS had widespread executive dysfunctions (shifting, inhibition, updating) and memory impairments. Nighttime hypoxia and sleep fragmentation were closely related to the cognitive impairments of OSAHS."
"26669498","[Effect of cognitive stimulation in elderly community].","OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that the implementation of the Cognitive Stimulation (CS) program 'Making a Difference' (MD) improves cognition and depressive symptoms in retired community elders.METHOD: This was a multicenter quasi-experimental study of 45 community dwelling elders (38 women and 7 men), with a mean age of 75.29, from 3 day-care centers in rural, semi-rural and urban environments in the central region of Portugal. Participants attended 14 sessions twice a week over seven weeks. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) were administered at the following three time points: baseline, post-test, and follow-up.RESULTS: From baseline to post-test, there is a statistically significant difference in depressive symptoms (F=7.494; P=.010) explaining 21% of the variance (partial eta squared [<U+03B7>p(2)]=.21), power=.75, but there is no statistically significant difference in cognition. From post-test to follow-up, there is no difference in both cognition and depression outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed improvement in elders' depressive symptoms after a seven weeks intervention program but it did not have a protective effect after the three months follow-up. No evidence was found for its efficacy in improving cognition. Cognitive stimulation may be a useful in preventing elder's depressive symptoms when included in their health promotion care plan."
"26667660","Changes in Cognitive Status in COPD Patients Across Clinical Stages.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive disease, its prevalence increases with age. COPD is frequently associated with co-morbidities such as cognitive impairment, and their clinical relevance has risen in the recent past. Cognitive function may fluctuate with the variable components of COPD like hypoxaemia, hypercapnia, lung function, exacerbations or severity of the disease. The objectives of this study were to examine whether the cognitive status of COPD patients is different across clinical stages (exacerbation, at discharge and stable COPD) and also if there are cognitive areas that have more potential to change than others. Prospective observational clinical study: 62 patients admitted to hospital due to acute exacerbation of COPD were evaluated at hospital admission; 61 at discharge; and finally, 48 patients with stable COPD completed the study and were included in the analysis. Cognitive status was assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Our results show that all clinical variables improved from exacerbation to discharge COPD. MoCA total score, visuoconstructional, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall and orientation subscores improved significantly from exacerbation to discharge COPD (p &lt; 0.05). MoCA total score, visuoconstructional and naming subscores worsened significantly from discharge to stable COPD (p &lt; 0.05).

"26635601","Rapid Responsiveness to Practice Predicts Longer-Term Retention of Upper Extremity Motor Skill in Non-Demented Older Adults.","Skill acquisition is a form of motor learning that may provide key insights into the aging brain. Although previous work suggests that older adults learn novel motor tasks slower and to a lesser extent than younger adults, we have recently demonstrated no significant effect of chronological age on the rates and amounts of skill acquisition, nor on its long-term retention, in adults over the age of 65. To better understand predictors of skill acquisition in non-demented older adults, we now explore the relationship between early improvements in motor performance due to practice (i.e., rapid responsiveness) and longer-term retention of an upper extremity motor skill, and whether the extent of rapid responsiveness was associated with global cognitive status. Results showed significant improvements in motor performance within the first five (of 150) trials, and that this &quot;rapid responsiveness&quot; was predictive of skill retention 1 month later. Notably, the extent of rapid responsiveness was not dependent on global cognitive status, as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Thus, rapid responsiveness appears to be an important variable in longer-term neurorehabilitative efforts with older adults, regardless of their cognitive status. "
"26635008","Montreal Cognitive Assessment Performance in HIV/AIDS: Impact of Systemic Factors.","BACKGROUND: A large proportion of people living with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) suffer from neurocognitive impairment (NCI). The causes of the NCI are multifold in HIV infection although a subset of HIV/AIDS patients are affected by the spectrum syndrome, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). We investigated the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in relation to clinical, demographic and laboratory findings as well as its ability to predict symptomatic HAND (sHAND) among patients with HIV/AIDS.METHODS: All subjects were receiving regular HIV care including CD4+ T cell counts, plasma viral load measurements, clinical evaluations and antiretroviral therapy. The diagnosis of sHAND was based upon clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological assessments.RESULTS: Among HIV-1 seropositive subjects (n=125), ethnicity, education and employment were positively correlated with their MoCA scores (p&lt;0.05). In contrast, polypharmacy, central nervous system penetration-effectiveness (CPE) score, antiretroviral drug exposure, substance use and nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor side effects were negatively correlated with MoCA scores (p&lt;0.05). Of note, MoCA scores were not associated with CD4 T cell nadir levels, age, peak viral load, or veterans aging cohort study index. In subjects with or without sHAND, mean MoCA scores differed (sHAND, 22.8±3.51; non-HAND 25.2±2.64) (p&lt;0.05) with a receiver operating characteristic curve showing an area under curve of 0.71 and an optimal MoCA cut-off value of 23.5 when compared to the established diagnostic paradigm.CONCLUSIONS: MoCA scores were generally lower in this HIV/AIDS population compared to reported scores in the general population. MoCA performance was associated with multiple clinical variables but displayed limited predictive utility in detecting sHAND."

"26618003","Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Modified Mini Mental State Examination in African Americans.","Background. Sparse data limit the interpretation of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores, particularly in minority populations. Additionally, there are no published data on how MoCA scores compare to the widely used Modified Mini Mental State Examination (3MSE). We provide performance data on the MoCA in a large cohort of African Americans and compare 3MSE and MoCA scores, providing a &quot;crosswalk&quot; for interpreting scores. Methods. Five hundred and thirty African Americans with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in African American-Diabetes Heart Study-MIND, a cross-sectional study of cognition and structural and functional brain imaging. After excluding participants with possible cognitive impairment (n = 115), mean (SD) MoCA and 3MSE scores are presented stratified by age and education. Results. Participant mean age was 58.2 years (range: 35-83); 61% were female; and 64.9% had &gt;12 years of education. Mean (SD) 3MSE and MoCA scores were 86.9 (8.2) and 19.8 (3.8), respectively. 93.5% of the cohort had a &quot;positive&quot; screen on the MoCA, scoring &lt;26 (education-adjusted), compared with 47.5% on the 3MSE (cut-point &lt; 88).

"26585396","Stroke Location Is an Independent Predictor of Cognitive Outcome.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: On top of functional outcome, accurate prediction of cognitive outcome for stroke patients is an unmet need with major implications for clinical management. We investigated whether stroke location may contribute independent prognostic value to multifactorial predictive models of functional and cognitive outcomes.METHODS: Four hundred twenty-eight consecutive patients with ischemic stroke were prospectively assessed with magnetic resonance imaging at 24 to 72 hours and at 3 months for functional outcome using the modified Rankin Scale and cognitive outcome using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Statistical maps of functional and cognitive eloquent regions were derived from the first 215 patients (development sample) using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping. We used multivariate logistic regression models to study the influence of stroke location (number of eloquent voxels from voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping maps), age, initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and stroke volume on modified Rankin Scale and MoCA. The second part of our cohort was used as an independent replication sample.RESULTS: In univariate analyses, stroke location, age, initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and stroke volume were all predictive of poor modified Rankin Scale and MoCA. In multivariable analyses, stroke location remained the strongest independent predictor of MoCA and significantly improved the prediction compared with using only age, initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and stroke volume (area under the curve increased from 0.697-0.771; difference=0.073; 95% confidence interval, 0.008-0.155). In contrast, stroke location did not persist as independent predictor of modified Rankin Scale that was mainly driven by initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (area under the curve going from 0.840 to 0.835). Similar results were obtained in the replication sample.CONCLUSIONS: Stroke location is an independent predictor of cognitive outcome (MoCA) at 3 months post stroke."

Data of biochemical parameters and biomarkers were collected.RESULTS: Serum AGEs, RAGE, and CRP levels were significantly increased in MCI patients compared to controls. In group of patients with MCI, serum RAGE level was positively correlated with AGEs level and with CRP level. RAGE, AGEs, and CRP concentrations were positively correlated with HbA1c levels and negatively correlated with MoCA score. The univariate logistic regression models revealed that variables, which increased the likelihood of diagnosis of MCI in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes were higher levels of HbA1c, RAGE, AGEs, CRP, TG, lower level of HDL cholesterol, previous CVD, HA, or use of HA drugs, hyperlipidemia, retinopathy, nephropathy, increased number of co-morbidities, older age, and less years of formal education. HA or use of HA drugs, previous CVD, higher level of RAGE and CRP, older age and less years of formal education are the factors increasing the likelihood of having MCI in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes in multivariable model.CONCLUSION: In summary, serum AGEs, RAGE, and CRP are increased in the circulation of MCI elderly diabetic patients compared to controls. A larger population-based prospective study needs to be performed to further confirm the relationship between AGEs, RAGE, and the cognitive decline or progress to dementia."
"26566043","Blood Biomarkers Associated with Cognitive Decline in Early Stage and Drug-Naive Parkinson's Disease Patients.","Early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) continues to be a major challenge in the field. The lack of a robust biomarker to detect early stage PD patients has considerably slowed the progress toward the development of potential therapeutic agents. We have previously evaluated several RNA biomarkers in whole blood from participants enrolled in two independent clinical studies. In these studies, PD patients were medicated, thus, expression of these biomarkers in de novo patients remains unknown. To this end, we tested ten RNA biomarkers in blood samples from 99 untreated PD patients and 101 HC nested in the cross-sectional Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative by quantitative real-time PCR. One biomarker out of ten, COPZ1 trended toward significance (nominal p = 0.009) when adjusting for age, sex, and educational level. Further, COPZ1, EFTUD2 and PTBP1 mRNAs correlated with clinical features in PD patients including the Hoehn and Yahr scale, Movement Disorder Society revision of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score. Levels of EFTUD2 and PTBP1 were significantly higher in cognitively normal PD patients (PD-CN) compared to cognitively impaired PD patients (PD-MCI). Interestingly, blood glucose levels were significantly higher in PD and PD-MCI patients (= 100 mg/dL, pre-diabetes) compared to HC. Collectively, we report the association of three RNA biomarkers, COPZ1, EFTUD2 and PTBP1 with clinical features including cognitive decline in early drug-naïve PD patients. Further, our results show that drug-naïve PD and PD-MCI patients have glucose levels characteristic of pre-diabetes patients, suggesting that impaired glucose metabolism is an early event in PD. Evaluation of these potential biomarkers in a larger longitudinal study is warranted. "

"26530222","Relationship between glycated hemoglobin A1c and cognitive function in nondemented elderly patients with type 2 diabetes.","Elderly patients with type 2 diabetes are at a greater risk for cognitive decline. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between the degree of hyperglycemia and cognitive status in nondemented, elderly diabetics. Between Jan 2013 and Dec 2014, 1174 geriatric patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in the study (579 males; age = 60 years; from Fuzhou, Fujian, China). Cognitive function was measured with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). A statistically significant, age-adjusted association was observed between the A1C levels and the scores on two cognitive tests (MMSE and MoCA). Specifically, a 1% higher A1C value was associated with a 0.21-point lower MMSE score (95% CI; compare -0.11 to -0.28; P &lt; 0.0001), as well as a 0.11-point lower MoCA score (95% CI; compare -0.10 to -0.38; P &lt; 0.0001). Higher A1C levels were not significantly associated with lower MMSE and MoCA test scores after adjusting for all variables. No significant correlation was found between the two variables in patients older than 80 years of age (n = 215; OR = 1.019; 95% CI = 0.968 - 1.099; p = 0.251). Evidence strongly suggests that chronic hyperglycemia is associated with a decline in cognitive function in nondemented elderly patients with type 2 diabetes. When cognitive assessments are made, comprehensive factors such as advanced age, education level, duration of diabetes, hypertension and other vascular risks should be taken into account. For older geriatric patients (age = 80 years), there is no significant correlation between A1c levels and cognitive function."
"26511789","Microstructural white matter changes mediate age-related cognitive decline on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).","Although the relationship between aging and cognitive decline is well established, there is substantial individual variability in the degree of cognitive decline in older adults. The present study investigates whether variability in cognitive performance in community-dwelling older adults is related to the presence of whole brain or tract-specific changes in white matter microstructure. Specifically, we examine whether age-related decline in performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a cognitive screening tool, is mediated by the white matter microstructural decline. We also examine if this relationship is driven by the presence of cardiovascular risk factors or variability in cerebral arterial pulsatility, an index of cardiovascular risk. Sixty-nine participants (aged 43-87) completed behavioral and MRI testing including T1 structural, T2-weighted FLAIR, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences. Measures of white matter microstructure were calculated using diffusion tensor imaging analyses on the DWI sequence. Multiple linear regression revealed that MoCA scores were predicted by radial diffusivity (RaD) of white matter beyond age or other cerebral measures. While increasing age and arterial pulsatility were associated with increasing RaD, these factors did not mediate the relationship between total white matter RaD and MoCA. Further, the relationship between MoCA and RaD was specific to participants who reported at least one cardiovascular risk factor. These findings highlight the importance of cardiovascular risk factors in the presentation of cognitive decline in old age. Further work is needed to establish whether medical or lifestyle management of these risk factors can prevent or reverse cognitive decline in old age. "

Using the ELISA method, we found that the mean concentrations of both APL1ß28 and clusterin were not significantly different between the control and aMCI groups. The APL1ß28 levels were positively correlated with clusterin and that both were negatively correlated with the MMSE scores of the aMCI patients. Clusterin levels were negatively correlated with the MoCA and CASI scores of the aMCI patients. Using multivariate analysis, the correlation between clusterin and MMSE/MoCA/CASI was independent of other AD risk factors including age, education, sex, body mass index and ApoE genotype. The data presented here demonstrate that plasma clusterin levels reflect cognitive function in aMCI patients. "
"26503296","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment: Creating a Crosswalk with the Mini-Mental State Examination.","OBJECTIVES: To establish Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores that correspond to well-established cut-points on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study.SETTING: General medical service of a large teaching hospital.PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 75 and older (N = 199; mean age 84, 63% female).MEASUREMENTS: The MoCA (range 0-30) and the MMSE (range 0-30) were administered within 2 hours of each other. The Abbreviated MoCA (A-MoCA; range 0-22) was calculated from the full MoCA. Scores from the three tests were analyzed using equipercentile equating, a statistical method for determining comparable scores on different tests of a similar construct by estimating percentile equivalents.RESULTS: MoCA scores were lower (mean 19.3 ± 5.8) than MMSE scored (mean 24.1 ± 6.6). Traditional MMSE cut-points of 27 for mild cognitive impairment and 23 for dementia corresponded to MoCA scores of 23 and 17, respectively.CONCLUSION: Scores on the full and abbreviated versions of the MoCA can be linked directly to the MMSE. The MoCA may be more sensitive to changes in cognitive performance at higher levels of functioning."
"26499758","Association of type 2 diabetes GWAS loci and the risk of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.","BACKGROUND: Insulin and insulin-like growth factor contribute to normal brain function. Recent experimental and clinical studies showed that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Parkinson's disease (PD) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) share several dysregulated pathways.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether genome-wide significant loci of T2DM are associated with the risk of PD and AD as well as the severity of cognitive impairment.METHODS: Study subjects were 500 PD patients, 400 AD patients, and 500 unrelated controls. We selected 32 genetic variants from 11 genes (CDC123, CDKAL1, CDKN2B, FTO, GLIS3, HHEX, IGF2BP2, KCNJ11, KCNQ1, SLC30A8, and TCF7L2) and intergenic regions based on results of recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in T2DM. These variants were reported to be T2DM-susceptibility loci and have been replicated in other independent studies. All association analyses were performed using logistic regression models, adjusting for age and sex.RESULTS: KCNQ1 SNP rs163182 showed the strongest association with AD, but it was not significant after Bonferroni correction (OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.07-1.59, Pcorrected = 0.32). In PD patients, CDC123 SNP rs11257655 showed modest association with MMSE score &lt;26, and CDKN2B SNPs (rs2383208, rs10965250, and rs10811661) showed modest association with MoCA score &lt;26, which were not significant after Bonferroni correction. Other genetic variants had no association with the risk of PD or AD and the severity of cognitive impairment.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that genome-wide significant loci of T2DM play no major role in the risk and cognitive impairment of PD and AD."
"26498590","Impact of cognitive function on communication in patients  with primary or secondary brain tumours.","Communication support tools (CST) improve patient outcomes in oncology including: knowledge, satisfaction, self-management, and adherence to planned treatment. Little is known about communication support tools use in patients with primary or secondary brain tumours. We aimed to explore cognitive function and communication support tool use in this population. This prospective survey involved patients, caregivers and health professionals. Questionnaires were completed after initial brain radiotherapy consultation and 1-2 weeks later. Patients completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Descriptive statistics are reported. Fifty-three patients participated, median age 62 years, ECOG status 0-2 (90 %), with 75 % having secondary brain metastasis. 21/53 (40 %) patients reported needing help reading medical information. Only 28 % patients had normal cognition (MoCA score = 26/30). Initially, 82 % of patients and 87 % of caregivers reported the consultation was 'extremely/quite clear, and 69 % of their health professionals thought consultation 'extremely/quite clear' to patient. At follow-up, fewer patients (75 %) reported health professionals' explanation as 'extremely/quite clear'. Although patients recalled discussed illness and treatment details, 82 % recalled treatment-related side effects and management thereof by 46 %. CST use was reported by 22 % patients, 19 % caregivers, and 27 %health professionals. When used, tools improved understanding according to 92 % patients, 100 % caregivers, and 91 % health professionals. The majority of patients have some level of cognitive impairment. Information discussed appears clear to most patients, but this is not sustained, and recall of treatment toxicity management is poor. Few CSTs are used in consultations, but when used, are reported as helpful by all."
"26496878","Festination in Chinese patients with Parkinson's disease.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the occurrence and clinical associations of festination in Chinese patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).METHODS: A total of 480 PD patients were recruited in this cross-sectional study. Assessments scales included the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III, PD Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39), Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), frontal assessment battery (FAB), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA).RESULTS: One hundred and forty PD patients (29.2%) reported festination. Festination occurred more frequently in patients with lower limbs as the site of onset and patients with longer disease duration or higher Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;Y) stage (P&lt;0.05). The mean age, levodopa and entacapone use, incidences of motor complications, falls and freezing of gait, and the scores for the UPDRS part III, NMSS, HAMD and HAMA were higher in patients with festination than those without festination (P&lt;0.05). There were no differences in the scores for the PDQ-39, MMSE, FAB and MoCA between the patients with and without festination. The binary logistic regression model indicated that UPDRS part III, lower limbs as the site of onset, freezing of gait and falls were associated with festination.CONCLUSIONS: Festination is a relatively common disabling symptom in Chinese PD patients. Patients with lower limbs as the site of onset and more severe disability were more likely to experience festination. Festination in PD is not related to non-motor symptoms and cognitive dysfunction."
"26491279","Assessment of cognitive impairment in long-term oxygen therapy-dependent COPD patients.","BACKGROUND: A number of studies have shown that COPD, particularly in its later and more severe stages, is associated with various cognitive deficits. Thus, the primary goal of the present study was to elucidate the extent of cognitive impairment in patients with long-term oxygen therapy-dependent (LTOTD) COPD. In addition, this study aimed to determine the effectiveness of two cognitive screening tests, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), for COPD patients and the ability of oxygen therapy to mitigate COPD-related deficits in cognitive function.METHODS: The present study enrolled 45 subjects: 24 nonuser and 21 regular-user LTOTD-COPD patients. All subjects had a similar grade of education, and there were no significant differences regarding age or sex. The MoCA (cutoff: &lt;26 points) and MMSE (cutoff: =24 points) scores were compared between these two groups.RESULTS: The nonuser LTOTD-COPD group had a significantly lower MoCA score than that of the regular-user LTOTD-COPD group (19.38±2.99 vs 21.68±2.14, respectively) as well as a significantly lower MMSE score. Moreover, the absence of supplemental oxygen therapy increased the risk of cognitive impairment (MoCA, P=0.007 and MMSE, P=0.014), and the MoCA and MMSE scores significantly correlated with the number of emergency admissions and the number of hospitalizations in the last year.CONCLUSION: In the present study, the nonuser LTOTD-COPD group exhibited a significant decrease in cognitive status compared with the regular-user LTOTD-COPD group. This suggests that the assessment of cognitive function in nonuser LTOTD-COPD patients and the use of protective strategies, such as continuous supplemental oxygen treatment, should be considered during the management of COPD in this population. In addition, the MoCA score was superior to the MMSE score for the determination of cognitive impairment in the nonuser LTOTD-COPD patients."
"26484925","Sensitivity of Neuropsychological Tests to Identify Cognitive Decline in Highly Educated Elderly Individuals: 12 Months Follow up.","Highly educated individuals have a lower risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). A common assumption is that their &quot;cognitive reserve&quot; protects them from cognitive decline and postpones the clinical manifestation of dementia. These highly educated individuals usually obtain normal scores on cognitive screening tests, although at the same time they can experience subjective cognitive decline and difficulty in multiple cognitive domains. Although comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations usually identify subtle changes in cognition, they demand extensive resources and thus are expensive and difficult to obtain. Therefore, lack of sensitivity of screening tests on the one hand, along with difficulty to acquire a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation on the other hand, impede identification of cognitive decline at its earliest stages in this special population. Accordingly, this study aims to identify which neuropsychological tests have the highest sensitivity to detect the earliest stages of cognitive decline among highly educated elderly [n<U+200A>=<U+200A>27, ages 66-80 (mean<U+200A>=<U+200A>72.6 SD<U+200A>=<U+200A>4.54), mean education level<U+200A>=<U+200A>17.14 (SD<U+200A>=<U+200A>3.21 range: 12-24 years)]. Baseline scores and scores at one-year follow up were obtained. We also conducted MRI scans to characterize the relation between brain volume and cognitive performance. Results show significant reductions in RVALT, Semantic verbal Fluency, ROCF copy, and MoCA scores whereas PF, TMT, ROCF delay, digit span, and knowledge tests were not significant. The study stresses the importance of using sensitive neuropsychological tests to examine this special population and the need to create norms that combine an individual's education with age. "
"26470772","Montreal Cognitive Assessment: One Cutoff Never Fits All.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to examine the discrepancy between single versus age and education corrected cutoff scores in classifying performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack.METHODS: MoCA norms were collected from 794 functionally independent and stroke- and dementia-free persons aged =65 years. magnetic resonance imaging was used to exclude healthy controls with significant brain pathology and medial temporal lobe atrophy. Cutoff scores at 16th, 7th, and 2nd percentiles by age and education were derived for the MoCA and MoCA 5-minute Protocol. MoCA performance in 919 patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack was classified using the single and norm-derived cutoff scores.RESULTS: The norms for the Hong Kong version of the MoCA total and domain scores and the total score of the MoCA 5-minute protocol are described. Only 65.1% and 25.7% healthy controls and 45.2% and 19.0% patients scored above the conventional cutoff scores of 21/22 and 25/26 on the MoCA. Using classification with norm-derived cutoff scores as reference, locally derived cutoff score of 21/22 yielded a classification discrepancy of =42.4%. Discrepancy increased with higher age and lower education level, with the majority being false positives by single cutoffs. With the 25/26 cutoff of the original MoCA, discrepancy further increased to =74.3%.CONCLUSIONS: Conventional single cutoff scores are associated with substantially high rates of misclassification especially in older and less-educated patients with stroke. These results caution against the use of one-size-fits-all cutoffs on the MoCA."
"26464420","Routine cognitive screening in older patients admitted to acute medicine: abbreviated mental test score (AMTS) and subjective memory complaint versus Montreal Cognitive Assessment and IQCODE.","INTRODUCTION: Routine cognitive screening for in-patients aged =75 years is recommended, but there is uncertainty around how this should be operationalised. We therefore determined the feasibility and reliability of the Abbreviated mental test score (AMTS/10) and its relationship to subjective memory complaint, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA/30) and informant report in unselected older admissions.METHODS: Consecutive acute general medicine patients aged =75 years admitted over 10 weeks (March-May 2013) had AMTS and a question regarding subjective memory complaint (if no known dementia/delirium). At =72 h, the 30-point Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) were done. Cognitive impairment was defined as AMTS &lt; 9 or MoCA &lt; 26 (mild impairment) and MoCA &lt; 20 (moderate/severe impairment) or IQCODE = 3.6.RESULTS: Among 264 patients (mean age/SD = 84.3/5.6 years, 117 (44%) male), 228 (86%) were testable with AMTS. 49/50 (98%) testable patients with dementia/delirium had low AMTS compared with 79/199 (44%) of those without (P &lt; 0.001). Subjective memory complaint agreed poorly with objective cognitive deficit (39% denying a memory problem had AMTS &lt; 9 (kappa = 0.134, P = 0.086)) as did informant report (kappa = 0.18, P = 0.15). In contrast, correlation between AMTS and MoCA was strong (R2 = 0.59, P &lt; 0.001) with good agreement between AMTS &lt; 9 and MoCA &lt; 20 (kappa = 0.50, P &lt; 0.01), although 85% of patients with normal AMTS had MoCA &lt; 26.CONCLUSIONS: The AMTS was feasible and valid in older acute medicine patients agreeing well with the MoCA albeit with a ceiling effect. Objective cognitive deficits were prevalent in patients without known dementia or delirium but were not reliably identified by subjective cognitive complaint or informant report."
"26461878","What are the correlates of cognition and participation to return to work after first ever mild stroke?","BACKGROUND: The percentage of working age people with mild stroke has risen. Evidence indicates that even mild stroke impact cognition, executive functioning, and daily functioning, consequently affecting participation, quality of life (QoL) and return to work (RTW).OBJECTIVES: (1) Compare cognition, participation and QoL between people 3 months post-mild stroke who RTW and those who did not; and (2) To determine the correlates of these variables to RTW of participants 3 months post-stroke.METHODS: We visited at home 163 stroke survivors (117 men, 46 women) 3 months post-mild stroke ranging from 50 to 89 years. Participants who returned to work (n = 114) and those who did not (n = 49). Data collection at home included measures for cognitive status (MoCA), executive functions (EFPT, DEX), depression (GDS), participation (RNL), and QoL (SIS recovery).RESULTS: Significant differences were found between RTW participants and those who did not RTW in measures of cognition, depression, participation and QoL (t<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.36 to -<U+2009>5.62, P &lt; 0.022-0.001).

"26459220","Exploring the effects of coexisting amyloid in subcortical vascular cognitive impairment.","BACKGROUND: Mixed pathology, particularly Alzheimer's disease with cerebrovascular lesions, is reported as the second most common cause of dementia. Research on mixed dementia typically includes people with a primary AD diagnosis and hence, little is known about the effects of co-existing amyloid pathology in people with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). The purpose of this study was to understand whether individual differences in amyloid pathology might explain variations in cognitive impairment among individuals with clinical subcortical VCI (SVCI).METHODS: Twenty-two participants with SVCI completed an (11)C Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) position emission tomography (PET) scan to quantify global amyloid deposition. Cognitive function was measured using: 1) MOCA; 2) ADAS-Cog; 3) EXIT-25; and 4) specific executive processes including a) Digits Forward and Backwards Test, b) Stroop-Colour Word Test, and c) Trail Making Test. To assess the effect of amyloid deposition on cognitive function we conducted Pearson bivariate correlations to determine which cognitive measures to include in our regression models. Cognitive variables that were significantly correlated with PIB retention values were entered in a hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis to determine the unique effect of amyloid on cognitive function. We controlled for age, education, and ApoE e4 status.RESULTS: Bivariate correlation results showed that PIB binding was significantly correlated with ADAS-Cog (p &lt; 0.01) and MOCA (p &lt; 0.01); increased PIB binding was associated with worse cognitive function on both cognitive measures. PIB binding was not significantly correlated with the EXIT-25 or with specific executive processes (p &gt; 0.05). Regression analyses controlling for age, education, and ApoE e4 status indicated an independent association between PIB retention and the ADAS-Cog (adjusted R-square change of 15.0%, Sig F Change = 0.03). PIB retention was also independently associated with MOCA scores (adjusted R-Square Change of 27.0%, Sig F Change = 0.02).CONCLUSION: We found that increased global amyloid deposition was significantly associated with greater memory and executive dysfunctions as measured by the ADAS-Cog and MOCA. Our findings point to the important role of co-existing amyloid deposition for cognitive function in those with a primary SVCI diagnosis. As such, therapeutic approaches targeting SVCI must consider the potential role of amyloid for the optimal care of those with mixed dementia.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01027858."
"26450414","Cognitive assessment tools in Asia: a systematic review.","BACKGROUND: The prevalence of dementia is increasing in Asia than in any other continent. However, the applicability of the existing cognitive assessment tools is limited by differences in educational and cultural factors in this setting. We conducted a systematic review of published studies on cognitive assessments tools in Asia. We aimed to rationalize the results of available studies which evaluated the validity of cognitive tools for the detection of cognitive impairment and to identify the issues surrounding the available cognitive impairment screening tools in Asia.METHODS: Five electronic databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Science Direct) were searched using the keywords dementia Or Alzheimer Or cognitive impairment And screen Or measure Or test Or tool Or instrument Or assessment, and 2,381 articles were obtained.RESULTS: Thirty-eight articles, evaluating 28 tools in seven Asian languages, were included. Twenty-nine (76%) of the studies had been conducted in East Asia with only four studies conducted in South Asia and no study from northern, western, or central Asia or Indochina. Local language translations of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were assessed in 15 and six studies respectively. Only three tools (the Korean Dementia Screening Questionnaire, the Picture-based Memory Intelligence Scale, and the revised Hasegawa Dementia Screen) were derived de novo from Asian populations. These tools were assessed in five studies. Highly variable cut-offs were reported for the MMSE (17-29/30) and MoCA (21-26/30), with 13/19 (68%) of studies reporting educational bias.CONCLUSIONS: Few cognitive assessment tools have been validated in Asia, with no published validation studies for many Asian nations and languages. In addition, many available tools display educational bias. Future research should include concerted efforts to develop culturally appropriate tools with minimal educational bias."
"26449355","Cognitive status is a determinant of health resource utilization among individuals with a history of falls: a 12-month prospective cohort study.","SUMMARY: Falls are a costly public health problem worldwide. The literature is devoid of prospective data that identifies factors among fallers that significantly drive health care resource utilization. We found that cognitive function--specifically, executive functions--and cognitive status are significant determinants of health resource utilization among older fallers.INTRODUCTION: Although falls are costly, there are no prospective data examining factors among fallers that drive health care resource utilization. We identified key determinants of health resource utilization (HRU) at 6 and 12 months among older adults with a history of falls. Specifically, with the increasing recognition that cognitive impairment is associated with increased falls risk, we investigated cognition as a potential driver of health resource utilization.METHODS: This 12-month prospective cohort study at the Vancouver Falls Prevention Clinic (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>319) included participants with a history of at least one fall in the previous 12 months. Based on their cognitive status, participants were divided into two groups: (1) no mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and (2) MCI. We constructed two linear regression models with HRU at 6 and 12 months as the dependent variables for each model, respectively. Predictors relating to mobility, global cognition, executive functions, and cognitive status (MCI versus no MCI) were examined. Age, sex, comorbidities, depression status, and activities of daily living were included regardless of statistical significance.RESULTS: Global cognition, comorbidities, working memory, and cognitive status (MCI versus no MCI ascertained using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)) were significant determinants of total HRU at 6 months. The number of medical comorbidities and global cognition were significant determinants of total HRU at 12 months.CONCLUSION: MCI status was a determinant of HRU at 6 months among older adults with a history of falls. As such, efforts to minimize health care resource use related to falls, it is important to tailor future interventions to be effective for people with MCI who fall.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01022866."

However, its clinical utility for dementia case finding at the forefront of dementia management, primary healthcare, is unknown. Therefore, we recruited participants from two primary healthcare centers in Singapore and measured their performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and a local formal neuropsychological battery, in addition to the AD8. Logistic regression was conducted to examine the associations between demographic factors and dementia. Area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was used to establish the optimal cut-off points for dementia case finding. Of the 309 participants recruited, 243 (78.7%) had CDR<U+200A>=<U+200A>0, 22 (7.1%) CDR<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.5, and 44 (14.2%) CDR =1. Age was strongly associated with dementia, and the optimal age for dementia case finding in primary healthcare settings was =75 years. In this age group, the AD8 has excellent dementia case finding capability and was superior to the MMSE and equivalent to the MoCA [AD8 AUC (95% CI): 0.95 (0.91-0.99), cut-off: =3, sensitivity: 0.90, specificity: 0.88, PPV: 0.79 and NPV: 0.94; MMSE AUC (95% CI): 0.87 (0.79-0.94), p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.04; MoCA AUC (95% CI): 0.88 (0.82-0.95), p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.06].

"26413475","Structural and physiological MRI correlates of occult cerebrovascular disease in late-onset epilepsy.","Late-onset epilepsy (LOE), with onset after 50 years of age, is often attributed to underlying occult cerebrovascular disease. LOE is associated with a three-fold increase in subsequent stroke risk, therefore it is important to improve our understanding of pathophysiology. In this exploratory study, we aimed to determine whether established structural magnetic resonance imaging markers and novel physiological imaging markers of occult cerebrovascular disease were more common in patients with LOE than age-matched controls. Sixteen patients with LOE (mean age ± SD: 67.6 ± 6.5 years) and 15 age-matched control subjects (mean age: 65.1 ± 3.9 years) underwent a 3 T MRI scan protocol. T1-weighted images and T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images were used to determine cortical grey matter volume and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume respectively, whilst multiple delay time arterial spin labelling (ASL) images were collected at rest and during a hypercapnic challenge. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and arterial arrival time (AAT) were calculated from ASL data under both normocapnic and hypercapnic conditions. Cerebrovascular reactivity was also calculated for both CBF and AAT relative to the change in end-tidal CO2. Patients with LOE were found to have significantly lower cortical volume than control subjects (33.8 ± 3.8% of intracranial volume vs. 38.0 ± 5.5%, p = 0.02) and significantly higher WMH volume (1339 ± 1408 mm3 vs. 514 ± 481 mm3, p = 0.047). Baseline whole brain AAT was found to be significantly prolonged in patients with LOE in comparison to control subjects (1539 ± 129 ms vs. 1363 ± 167 ms, p = 0.005). Voxel-based analysis showed the significant prolongation of AAT to be predominantly distributed in the frontal and temporal lobes. Voxel-based morphometry showed the lower cortical volume to be localised primarily to temporal lobes. No significant differences in CBF or cerebrovascular reactivity were found between the two groups. Baseline whole brain AAT and cortical volume differences persisted upon further analysis to take account of differences in smoking history between patients and control subjects. These findings suggest that occult cerebrovascular disease is relevant to the pathophysiology of LOE."

However, distance or disability could prevent such individuals from participating in traditional, clinic-based research at major centers.OBJECTIVE: Use videoconferencing to connect participants to specialists to: (1) demonstrate feasibility of virtual research visits within this population (2) collect phenotypic data of the participants, (3) validate self-reported diagnosis, and (4) gauge interest in virtual research visits.METHODS: We solicited volunteers throughout the United States through Fox Trial Finder. Interested individuals with PD provided consent, were given web cameras if needed, completed baseline surveys, and downloaded videoconferencing software remotely. Participants had a test connection and assessment appointment which included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), then a virtual research visit with a neurologist who reviewed their history and assessed their PD using a modified Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Neurologists assessed PD diagnosis and symptomatology. Physicians and participants were surveyed about their experience.RESULTS: Of 204 individuals who consented, 166 (81% ) individuals from 39 states completed all visits. The mean age was 62 and mean disease duration was 8.0 years. Mean MoCA score was 26.5, and mean modified MDS-UPDRS motor score was 22.8 (out of a possible 124). Neurologists judged PD as the most likely diagnosis in 97% of cases. Overall satisfaction with the visits was 79% (satisfied or very satisfied) among neurologists and 93% among participants.CONCLUSIONS: Through virtual research visits, neurologists engaged, characterized, and validated self-reported diagnosis in individuals with PD over a broad geography. This model may facilitate future research participation."
"26401443","APOE genotype and age modifies the correlation between cognitive status and metabolites from hippocampus by a 2D (1)H-MRS in non-demented elders.","Purpose. To examine the associations among age, Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, metabolic changes in the hippocampus detected by 2D (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and neuropsychological measures of cognition in non-demented elders. Materials and Methods. We studied a cohort of 16 cognitively normal controls (CN) and 11 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients between 66 and 88 years old who were genotyped for APOE genetic polymorphism. Measurements of 2D(1)H-MRS metabolites were obtained in the hippocampus region. Adjusting by age among all subjects, the association between metabolic changes and cognitive function was measured by Spearman partial rank-order correlation. The effect of APOE status was measured by separating the subjects into APOE genotype subgroups, including the APOEe4 carriers and APOEe4 non-carriers. Results. In contrast to the CN group matched with age, gender, and education, aMCI patients showed increased myo-inositol (mI)/Creatine (Cr) ratio only in the right hippocampus. No differences were noted on N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/Cr and mI/NAA from bilateral hippocampus, and so was mI/Cr ratio in left hippocampus between aMCI and CN. The mI/Cr ratio from the right hippocampus in non-demented elders was negatively correlated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores. Whether e4 genotype or age was added as a covariate, none of the correlation effects remained significant. Additionally, adjusting for age and APOE genotype together, there was no significant correlation between them. Conclusion. Since the higher mI/Cr from the right hippocampus of the patients with aMCI than those from CN, the mI/Cr could be a more specific predictor of general cognitive function in aMCI patients. There is an association between higher mI/Cr in right hippocampus and worse cognitive function for the non-demented older adults, and the correlation could be modified by APOE status and age.

This study sought to understand the relationship of comprehensively measured cognitive function with COPD severity, quality of life, living situation, health care utilization, and self-management abilities.METHODS: Subjects with COPD were recruited from the outpatient pulmonary clinic. Cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA). Self-management abilities were measured using the Self Management Ability Score 30. Quality of life was measured using the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire. Pearson correlation was used to assess the bivariate association of the MOCA with other study measures. Multivariate analysis was completed to understand the interaction of the MOCA and living situation on COPD outcomes of hospitalization, quality of life, and self-management ability.RESULTS: This study included 100 participants of mean age 70±9.4 years (63% male, 37% female) with COPD (mean FEV1 [forced expiratory volume in 1 second] percentage predicted 40.4±16.7). Mean MOCA score was 23.8±3.9 with 63% of patients having mild cognitive impairment. The MOCA was negatively correlated with age (r=-0.28, P=0.005) and positively correlated with education (r=+0.24, P=0.012). There was no significant correlation between cognitive function and exacerbations, emergency room (ER) visits, or hospitalizations. There was no association between the MOCA score and self-management abilities or quality of life. We tested the interaction of living situation and the MOCA with self-management abilities and found statistical significance (P=0.017), indicating that individuals living alone with higher cognitive function report lower self-management abilities.CONCLUSION: Cognitive impairment in COPD does not appear to be meaningfully associated with COPD severity, health outcomes, or self-management abilities. The routine screening for cognitive impairment due to a diagnosis of COPD may not be indicated. Living alone significantly affects the interaction between self-management abilities and cognitive function."
"26380951","Striatal and Cortical ß-Amyloidopathy and Cognition in Parkinson's Disease.","INTRODUCTION: Although most previous cognitive studies of ß-amyloidopathy in PD focused on cortical plaque deposition, recent postmortem studies point to an important role of striatal ß-amyloid plaque deposition. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative contributions of striatal and cortical ß-amyloidopathy to cognitive impairment in PD.METHODS: Patients with PD (n = 62; age, 68.9 ± 6.4 years; H &amp; Y stage: 2.7 ± 0.5; MoCA score: 25.2 ± 3.0) underwent [(11) C]Pittsburgh compound B ß-amyloid, [(11) C]dihydrotetrabenazine monoaminergic, and [(11) C]methyl-4-piperidinyl propionate acetylcholinesterase brain PET imaging and neuropsychological assessment. [(11) C]Pittsburgh compound B ß-amyloid data from young to middle-aged healthy subjects were used to define elevated [(11) C]Pittsburgh compound B binding in patients.RESULTS: Elevated cortical and striatal ß-amyloid deposition were present in 37% and 16%, respectively, of this predominantly nondemented cohort of patients with PD. Increased striatal ß-amyloid deposition occurred in half of all subjects with increased cortical ß-amyloid deposition. In contrast, increased striatal ß-amyloid deposition did not occur in the absence of increased cortical ß-amyloid deposition. Analysis of covariance using global composite cognitive z scores as the outcome parameter showed significant regressor effects for combined striatal and cortical ß-amyloidopathy (F = 4.18; P = 0.02) after adjusting for covariate effects of cortical cholinergic activity (F = 5.67; P = 0.02), caudate nucleus monoaminergic binding, duration of disease, and age (total model: F = 3.55; P = 0.0048). Post-hoc analysis showed significantly lower cognitive z score for combined striatal and cortical ß-amyloidopathy, compared to cortical-only ß-amyloidopathy and non-ß-amyloidopathy subgroups.CONCLUSIONS: The combined presence of striatal and cortical ß-amyloidopathy is associated with greater cognitive impairment than cortical ß-amyloidopathy alone in PD."
"26338988","Resilience and MRI correlates of cognitive impairment in community-dwelling elders.","BACKGROUND: The contribution of education and intelligence to resilience against age-related cognitive decline is not clear, particularly in the presence of 'normal for age' minor brain abnormalities.METHOD: Participants (n = 208, mean age 69.2 years, s.d. = 5.4) in the Whitehall II imaging substudy attended for neuropsychological testing and multisequence 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging. Images were independently rated by three trained clinicians for global and hippocampal atrophy, periventricular and deep white matter changes.RESULTS: Although none of the participants qualified for a clinical diagnosis of dementia, a screen for cognitive impairment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) &lt;26) was abnormal in 22%. Hippocampal atrophy, in contrast to other brain measures, was associated with a reduced MoCA score even after controlling for age, gender, socioeconomic status, years of education and premorbid IQ. Premorbid IQ and socioeconomic status were associated with resilience in the presence of hippocampal atrophy.CONCLUSIONS: Independent contributions from a priori risk (age, hippocampal atrophy) and resilience (premorbid function, socioeconomic status) combine to predict measured cognitive impairment."

Only 40% had stable MoCA-J performance; 30% experienced deterioration and 30% improvement. Age increment, hospitalization in previous year, slower Timed Up and Go (TUG) score, and slower maximum walking speed were predictive of subsequent MoCA-J performance deterioration.CONCLUSION: Slower TUG and walking speed performances were independent predictors of short-term MoCA-J deterioration. Research aimed at assessing lower-extremity performance-based tests in MCI-related decision-making is warranted."
"26285662","Cognitive outcome in acute simvastatin treatment for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: A propensity matched analysis.","OBJECTIVES: Experimental evidence has indicated the benefit of simvastatin in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Recently, acute simvastatin treatment was not shown to be beneficial in neurological outcome using modified Rankin Scale. Cognitive function is another important dimension of outcome assessment and yet had not been investigated in statin studies for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. We therefore explored whether acute simvastatin treatment would improve cognitive outcomes.METHODS: The study recruited SAH patients with acute simvastatin treatment enrolled in a randomized controlled double-blinded clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01038193). A control cohort of SAH patients without simvastatin treatment was identified with propensity score matching of age and admission grade. Primary outcome measure was Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Secondary outcome measures were delayed ischaemic deficit (DID), delayed cerebral infarction, modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).RESULTS: Fifty-one SAH patients with acute simvastatin treatment and 51 SAH patients without simvastatin treatment were recruited for analysis. At 3 months, there were no differences in MoCA scores (MoCA: 21+/-6 vs. 21+/-5, p=0.772). MoCA-assessed cognitive impairment (MoCA&lt;26) was not different (75% vs. 80%, OR 0.7, 95%CI 0.3 to 1.8, p=0.477). There were also no differences in DID, delayed cerebral infarction, favorable mRS outcome, and MMSE scores, and MMSE-assessed cognitive impairment between both groups.CONCLUSIONS: The current study does not support that acute simvastatin treatment improves cognitive outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage."
"26271049","Intellectual and physical activities, but not social activities, are associated with better global cognition: a multi-site evaluation of the cognition and lifestyle activity study for seniors in Asia (CLASSA).","BACKGROUND: population ageing will lead to a leap in the dementia population in Asia. However, information about potentials for low-cost and low-risk interventions is limited.OBJECTIVES: to study the associations between lifestyle activities and global cognition from the Cognitive and Lifestyle Activity Study for Seniors in Asia (CLASSA).DESIGN: a cross-sectional study.METHODOLOGY: we studied the association between global cognition and lifestyle activity participation in community living older adults (60 years or over) across nine sites in East Asia. A standardised lifestyle activity questionnaire exploring activities from four categories (intellectual, physical, social and recreational) was used to measure the pattern. Global cognition was categorised by locally validated versions of Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (good cognition, GC-scored at the top 25% among participants with no significant cognitive deficit (SCD); normal cognition, NC-middle 50% among participants with no SCD; mild cognitive deficit, MCD-lowest 25% among participants with no SCD; SCD-below local cut-offs for dementia).RESULTS: two thousand four hundred and four (1,009 men; 1,395 women) participants were recruited. The mean age was 71.0 (7.2) years. A higher variety of intellectual and physical activities were associated with GC; more social activities were associated with higher risks of having impaired cognition (multinomial logistic regression). The same association was found in participants with no SCD and had regular activities for over 10 years (n = 574).CONCLUSION: intellectual activity and physical exercise were associated with better cognitive states in Asian older adults. Community-based intervention may take considerations into specific types of activities to optimise cognition."
"26251108","Strengths and Limitations of the MoCA for Assessing Cognitive Functioning: Findings From a Large Representative Sample of Irish Older Adults.","BACKGROUND: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a very widely used test for mild cognitive impairment. Differing recommendations have been made regarding its utility in providing a profile of performance across several cognitive domains.OBJECTIVES: To examine the factor structure of the MoCA in a nationally representative population study of older Irish adults and evaluate its utility in providing domain-specific information.METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of wave 1 data from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing was undertaken. Data from a subset of 2342 participants assessed using the MoCA were analyzed using both confirmatory factor analytic (CFA) and exploratory factor analytic (EFA) methods.RESULTS: Mean age was 72.64 (range 65 to 98), 53% female. The CFA provided evidence of adequate overall model fit for a previously proposed 6-factor model. In contrast, EFA yielded a 3-factor solution and test items cross-loaded onto a number of factors with no clear pattern of underlying cognitive domains. Using EFA to explore the 6-factor model yielded good fit, but again test items cross-loaded onto a number of factors with no clear pattern evident.CONCLUSION: Lack of concordance between the CFA and EFA findings demonstrates that the correspondence between individual tests and their assumed cognitive domains is not robust, reflecting at least in part a current lack of consensus on how core cognitive constructs are defined and on what subcomponents can be subsumed under different cognitive domains. The MoCA should not be viewed as a substitute for more in-depth neuropsychological assessment when domain-specific information is required."

"26218598","Cardiovascular Risk Factors Associated with Smaller Brain Volumes in Regions Identified as Early Predictors of Cognitive Decline.","PURPOSE: To determine in a large multiethnic cohort the cardiovascular and genetic risk factors associated with smaller volume in the hippocampus, precuneus, and posterior cingulate, and their association with preclinical deficits in cognitive performance in patients younger and older than 50 years.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved the study and all participants provided written informed consent. Eligible for this study were 1629 participants (700 men and 929 women; mean age, 50.0 years ± 10.2 [standard deviation]) drawn from the population-based Dallas Heart Study who underwent laboratory and clinical analysis in an initial baseline visit and approximately 7 years later underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging with automated volumetry and cognitive assessment with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Regression analysis showed associations between risk factors and segmental volumes, and associations between these volumes with cognitive performance in participants younger and older than 50 years.RESULTS: Lower hippocampal volume was associated with previous alcohol consumption (standardized estimate, -0.04; P = .039) and smoking (standardized estimate, -0.04; P = .048). Several risk factors correlated with lower total brain, posterior cingulate, and precuneus volumes. Higher total (standardized estimate, 0.06; P = .050), high-density lipoprotein (standardized estimate, 0.07; P = .003), and low-density lipoprotein (standardized estimate, 0.04; P = .037) cholesterol levels were associated with larger posterior cingulate volume, and higher triglyceride levels (standardized estimate, 0.06; P = .004) were associated with larger precuneus volume. Total MoCA score was associated with posterior cingulate volume (standardized estimate, 0.13; P = .001) in younger individuals and with hippocampal (standardized estimate, 0.06; P &lt; .05) and precuneus (standardized estimate, 0.08; P &lt; .023) volumes in older adults.CONCLUSION: Smaller volumes in specific brain regions considered to be early markers of dementia risk were associated with specific cardiovascular disease risk factors and cognitive deficits in a predominantly midlife multiethnic population-based sample. Additionally, the risk factors most associated with these brain volumes differed in participants younger and older than 50 years, as did the association between brain volume and MoCA score."
"26169667","Cognitive function and left ventricular assist device implantation.","BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is frequent in patients with heart failure (HF) and can lead to poor quality of life and increased risk of mortality. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a simple screening tool that is sensitive to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and that has been validated in the settings of neurologic and cardiovascular disease. This study determined the extent of cognitive impairment in patients with HF undergoing evaluation for advanced surgical therapy and evaluated changes in MoCA score with follow-up cognitive assessment at 8 months after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation.METHODS: As part of routine assessment for LVAD candidacy, 176 patients with advanced HF were administered the MoCA; 56 patients were reevaluated 8 months after LVAD implantation.RESULTS: Patients with MCI, indicated by MoCA score &lt;26 out of 30, made up 67% of the study cohort. MCI was associated with significantly older age, higher CHADS2 (congestive HF, hypertension, age &gt;75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack) risk score, statin use, history of stroke and hypertension, and reduced serum cholesterol levels. In 56 patients who underwent follow-up evaluation after LVAD implantation, total MoCA score and visuospatial, executive, and delayed recall cognitive domains were significantly improved.CONCLUSIONS: This study assessed the use of the MoCA in patients with end-stage HF being evaluated for advanced surgical therapy. We found the MoCA to be a rapid, simple, and powerful tool for detecting cognitive impairment in these patients. MCI was highly prevalent in the cohort. Significant improvement in overall MoCA score was noted after LVAD implantation."
"26167502","Serum Soluble Adhesion Molecules and Markers of Systemic Inflammation in Elderly Diabetic Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Depressive Symptoms.","The aim of the study was to determine the serum levels of soluble adhesion molecules and hs-CRP in elderly diabetics with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) alone or with depressive symptoms. Methods. 219 diabetics elders were screened for psychiatric disorders and divided: group 1, MCI without depressive mood; group 2, MCI with depressive mood; group 3, controls. Data of biochemical parameters and biomarkers were collected. Results. In groups 1 and 2 levels of all biomarkers were significantly higher as compared to controls. The highest level of hs-CRP and sICAM-1 was detected in group 2. SVCAM-1 and sE-selectin levels were also the highest in group 2; however they did not significantly differ as compared to group 1. MoCA score was negatively correlated with all biomarkers in group 1. The logistic regression model showed that variables which increased the likelihood of having depressive syndrome in MCI patients were older age, stroke, neuropathy, increased number of comorbidities, and higher sICAM-1 level. Conclusions. We first demonstrated that elderly diabetic patients with MCI, particularly those with depressive mood have higher levels of soluble adhesion molecules and markers of low-grade systemic inflammation. Coexisting depressive syndrome in patients with MCI through common inflammatory pathways may result in augmentation of psychiatric disorders. "
"26142897","Mobility and cognition are associated with wellbeing and health related quality of life among older adults: a cross-sectional analysis of the Vancouver Falls Prevention Cohort.","BACKGROUND: Ascertaining individuals' quality of life and wellbeing is essential in public health and clinical research. The impact of these two pressing geriatric syndromes--impaired mobility and cognitive function--on wellbeing and quality of life is not well examined. Hence, our objective was to identify key clinically relevant outcome measures of mobility and cognitive function that explain variation in wellbeing and health related quality of life (HRQoL) among community dwelling older adults.METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 229 participants presenting to the Vancouver Falls Prevention Clinic from June 2010 through October 2013. The linear regression models included two dependent variables: the ICECAP-O assessing wellbeing and the EQ-5D-3L assessing HRQoL. Key independent variables included the Short Performance Physical Battery (SPPB) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Covariates included Functional Comorbidity Index (FCI), sex and age. In the two multiple linear regression models, age was statistically controlled. Other covariates (i.e., sex and FCI) were included based on statistical significance (i.e., p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05).RESULTS: The SPPB was significantly associated with HRQoL and with wellbeing after adjusting for known covariates (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05, Unstandardized ß (Standard Error) 0.023 (0.006) for HRQoL and 0.016 (0.003) for wellbeing). The MoCA was significantly associated with wellbeing after adjusting for known covariates (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.006), Unstandardized ß (Standard Error) 0.005 (0.002) but not with health related quality of life (p<U+2009>&gt;<U+2009>0.05).CONCLUSION: We found that a measure of mobility and balance was associated with HRQoL and wellbeing. However, cognitive function was associated with wellbeing only. This study highlights the potential importance of considering wellbeing as an outcome measure if interventions are intended to have a broader impact than health alone."

Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation criteria. Cognition was evaluated by the use of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Multivariate logistic regression models estimated the association between metabolic syndrome and each of its components with cognitive performance.RESULTS: A total of 212 persons (mean age: 69.2 ± 7.2 years, 64 % women) were enrolled. Of these, 120 (57 %) had metabolic syndrome. Mean scores in the MoCA were 18.2 ± 4.6 for persons with and 19 ± 4.7 for those without metabolic syndrome. In fully adjusted logistic models, MoCA scores were not associated with metabolic syndrome (p = 0.101). After testing individual components of metabolic syndrome with the MoCA score, we found that only hypertriglyceridemia was independently associated with the MoCA score (p = 0.009).CONCLUSIONS: This population-based study showed a poor correlation of metabolic syndrome with cognitive performance after adjusting for relevant confounders. Of the individual components of metabolic syndrome, only hypertriglyceridemia correlated with worse cognitive performance."
"26113397","Usability and Validity of a Battery of Computerised Cognitive Screening Tests for Detecting Cognitive Impairment.","BACKGROUND: Computerised cognitive screening (CCS) has the potential to detect cognitive impairment in the community, which is important for the early diagnosis of dementia.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of older adults with dementia to engage with smart phone and tablet technologies and to determine the accuracy of a battery of CCS tasks to detect cognitive impairment in comparison with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).METHODS: Patients with mild-moderate dementia (n = 40) attending a university-linked day hospital and normal controls (n = 20) completed (i) a questionnaire detailing the frequency and breadth of their technology use, (ii) three commercially available CCS tasks, and (iii) the MoCA.RESULTS: The three CCS tasks were completed by 85% (n = 34) of the patients with dementia and all controls; only 4 reported the task as 'hard'. Those with dementia scored significantly lower on the CCS than controls (p &lt; 0.001). CCS scores correlated with total MoCA scores (r = 0.78, p &lt; 0.01). Further, the CCS scores significantly predicted MoCA scores, controlling for the effects of age, gender, educational attainment, and frequency of technology use (ß = 0.71, p &lt; 0.001), explaining 65.2% of the variance. Total CCS and MoCA scores (cut-off score &lt;24) had similar sensitivity (94 and 95%, respectively) and accuracy (area under the curve 0.94 and 0.99, respectively, p = 0.5) in discriminating dementia from controls, though the CSS had lower specificity (60 vs. 100% for the MoCA).CONCLUSION: The participants had little difficulty self-administering the CCS, which is an oft-cited barrier to computerised testing in this population. Our results support the criterion and construct validity of a CCS versus the commonly used MoCA. Although further research is required, CCS for cognitive impairment may be useful in the community and, by prompting referral to specialist services, could lead to an earlier diagnosis of dementia."

The study sample consisted of 1565 older adults with complete data and no evidence of dementia. Global cognitive performance was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Frailty state was defined using the Cardiovascular Health Study criteria, based on five components: unintentional weight loss, low grip strength, exhaustion, low gait speed and low physical activity.RESULTS: Total MoCA and MMSE scores, and their domain-specific scores decreased across the non-frail, pre-frail and frail groups. Poorer total MoCA and MMSE scores, as well as their domain-specific scores, were associated with the greater likelihood of being frail, but not with pre-frailty after full adjustment. The strength of the association with frailty was greater for total MoCA score than for total MMSE score. Domain-specific scores for visuospatial abilities and attention domains in both of the MoCA and MMSE were consistently associated with the likelihood of pre-frailty and frailty, even after being mutually adjusted for all domains.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA performance is more strongly associated with the odds of frailty than the MMSE performance in the relatively functional and non-demented older adult population. The present findings could contribute to further exploration of possible common pathways that can be targeted in the prevention and management for both of these two conditions.

However, the potential influence of CAS on cognitive function in patients with carotid artery stenosis and cerebral lacunar infarction has not been determined. This study investigated changes in cognitive function associated with CAS and the factors related to these changes.METHODS: This prospective cohort study comprised 579 Chinese patients with cerebral lacunar infarction and carotid artery stenosis for whom CAS was indicated, and a matched control group of 552 healthy individuals. Cognitive function before CAS and at scheduled intervals from 6 months to 3 years was assessed with instruments that included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale. Potential factors that might affect cognitive function were analyzed via logistic regression.RESULTS: The MMSE and MoCA scores of the patients before CAS were significantly lower than that of the control subjects. These scores were significantly higher 6 months after CAS and sustained or increased throughout the 3-year follow-up. Also significantly improved after CAS from baseline were scores for an alternating trail test, cube copying, clock-drawing, attention, and delayed recall in an auditory-verbal learning test. Logistic regression analyses showed that age greater than 65 y, little education, diabetes, and hypertension were independent risk factors for deteriorated MoCA scores 3 years after CAS.CONCLUSION: CAS was associated with significantly improved cognitive function in cerebral lacunar infarction patients with severe stenosis."

Individuals were grouped based on their self-reported hours of sleep (short duration = &lt;7, normal duration = 7, &gt;9, and long duration = =9). The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to discern group differences on the MoCA scores, while multinomial logistic regression was used to assess the association between MoCA and MMSE scores and sleep group.RESULTS: The long duration group had significantly lower MoCA scores than the normal duration group (p = 0.02). The short duration group was not significantly different from the normal duration group (p = 0.33). Individuals in the short duration group were more likely to have higher MoCA scores than those in long duration group after adjusting for age, gender, and presence of depressive symptoms [OR 0.86, 95 % CI (0.76, 0.98), p = 0.02].CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that in a group of non-demented, very old subjects, self-reported sleep duration of nine or more hours is associated with decreased cognitive performance on the MoCA in older adults, even after accounting for age, gender, and presence of depressive symptoms."

However, the relation between the functional state of thyroid and neuropsychiatric changes proceeding with age among people without clinical symptoms of thyroid dysfunction is still unknown. The aim of this study was analysis of cognitive function levels in reference to thyroid examination: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), total thyroxin (TT4), triiodothyronine (TT3), free thyroxin (FT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPO-AB), and thyroglobulin antibodies (Tg-AB), TSH receptor antibodies (AB-TSHR) in women after menopause.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A group of 383 women was recruited for the study. The inclusion criteria were: minimum two years after the last menstruation and no dementia signs on Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Computerized battery of Central Nervous System Vital Signs (CNS VS) test was used to diagnostic cognitive functions. The blood plasma values were determined: TSH, FT3, FT4, TT3, TT4, TPO-AB, Tg-AB, and AB-TSHR. Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson's correlation coefficient and analysis of variance in STATISTICA software.RESULTS: In women after menopause, TSH was negatively correlated with NCI results, executive functions, complex attention, and cognitive flexibility. FT4 was positively correlated with results of psychomotor speed. TT3 and TT4 were negatively correlated with results of memory and verbal memory. Furthermore, TT4 was negatively correlated with NCI, executive functions, and cognitive flexibility. TPO-AB was negatively correlated with results of memory, verbal memory, and psychomotor speed. Tg-AB was positively correlated with results of reaction time. AB-TSHR was negatively correlated with NCI results, memory, executive functions, psychomotor speed, complex attention, and cognitive flexibility.CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the importance of thyroid functionality in cognitive functioning in a group of women after menopause. The values of TSH, TT3, TT4, TPO-AB, and AB-TSHR were higher and FT4 was lower in examined women.

Forty-four participants matched for age, sex, and educational background were enrolled as the sporadic ALS group (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>22) and the control group (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>22). All participants completed comprehensive neuropsychological tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Stroop Color-Word Interference Test (SCWT), the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), and the Frontal Assessment Battery. The participants underwent a series of 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Resting-state functional MRI (Rs-fMRI) using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) was performed. Three-dimensional T1-weighted anatomical images obtained by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) were used to conduct correlation analyses and group comparisons with the demographic and neuropsychological characteristics. The results indicated that the decreased gray matter (GM) volume in the bilateral precentral gyri and increased ALFF values in the right parahippocampal gyrus, left inferior temporal gyrus, left anterior cingulate gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus, and left middle occipital gyrus were identified in the sporadic ALS group. The increased ALFF value in the right parahippocampal gyrus was positively correlated with ALS progression rate. The ALS patients exhibited poor performances on cognitive and executive tests, which were significantly or marginally significantly correlated with the ALFF values in the anterior cingulate gyrus and the frontal, temporal, and parahippocampal cortices. In conclusion, these findings provide evidence of an extramotor involvement and suggest that the ALFF value in the right parahippocampal gyrus could represent a potential marker to monitor disease progression.

The presence and number of lacunes in subjects aged over 55 years were assessed by study physicians. The WMH volume was measured by an automated method. The association between the presence and number of lacunar infarcts and of WMH volume with the total MoCA score and subdomains was assessed using linear regression with adjustment for age, gender and self-reported ethnicity.RESULTS: In 609 subjects with valid data, both the presence and the increasing number of lacunes were associated with lower MoCA scores, even after adjusting for demographic variables. The presence of lacunes was also associated with lower scores in the memory, executive and attention subdomains. The WMH volume was not significantly associated with the MoCA score.CONCLUSION: The presence and increasing number of lacunes in midlife is associated with a lower performance in multiple domains of a cognitive screening measure after adjusting for demographic factors."

"26001202","Cognitive profile of Parkinson's disease patients: a comparative study between early-onset and late-onset Parkinson's disease.","AIM: To investigate the influence of onset age on the occurrence and progression of cognitive dysfunction using neuropsychological tests and the electrophysiological component P300 in both early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) and late-onset Parkinson's disease (LOPD) patients.METHODS: A cohort of 76 EOPD patients and 166 LOPD patients was recruited for this study. Demographic information and clinical features, including age, disease duration, education level, family history, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, the Hoehn and Yahr stage, and depression scores were documented for each patient. The Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Revised, Chinese version (WAIS-RC) and Wechsler Memory Scale - Revised, Chinese version (WMS-RC) were used. In addition, P300 was also examined to assess cognitive function.RESULTS: Although EOPD patients had longer disease duration, their cognitive dysfunction progressed more slowly. The MoCA tests revealed that EOPD patients had higher scores in visuospatial function, attention, delayed recall, and orientation than the LOPD patients. The difference between the two groups on the WMS-RC test did not reach significance, whereas the scores in executive function, visuospatial function and attention as measured on the WAIS-RC test were significantly lower in the LOPD group. In addition, P300 latencies were markedly delayed and P300 amplitudes were reduced in the LOPD group.CONCLUSIONS: The current findings demonstrated that cognitive dysfunction progressed more slowly in the EOPD group. Although the LOPD patients exhibited shorter disease durations, their cognitive abilities, including executive function, visuospatial function and attention, may have been impaired."
"26000804","The use of MMSE and MoCA in patients with acute ischemic stroke in clinical.","BACKGROUND: The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) are brief cognitive screening tools that have been developed for the screening of patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment.METHODS: A total of 105 patients were included in this study, aged 53-89 years, with acute ischemic stroke admitted to hospital and fell into two groups: stroke patients with cognitive impairment (SCI) and controls with no cognitive impairment (n-SCI). The patient's characteristics are collected and regression analyses were performed to predict cognitive impairments. We use MMSE and MoCA assessment as prognostic indices for cognitive impairments of patient's with stroke.OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to examine the effectiveness of the MMSE and MoCA in screening cognitive impairments.MAIN RESULTS: There were significant difference among the two groups in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (p &lt; 0.05) and intracranial atherosclerosis (p &lt; 0.05). A linear regression determined that the age, diabetes, intracranial atherosclerosis predicted the cognitive impairments. The ROC results for MoCA with an AUC of 0.882 and the corresponding results for MMSE show a similar AUC of 0.839.CONCLUSION: Neuropsychological performance of stroke patients was influenced by biological and demographic variables: age, diabetes and intracranial atherosclerosis. The MoCA and MMSE are both reliable assessments for the diagnosis of cognitive impairment after stroke."
"25993629","The relationship between dual-task and cognitive performance among elderly participants who exercise regularly.","BACKGROUND: The dual-task performance is associated with the functionality of the elderly and it becomes more complex with age.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the Timed Up and Go dual task (TUG-DT) and cognitive tests among elderly participants who exercise regularly.METHOD: This study examined 98 non-institutionalized people over 60 years old who exercised regularly. Participants were assessed using the TUG-DT (i.e. doing the TUG while listing the days of the week in reverse order), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Clock Drawing Test (CDT), and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). The motor (i.e. time and number of steps) and cognitive (i.e. number of correct words) data were collected from TUG-DT. We used a significance level of a=0.05 and SPSS 17.0 for all data analyses.RESULTS: This current elderly sample featured a predominance of women (69.4%) who were highly educated (median=10 years of education) compared to Brazilian population and mostly non-fallers (86.7%). The volunteers showed a good performance on the TUG-DT and the other cognitive tests, except the MoCA, with scores below the cutoff of 26 points. Significant and weak correlations were observed between the TUG-DT (time) and the visuo-spatial/executive domain of the MoCA and the MMSE. The cognitive component of the TUG-DT showed strong correlations between the total MoCA performance score and its visuo-spatial/executive domain.CONCLUSIONS: The use of the TUG-DT to assess cognition is promising; however, the use of more challenging cognitive tasks should be considered when the study population has a high level of education."
"25963506","Changes in anatomical and functional connectivity of Parkinson's disease patients according to cognitive status.","PURPOSE: This study assesses the patterns of structural and functional connectivity damage in patients with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) compared with cognitively unimpaired Parkinson's disease patients (PD-Cu) and healthy controls (HC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) scans were obtained from 30 PD and 21 sex- and age-matched HC. The between-group difference in posterior cingulate (PCC) functional connectivity (FC) was performed to assess FC dysfunction. Atlas-based spatial statistics of DTI was applied to compare White matter (WM) fibers impairment between groups.RESULTS: (1) Functional connectivity: (1) PD-Cu compared with HC showed a decreased PCC functional connectivity of the right medial temporal lobe (MTL). In addition, PCC-right MTL connectivity strength of PD was significantly correlated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score. (2) PDD group shows a decreased FC of PCC-right parahippocampa compared with PD-Cu group; while show a widespread decreased PCC FC compared with HC group. (2) Anatomical connectivity: (1) Relative to PD-Cu, significant lower FA values were found in the left hippocampus in PDD. (2) PDD showed higher MD values in a widespread WM regions compared with PD-Cu and HC. (3) Positive correlation was observed between MoCA score and FA value of left inferior longitudinal and hippocampus, and bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus in PD.CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive decline in PD is associated with FC damage of PCC-right MTL and microstructural damage of left hippocampus. Nevertheless, combining fMRI and DTI method may provide markers able to contribute to the prediction of PDD."
"25962184","Mild cognitive impairment: vascular risk factors in community elderly in four cities of Hebei Province, China.","BACKGROUND: Evidence has demonstrated that vascular risk factors (VRFs) contribute to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the elderly population. Because of the race and different diagnosis standard, there is still no definitive conclusions.OBJECTIVE: To estimate the VRFs and potential protective factors for MCI in elderly population living in the community in North China.METHODS: A total of 3136 participants entered the study. They were screened for hypertension, coronary heart disease (CHD), and cerebrovascular disease (CVD). Cognitive function was assessed with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The diagnosis of MCI was made according to Petersen's criteria. We investigated the relationship between vascular risk factors, potential protective factors and MCI.RESULTS: A total of 2511 (80%) participant belonged to normal group and 625 (20%) participants showed MCI. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that stroke and diabetes, but not hypertension or CHD was associated with MCI. Besides, exercise habit could lower the risk of MCI.CONCLUSIONS: Vascular Risk Factors, including stroke and diabetes, rather than hypertension and CHD are independent risk factors of MCI. Involvement in physical activities seems to reduce the risk of MCI."
"25958706","The factors associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in surgical menopause women.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: As a sizeable proportion of persons with mild cognitive impairment will progress to frank dementia, early detection is an important strategy to prevent and decelerate the progression of cognitive decline. In Thailand, the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment in surgical menopause women has not been well established. The objectives of the present study were to determine the percentage and factors associated with mild cognitive impairment in women with surgical menopause.MATERIAL AND METHOD: Between October 2013 and July 2014, 200 eligible women at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital were enrolled. The self-reported questionnaires were used to obtain the demographic data and the Thai version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The MCI was diagnosed when the MoCA score was less than 25. The data were statistically analyzed using SPSS version 17 for student t-test, Chi-square test, and multiple regression analysis.RESULTS: The percentage of MCI in the present study was 43.5%. The univariate analysis showed that factors significantly related to MCI were marital status, educational levels, occupation, monthly income, and duration of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Nevertheless, multiple regression analysis revealed that only older age at enrollment, marital status, low educational level, and low monthly income were significantly related to MCI.CONCLUSION: Almost half of the surgical menopause women in the present study had MCI. Older age at enrollment, marital status, low educational level, and low monthly income were significantly related to MCI. Age at surgical menopause and HRT were not found to be associated with MCI in this study."
"25957568","Subclinical atherosclerosis and subsequent cognitive function.","OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between measures of subclinical atherosclerosis and subsequent cognitive function.METHOD: Participants from the Dallas Heart Study (DHS), a population-based multiethnic study of cardiovascular disease pathogenesis, were re-examined 8 years later (DHS-2) with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); N = 1904, mean age = 42.9, range 8-65. Associations of baseline measures of subclinical atherosclerosis (coronary artery calcium, abdominal aortic plaque, and abdominal aortic wall thickness) with MoCA scores measured at follow-up were examined in the group as a whole and in relation to age and ApoE4 status.RESULTS: A significant linear trend of successively lower MoCA scores with increasing numbers of atherosclerotic indicators was observed (F(3, 1150) = 5.918, p = .001). CAC was weakly correlated with MoCA scores (p = .047) and MoCA scores were significantly different between participants with and without CAC (M = 22.35 vs 23.69, p = 0.038). With the exception of a small association between abdominal AWT and MoCA in subjects over age 50, abdominal AWT and abdominal aortic plaque did not correlate with MoCA total score (p = .052). Cognitive scores and atherosclerosis measures were not impacted by ApoE4 status (p = .455).CONCLUSION: In this ethnically diverse population-based sample, subclinical atherosclerosis was minimally associated with later cognitive function in middle-aged adults."

"25942388","Age- and education-adjusted normative data for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in older adults age 70-99.","The original validation study for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) suggests a cutoff score of 26; however, this may be too stringent for older adults, particularly for those with less education. Given the rapidly increasing number of older adults and associated risk of dementia, this study aims to provide appropriate age- and education-adjusted norms for the MoCA. Data from 205 participants in an ongoing longevity study were used to derive normative data. Individuals were grouped based on age (70-79, 80-89, 90-99) and education level (=12 Years, 13-15, =16 Years). There were significant differences between age and education groups with younger and more educated participants outperforming their counterparts. Forty-six percent of our sample scored below the suggested cutoff of 26. These normative data may provide a more accurate representation of MoCA performance in older adults for specific age and education stratifications."
"25939560","MoCA as a Screening Tool of Neuropsychological Deficits in Alcohol-Dependent Patients.","BACKGROUND: Alcoholism is known to be associated with cognitive deficits mainly concerning visuospatial capacity, executive function, memory, and attention. These impairments may affect treatment efficacy which should therefore be adapted. We evaluated the potential utility of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to evaluate cognitive impairment in a large series of alcoholic patients hospitalized for withdrawal and rehabilitation.METHODS: Consecutive recruitment during a time period of patients admitted to an addiction treatment unit of a teaching hospital. Administration of the MoCA test on admission by trained staff members.RESULTS: A total of 166 patients aged 49.9 ± 9.2 years were included. Mean duration of administration was 20 minutes. The mean MoCA score was 23.5 ± 3.5 and 68.1% had an impaired value (&lt;26). Age was negatively and education was positively associated with the MoCA score. Significant cognitive deficits concerned visuospatial capacity, attention, fluency, abstraction, and delayed recall. Neither age nor sex was significantly related to the MoCA score, while having a high education level (&gt;12 years) significantly increased the likelihood of having a high MoCA score.CONCLUSIONS: Owing to their severity and frequency, screening for cognitive deficits is necessary in alcoholics during rehabilitation. MoCA is an appropriate tool for this purpose."
"25938478","Weight loss and impact on quality of life in Parkinson's disease.","INTRODUCTION: Weight loss is common in Parkinson's Disease (PD) and sometimes may precede the diagnosis. Weight loss is associated with multiple factors but its impact on health-related quality of life (HRQL) in PD remains unknown. We sought to investigate the factors associated with weight change and to quantify its effect on HRQL.METHODS: The National Parkinson Foundation Quality Improvement Initiative (NPF-QII) data was used to analyze PD patients longitudinally between two visits, separated by 12 ± 6 months. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to assess the associations between baseline covariates and body weight change per month, and to evaluate whether, and to what degree, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) scores were affected.RESULTS: A higher Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage, higher number of comorbidities, older age, lower MOCA estimate, and higher rate of levodopa usage were observed in patients who lost weight. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that age and levodopa usage were significantly associated with weight loss. Furthermore, monthly body weight loss was significantly associated with HRQL decline in PD patients. Loss of 1 lb (0.45 kg) per month was associated with a decline in QOL: an increase of 0.5% in PDQ-39 Summary Index score (p=0.004), and 1.1% and 1.5% increases in the mobility and ADL dimensions, respectively.CONCLUSION: Weight loss in PD is common and seems to correlate with worsened HRQL. Awareness of factors associated with weight loss and its relation to HRQL may help practitioners improve patient management and expectations."
"25916921","[Correlations between olfactory and cognitive functions in early stage Parkinson's disease].","OBJECTIVE: To explore the general characteristics of olfactory and cognitive functions in early Parkinson's disease (PD) and examine their correlations.METHODS: The olfactory functions were assessed for 63 PD patients and 55 age and gender-matched normal subjects using T&amp;T olfactory assessment. The scales of mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) were employed. The olfactory and cognitive parameters and their relationship were analyzed. There were five different odors in T&amp;T testing liquid and each odor had 5 concentration gradients. The level had an assigned value of 1 to 5 and number 3 represented the standard threshold of olfactory recognition. The mean value of five odors was overall olfactory detection or cognition threshold.RESULTS: (1) The olfactory detection and recognition thresholds were 4.0 ± 1.3/4.8 ± 0.9 in PD group versus 2.5 ± 0.9/2.9 ± 0.9 in normal controls. The scores of MoCA and MMSE were lower in PD group than those in controls (23.7 ± 3.0 vs 25.9 ± 2.0, t = 4.727, P = 0.000; 27.8 ± 1.9 vs 28.9 ± 0.9, t = 4.036, P = 0.000). (2) Linear correlation analysis showed that olfactory recognition threshold was correlated negatively with MoCA scores. The olfactory detection and recognition thresholds were correlated negatively with the score of visual-spatial perception and executive capability (r = -0.365, -0.403, P &lt; 0.05). The olfactory recognition threshold was correlated negatively with the score of delayed memory (r = -0.299, P &lt; 0.05). And this phenomenon was absent in controls.CONCLUSION: Early PD patients have olfactory dysfunction and cognitive impairment. And these two non-motor symptoms are negatively correlated."
"25907322","Frailty and poor functional status are common in arterial vascular surgical patients and affect postoperative outcomes.","OBJECTIVES: Increasing numbers of older people are undergoing emergency and elective arterial vascular procedures. Many older patients are frail which is a recognised predictor of adverse postoperative outcomes in other surgical specialties. This study in older patients undergoing arterial vascular surgery examined; the prevalence of preoperative frailty; the clinical feasibility of preoperatively measuring frailty and functional status; the association between these characteristics and adverse postoperative outcome.METHODS: Prospective observational study in patients aged over 60 years undergoing elective and emergency arterial vascular surgery. Baseline measures of frailty (Edmonton Frail Scale), functional status (gait velocity, timed up and go, hand grip strength) and cognitive function (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) were obtained preoperatively. The primary outcome measure Length of Stay (LOS) and secondary outcome measures of postoperative morbidity (medical and surgical complications), functional status and postoperative in-hospital mortality were recorded.RESULTS: 125 patients were recruited. Frailty was common in this older surgical population (52% EFS score of = 6.5) with high frailty scores observed (mean EFS 6.6, SD 3.05) and poor functional status (60% had TUG &gt; 15 s, 45% had gait velocity of &lt; 0.6 m/s). Higher preoperative EFS (&gt; 6.5) was univariately associated with longer LOS (= 12 days), composite measures of postoperative infections, postoperative medical complications and adverse functional outcomes. EFS = 6.5 was predictive of LOS = 12 days, adjusted for age (AUC 0.660, CI 0.541-0.779, p = 0.010). This association between EFS = 6.5 and LOS = 12 days was strengthened with the addition of MoCA &lt; 24 (AUC 0.695, CI 0.584-0.806, p = 0.002).CONCLUSIONS: Patients aged over 60 years admitted for arterial vascular surgery were frail, had impaired functional status and were cognitively impaired. This combination of preoperative characteristics was predictive of longer hospital length of stay and associated with adverse postoperative outcome."
"25903433","A study on cognitive impairment and gray matter volume abnormalities in silent cerebral infarction patients.","INTRODUCTION: The relationship between silent cerebral infarction (SCI) and the integrity of cognitive function is unknown. We intended to investigate whether cognitive impairment is associated with gray matter volume (GMV) in the SCI patients.METHODS: Sixty-two patients with SCI and 62 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC) were evaluated with P300 test, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test, Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and Hamilton Depression Scale (HDRS). Whole brain high-resolution T1-weighted images were processed with SPM12b software and analyzed by voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Correlation analysis was performed between the GMV and the scores of MoCA Scale, P300 latency, P300 amplitude, HAMA, HDRS, age, and educational level.RESULTS: The brains of the SCI patients have a significant reduction in GMV in the left superior and inferior frontal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, and bilateral hippocampus gyrus (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01, FDR correction). No significant increase of GMV was detected. The GMV of their frontal and temporal lobes is positively correlated with the score of MoCA scale and P300 amplitude (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.62, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01). The GMV of frontal, temporal, and hippocampus is negatively correlated with P300 latency (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.71, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). No significant correlation between the GMV of abnormal brain regions and another two clinical characteristics was found.CONCLUSION: SCI patients have impaired cognitive function and reduced GMV compared to the HC subjects. The neuropathological basis of such cognitive deficits in SCI patients might be a reduced GMV."

The relationship between ambulatory BP patterns and cognitive function in community-living older adults is unknown.METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in which 24-hour ambulatory BP, in-clinic BP, and cognitive function measures were obtained from 319 community-living older adults.RESULTS: The mean age was 72 years, 66% were female, and 13% were African-American. We performed linear regression with performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as the primary outcome and 24-hour BP patterns as the independent variable, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and comorbidities. Greater nighttime systolic dipping (P = 0.046) and higher 24-hour diastolic BP (DBP; P = 0.015) were both significantly associated with better cognitive function, whereas 24-hour systolic BP (SBP), average real variability, and ambulatory arterial stiffness were not.CONCLUSIONS: Higher 24-hour DBP and greater nighttime systolic dipping were significantly associated with improved cognitive function. Future studies should examine whether low 24-hour DBP and lack of nighttime systolic dipping predict future cognitive impairment."
"25896289","Diurnal drooling in Chinese patients with Parkinson's disease.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the prevalence and clinical correlates of diurnal drooling in Chinese patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of 518 Chinese patients with PD was conducted. Each subject was categorized as a diurnal &quot;drooler&quot; or a &quot;non-drooler&quot; using the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS).RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-one (23.4%) patients exhibited diurnal drooling. Diurnal drooling was reported more frequently in male and late-onset PD patients (p&lt;0.05). The levodopa equivalent daily doses, mean age and disease duration, the percentages of PD family history and levodopa or entacapone use, the incidences of dysarthria, dysphagia and fluctuation, and the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III, NMSS, Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) and PD Questionnaire 39 (PDQ-39) scores in droolers were significantly greater than in non-droolers (p&lt;0.05). The percentage of benzhexol use in non-droolers was significantly higher than in droolers (p&lt;0.05). The Frontal assessment battery (FAB) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores were not different between the droolers and non-droolers. The forward binary logistic regression model indicated that dysarthria, male sex, age, UPDRS part III, sexual dysfunction and a family history of PD were associated with diurnal drooling.CONCLUSIONS: Diurnal drooling is a relatively common debilitating symptom in Chinese PD patients. It is not only related to male sex, age, dysarthria and PD family history, but also correlates with motor and non-motor severity especially sexual dysfunction of PD. However, it is not related to cognition."

Depression was evaluated with Beck's depression inventory (BDI). Cognitive functions were evaluated with Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA), paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT), spatial recall test (SRT), symbol digit modalities (SDMT), and word list generation (WLG).RESULTS: The mean gestational age, educational level and account of previous birth of the subjects in the study were not statistically different between the groups. The mean scores of BDI of the 2 groups were not statistically different. MOCA score and SDMT was significantly decreased in GDM in comparison to NP (p=0.005, p=0.04 respectively). Also, SDMT score was inversely correlated with number of pregnancies, postprandial blood glucose and HbA1c.The scores of PASAT, SRT, SPART and WLG were statistically similar between the groups.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may be a clue for early onset of impairment in cognitive functions in cases with new onset diabetes during pregnancy."
"25817619","Can the Montreal Cognitive Assessment predict discharge destination in a stroke population in the hospital?","BACKGROUND: To decide on an appropriate discharge destination for stroke survivors from hospital, factors such as activities of daily living and age are often taken into account as predictors. Cognition has been found to support the decision whether to send a patient home or to a dependent living situation. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) has been proven to be a suitable cognitive screening instrument in the acute phase after stroke. However, its predictive value in the determination of discharge destination is unknown. The aim of the present study was to examine whether cognitive functioning, as measured with the MOCA, in the acute phase after stroke could predict discharge destination.METHODS: The study involved 211 patients with a first-ever cerebral stroke within the first week after stroke. Demographic and stroke-specific data, cognitive functioning (MOCA), and level of functional disability (Barthel Index [BI]) were collected. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to predict discharge destination (dependent versus independent living situation).RESULTS: Both age (B = -.05; P &lt; .01) and BI score (B = .33; P &lt; .001) were found to be significantly related to discharge destination with explained variance of 43%. Adding MOCA score as a predictor variable to the model resulted in a nonsignificant improvement of the model, explaining 44% of the variance.CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive functioning, as measured by a single screening instrument such as the MOCA, in the acute phase after stroke is not predictive for discharge destination."
"25797790","Domains and correlates of clinical balance impairment associated with Huntington's disease.","This study sought to (a) determine the domains of clinical balance impairments associated with Huntington's disease (HD), and (b) evaluate associations between balance test scores and other disease-related impairments. Eighteen subjects with genetically definite HD and 17 age-matched control subjects were evaluated on the Mini-BESTest for their clinical balance impairments as well as the Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS) motor and total functional capacity scales, Activity-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale-short form, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). Results showed that subjects with HD exhibited significantly lower total Mini-BESTest scores than subjects without HD (mean (95% CI)=76 (64-87)% with HD, 98 (96-99)% without HD; p=0.0011). Mini-BESTest item scores were significantly lower for subjects with HD on one-leg stance, postural responses, standing with eyes closed on foam, and dual-task timed up-and-go. Mini-BESTest scores significantly correlated with UHDRS motor (r(2)=0.68; p=0.00003) and total functional capacity (r(2)=0.75; p=0.000006) scores as well as with scores on the ABC short form (r(2)=0.45; p=0.0024), SDMT (r(2)=0.42; p=0.0036), and MoCA (r(2)=0.23; p=0.046) assessments. This study, therefore, demonstrates that balance impairments associated with HD span domains of anticipatory postural adjustments, postural responses, stance in challenging sensory conditions, and gait. Although preliminary, clinical balance impairment appears to be an efficient proxy evaluation of multiple HD-related factors due to associations with functional capacity, other motor impairments, balance confidence, and cognitive abilities.

"25793613","Serum levels of inflammatory markers in depressed elderly patients with diabetes and mild cognitive impairment.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the serum levels of CRP, IL-6 and TNF-a in elderly diabetic patients with depressive syndrome alone or with coexisting mild cognitive impairment (MCI).METHODS: 276 diabetics elders were screened for depressive symptoms (using Geriatric Depression Scale: GDS-30) and MCI (using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment: MoCA score). Data of HbA1c, blood lipids and inflammatory markers levels were collected.RESULTS: In all groups of patients levels of CRP, IL-6 and TNF-a were significantly higher as compared to controls. The highest level of inflammatory markers was detected in group with depressive mood and coexisting MCI, however IL-6 level didn't significantly differ as compared to MCI group. We founded correlations between all inflammatory markers in group of patients with depressive mood and in group of subjects with depressive symptoms and coexisting MCI. GDS-30 score was correlated with levels of inflammatory markers in group with depressive mood, and with levels of CRP and TNF-a in group with depressive mood and coexisting MCI. In the group with depressive mood and coexisting MCI we founded that MoCA score was negatively correlated with CRP and TNF-a levels; and HbA1c level was positively correlated with all inflammatory markers. The univariate logistic regression models revealed that variables which increased the likelihood of having been diagnosed with MCI in depressed patients were: higher levels of HbA1c, CRP, IL-6 and TNF-a, previous CVD or stroke, increased number of co-morbidities and microvascular complications, older age, less years of formal education. The multivariable model showed that previous CVD, higher HbA1c and IL-6 levels are significant factors.CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the presence of depressive syndrome is associated with higher levels of inflammatory markers in elderly patients with diabetes. The presence of MCI in these depressed subjects has additive effect on levels of inflammatory mediators."

Their examination involved clinical, metabolic, and psychological testing. The quality of life was assessed using the general Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (MOS SF-36) and the specific Audit-Dependent Quality of Life (AdDQoL). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCa test) was employed to screen for cognitive impairments. All the patients were advised by a neurologist. Brain MRI using a 1.0 T Siemens Magnetom scanner was carried out to evaluate structural changes in the central nervous system.RESULTS: The examination of the patients with DM1 revealed the signs of grey matter atrophy, enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces, white matter injury, which correlated with the presence of chronic hyperglycemia, cognitive impairments, and microvascular complications.CONCLUSIONS: Routine brain MRI is best carried out in patients with DMI and poor disease control to timely implement therapeutic-and-prophylactic measures for preventing cognitive impairments and improving the quality of life."
"25766087","The Cognitive Assessment scale for Stroke Patients (CASP) vs. MMSE and MoCA in non-aphasic hemispheric stroke patients.","INTRODUCTION: CASP specifically assesses post-stroke cognitive impairments. Its items are visual and as such can be administered to patients with severe expressive aphasia. We have previously shown that the CASP was more suitable than the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in aphasic patients. Our objective was to compare the above scales in non-aphasic stroke patients, and assess to what extent the solely visual items of the CASP were problematic in cases of neurovisual impairments.METHODS: Fifty non-aphasic patients admitted to Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&amp;R) units after a recent left- or right-hemisphere stroke were evaluated with the CASP, MMSE and MoCA. We compared these three scales in terms of feasibility, concordance, and influence of neurovisual impairments on the total score.RESULTS: Twenty-nine men and 21 women were included (mean age 63 ± 14). For three patients, the MoCa was impossible to administer. It took significantly less time to administer the CASP (10 ± 5 min) than the MoCA (11 ± 5 min, P=0.02), yet it still took more time than MMSE administration (7 ± 3 min, P&lt;10(-6)). Neurovisual impairments affected equally the total scores of the three tests. Concordance between these scores was poor and only the CASP could specifically assess unilateral spatial neglect.CONCLUSION: The sole visual format of the CASP scale seems suitable for administration in post-stroke patients."

Previous studies have shown that individuals can effectively improve physical and cognitive training, improved in independent living and everyday competence. The purpose of the study was to investigate influence of the intervention program applying functional fitness and cognitive training to disabled residents in the institution. The subjects were disabled persons of a care institution in southern Taiwan and were randomly divided into training and control groups, both having 17 subjects. The age of the subjects was between 56 and 98 years with a mean age of 79.08 ± 10.04 years; the subjects of training group implemented 12 weeks of training on physical and cognitive training, while the control group subjects did not have any training program. The results revealed that subjects of the training group have significantly improved their functional shoulder rotation flexibility of left and right anterior hip muscle group flexibility of right, sitting functional balance of left and right, naming, attention, delayed recall, orientation, and Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA). The study suggested developing physical fitness programs and physical and cognitive prescriptions for the disabled people of the institutions. "
"25737166","Cognitive performance and neuropsychiatric symptoms in early, untreated Parkinson's disease.","This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence and correlates of cognitive impairment (CI) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in early, untreated patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).</AbstractText>: This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence and correlates of cognitive impairment (CI) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in early, untreated patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).BACKGROUND: Both CI and NPS are common in PD and impact disease course and quality of life. However, limited knowledge is available about cognitive abilities and NPS.METHODS: Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) is a multi-site study of early, untreated PD patients and healthy controls (HCs), the latter with normal cognition. At baseline, participants were assessed with a neuropsychological battery and for symptoms of depression, anxiety, impulse control disorders (ICDs), psychosis, and apathy.RESULTS: Baseline data of 423 PD patients and 196 HCs yielded no between-group differences in demographic characteristics. Twenty-two percent of PD patients met the PD-recommended screening cutoff for CI on the Montral Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), but only 9% met detailed neuropsychological testing criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-level impairment. The PD patients were more depressed than HCs (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001), with twice as many (14% vs. 7%) meeting criteria for clinically significant depressive symptoms. The PD patients also experienced more anxiety (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) and apathy (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) than HCs. Psychosis was uncommon in PD (3%), and no between-group difference was seen in ICD symptoms (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.51).CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 10% of PD patients in the early, untreated disease state met traditional criteria of CI, which is a lower frequency compared with previous studies. Multiple dopaminergic-dependent NPS are also more common in these patients compared with the general population, but others associated with dopamine replacement therapy are not or are rare. Future analyses of this cohort will examine biological predictors and the course of CI and NPS. © 2015 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society."

In the present study, we simultaneously examined cognitive and affective ability in MSA with predominant cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C, n=25), MSA with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P, n=8), and CCA (n=14) patients using computerized touch panel screening tests. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Hasegawa dementia scale-revised (HDS-R), frontal assessment battery (FAB), and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scores were significantly lower in MSA-C patients than in age-and gender-matched normal controls. One MSA-C patient showed a decrease in the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of the frontal lobe. MSA-P patients showed no such cognitive decline. Only FAB and MoCA scores were significantly lower in the CCA patients. MSA and CCA patients also showed a mild to moderate depressive state. Touch-panel screening tests demonstrated a significant decline of beating devils game in all three disease groups including MSA-P patients, and a significant extension of the flipping cards game only in MSA-C patients. The present study demonstrated different cognitive and affective functions among MSA-C, MSA-P, and CCA patients, and a sensitive screening method for cognitive assessment using touch-panel tests. "
"25724660","Cognitive performance in community-dwelling older adults with stroke and the contribution of age and diffuse subcortical damage: a population-based study in rural Ecuador (The Atahualpa Project).","BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is common among stroke survivors. However, there is controversy on the role of the stroke itself or the associated subcortical damage in post-stroke cognitive decline.AIM: To assess the independent contribution and the interaction of age, the stroke itself and diffuse subcortical damage in the poor cognitive performance observed in patients with stroke.METHODS: Atahualpa residents aged =60 years were identified during a door-to-door survey and invited to undergo brain MRI for identification of stroke lesions and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) of presumed vascular origin. Cognitive performance was evaluated by the use of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Using a generalized linear model, we examined the association between MoCA score, stroke and WMH, after adjusting for demographics, education, vascular risk factors, depression and edentulism.RESULTS: Out of 311 persons aged =60 years, 242 (78 %) were enrolled. MRI showed strokes in 39 (16 %) and moderate-to-severe WMH in 52 (22 %) cases. Mean MoCA score was 18.5 ± 4.7 in the entire population. When participants were stratified according to the median age of the population (67 years), the generalized linear model showed that MoCA scores were not different in younger persons irrespective of the presence of stroke or WMH. In contrast, increased age associated with lower MoCA scores in persons with WMH (p = 0.002) or with both stroke and WMH (p = 0.003), but not in those with stroke without WMH (p = 0.087).CONCLUSIONS: Interaction of age and diffuse subcortical damage are major determinants for poor cognitive performance among stroke patients."
"25700290","Montreal Cognitive Assessment 5-minute protocol is a brief, valid, reliable, and feasible cognitive screen for telephone administration.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network Vascular Cognitive Impairment Harmonization working group proposed a brief cognitive protocol for screening of vascular cognitive impairment. We investigated the validity, reliability, and feasibility of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 5-minute protocol (MoCA 5-minute protocol) administered over the telephone.METHODS: Four items examining attention, verbal learning and memory, executive functions/language, and orientation were extracted from the MoCA to form the MoCA 5-minute protocol. One hundred four patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack, including 53 with normal cognition (Clinical Dementia Rating, 0) and 51 with cognitive impairment (Clinical Dementia Rating, 0.5 or 1), were administered the MoCA in clinic and a month later, the MoCA 5-minute protocol over the telephone.RESULTS: Administration of the MoCA 5-minute protocol took 5 minutes over the telephone. Total score of the MoCA 5-minute protocol correlated negatively with age (r=-0.36; P&lt;0.001) and positively with years of education (r=0.41; P&lt;0.001) but not with sex (<U+03C1>=0.03; P=0.773). Total scores of the MoCA and MoCA 5-minute protocol were highly correlated (r=0.87; P&lt;0.001). The MoCA 5-minute protocol performed equally well as the MoCA in differentiating patients with cognitive impairment from those without (areas under receiver operating characteristics curve for MoCA 5-minute protocol, 0.78; MoCA=0.74; P&gt;0.05 for difference; Cohen d for group difference, 0.80-1.13). It differentiated cognitively impaired patients with executive domain impairment from those without (areas under receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.89; P&lt;0.001; Cohen d=1.7 for group difference). Thirty-day test-retest reliability was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.89).CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA 5-minute protocol is a free, valid, and reliable cognitive screen for stroke and transient ischemic attack. It is brief and highly feasible for telephone administration."
"25685335","Characteristics of language impairment in Parkinson's disease and its influencing factors.","BACKGROUND: Language impairment is relatively common in Parkinson's disease (PD), but not all PD patients are susceptible to language problems. In this study, we identified among a sample of PD patients those pre-disposed to language impairment, describe their clinical profiles, and consider factors that may precipitate language disability in these patients.METHODS: A cross-sectional cohort of 31 PD patients and 20 controls were administered the Chinese version of the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) to assess language abilities, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to determine cognitive status. PD patients were then apportioned to a language-impaired PD (LI-PD) group or a PD group with no language impairment (NLI-PD). Performance on the WAB and MoCA was investigated for correlation with the aphasia quotient deterioration rate (AQDR).RESULTS: The PD patients scored significantly lower on most of the WAB subtests than did the controls. The aphasia quotient, cortical quotient, and spontaneous speech and naming subtests of the WAB were significantly different between LI-PD and NLI-PD groups. The AQDR scores significantly and positively correlated with age at onset and motor function deterioration.CONCLUSION: A subset group was susceptible to language dysfunction, a major deficit in spontaneous speech. Once established, dysphasia progression is closely associated with age at onset and motor disability progression."
"25673447","Memory dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus correlates with reduced hippocampal CA1 and subiculum volumes.","BACKGROUND: Little attention has been paid to the role of subcortical deep gray matter (SDGM) structures in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)-induced cognitive impairment, especially hippocampal subfields. Our aims were to assess the in vivo volumes of SDGM structures and hippocampal subfields using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to test their associations with cognitive performance in T2DM.METHODS: A total of 80 T2DM patients and 80 neurologically unimpaired healthy controls matched by age, sex and education level was enrolled in this study. We assessed the volumes of the SDGM structures and seven hippocampal subfields on MRI using a novel technique that enabled automated volumetry. We used Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores as measures of cognitive performance. The association of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) with SDGM structures and neuropsychological tests and correlations between hippocampal subfields and neuropsychological tests were assessed by partial correlation analysis in T2DM.RESULTS: Bilaterally, the hippocampal volumes were smaller in T2DM patients, mainly in the CA1 and subiculum subfields. Partial correlation analysis showed that the MoCA scores, particularly those regarding delayed memory, were significantly positively correlated with reduced hippocampal CA1 and subiculum volumes in T2DM patients. Additionally, higher HbA1c levels were significantly associated with poor memory performance and hippocampal atrophy among T2DM patients.CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the hippocampus might be the main affected region among the SDGM structures in T2DM. These structural changes in the hippocampal CA1 and subiculum areas might be at the core of underlying neurobiological mechanisms of hippocampal dysfunction, suggesting that degeneration in these regions could be responsible for memory impairments in T2DM patients."
"25653530","Aberrant spontaneous low-frequency brain activity in male patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea revealed by resting-state functional MRI.","BACKGROUND: The majority of previous neuroimaging studies have demonstrated both structural and functional abnormalities in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, few studies have focused on the regional intensity of spontaneous fluctuations during the resting state and the relationship between the abnormal properties and the behavioral performances. In the present study, we employed the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) method to explore the local features of spontaneous brain activity in OSA patients (OSAs).METHODS: Twenty-five untreated male severe OSAs and 25 age-matched and years-of-education-matched male good sleepers (GSs) were included in this study. The ALFF method was used to assess the local features of spontaneous brain activity. The mean signal values of the altered ALFF areas were analyzed with receiver operating characteristic curve. Partial correlation analysis was used to explore the relationship between the observed mean ALFF values of the different areas and the behavioral performances.RESULTS: Compared with GSs, OSAs had significantly higher scores for body mass index, apnea-hypopnea index, arterial oxygen saturation &lt;90%, arousal index, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score; furthermore, OSAs had significantly lower scores for rapid eye movement sleep and in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Compared with GSs, OSAs showed significant lower-ALFF areas in the cluster of the right precuneus and bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus, as well as a higher-ALFF area in the left inferior frontal gyrus. The area under the curve values of the lower- and higher-ALFF areas were 0.90 and 0.93, respectively. Further diagnostic analysis exhibited that the sensibility and specificity of the two clusters were 80% and 92%, respectively. The mean signal value of the lower-ALFF cluster displayed significant positive correlations with lowest oxygen saturation (r=0.447, P=0.025) and MoCA score (r =0.405, P=0.045).CONCLUSION: OSAs may involve in a dysfunction in the default mode network and an adaptive compensatory response in the frontal lobe, which reflect the underlying pathophysiology of cognitive impairment."

"25639837","Depression, anxiety, and cognitive functioning after intracerebral hemorrhage.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Post-stroke depression (PSD) is an important complication of stroke. We studied long-term PSD after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) at young age, as well as anxiety, and cognitive functioning of the survivors.METHODS: We gathered clinical and imaging data of 336 young ICH patients between age 16 and 49 treated in the Helsinki University Central Hospital. After a median follow-up of 9.7 (7.0-12.0) years, we interviewed 130 survivors with structural questionnaires including Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale (PASS), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with PSD (BDI-II score &gt;13). Degree of disability was measured by modified Rankin Scale score (mRS).RESULTS: PSD was present among 30 (23.1%) and anxiety among 52 (40.0%) patients (HADS score &gt;6). Higher degree of disability was associated with symptoms of depression (higher BDI-II scores, P = 0.001), emotional distress (higher HADS scores, P = 0.004), and pain (higher PASS scores, P = 0.008, and higher BPI scores, P = 0.003). The only baseline factor identified to associate with PSD was hydrocephalus (P = 0.014). Median PASS score was 9 (IQR 0-25), median BPI score was 5 (0-23), and median MoCA score was 26 (22-28) hinting to normal or mild cognitive dysfunction. Antidepressants were used by 9.2%.CONCLUSIONS: One of four survivors of ICH at young age suffers long-term PSD. Higher degree of disability predicted occurrence of PSD. Treatment of depression appears as an unmet need in young ICH survivors."
"25633767","Normative scores of the Cambridge Cognitive Examination-Revised in healthy Spanish population.","BACKGROUND: The Cambridge Cognitive Examination-Revised (CAMCOG) is widely used in clinical, epidemiological and research studies, but normative scores for age and educational level have not yet been established in the Spanish population.METHOD: The CAMCOG-R was administered to 730 adult members ofthe community, aged between 50-97 years, living throughout the region of Galicia. Initial screening yielded provisional identification of cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms. The final sample consisted of 643 cognitively healthy adults. The following instruments were administered: a questionnaire concerning socio-demographic and clinical data, the Charlson's Comorbidity Index, the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Lawton and Brody Index, a short version of the Geriatric Depression Scale, and the CASP-19 quality of life scale.RESULTS: Internal consistency values of the CAMCOG-R were similar to those obtained for the original scale. The convergent validity between MoCA and CAMCOG-R was good, and the divergent validity between CASP-19 and CAMCOG-R was higher than the recommended value. Percentiles and inter-quartile range for age and educational level were calculated.CONCLUSIONS: Psychometric indexes showed that the CAMCOG-R is a reliable and valid instrument, which can generally avoid a ceiling effect. The study findings confirm the importance of specifying the normative data by age and educational level."
"25622738","[Association between inflammation and cognitive function and effects of continuous positive airway pressure treatment in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome].","OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between serum inflammation levels and cognitive function in patients with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndromes (OSAHS) and evaluate the effects of continuous positive airway pressure treatment (CPAP) on serum inflammation levels and cognitive function.METHODS: A total of 139 eligible patients were monitored by overnight polysomnography (PSG) at Sleep Center, Second Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University from June 2011 to April 2013. Based on the results of apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), they were divided into 4 groups of primary snoring (n = 18), mild OSAHS(n = 23), moderate OSAHS (n = 29) and severe OSAHS (n = 69). The questionnaires of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were administered to assess cognitive function and daytime sleepiness. The serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP), leptin and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) were detected to evaluate systemic inflammation. The questionnaire scores, serum levels of Hs-CRP, leptin and TNF-a and PSG parameters were compared among 4 groups. Thirty-three patients in severe OSAHS group (treatment group) with good adherence were evaluated at baseline and after long-time CPAP treatment.RESULTS: Compared to primary snoring group, the serum Hs-CRP ((1.77 ± 1.19) vs (0.92 ± 0.82) mg/L), leptin ((15.21 ± 13.26) vs (6.35 ± 4.51) mmol/L) and TNF-a ((21.04 ± 7.78) vs (10.30 ± 5.23) pmol/L) levels increased significantly in severe OSAHS group (P &lt; 0.05). After adjusting for body mass index (BMI), age and education years, MoCA scores showed negative correlations with serum TNF-a, AHI, oxygen reduction index (ODI) and TS90% (r = -0.266, -0.236, -0.201, -0.18 respectively, all P &lt; 0.05) and positive correlations with minimum oxygen saturation (LSaO(2)) (r = 0.224, P &lt; 0.05). The evaluations of MoCA subdomains further revealed selective reductions in visual space, executive function, attention and delayed memory function. The treatment group with good adherence to &gt; 6-month continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment and after CPAP treatment, the serum levels of Hs-CRP, TNF-a and leptin improved markedly ((1.20 ± 0.88) vs (2.03 ± 1.58) mg/L, (14.12 ± 4.34) vs (22.74 ± 6.72) pmol/L and (7.37 ± 5.30) vs (13.69 ± 7.17) mmol/L respectively). The scores of MoCA and ESS also improved (27.79 ± 1.69 vs 24.76 ± 2.57, 4.33 ± 3.14 vs 12.61 ± 5.80 respectively) (all P &lt; 0.01). The score of all MoCA subdomains improved after treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive dysfunction and inflammatory reaction are common in OSAHS patients. MoCA scores are correlated significantly with serum level of TNF-a and nocturnal intermittent hypoxia. Systemic inflammation may play an important role in cognitive dysfunction of OSAHS patients. And long-time CPAP treatment can improve systemic inflammatory response and cognitive impairment."
"25603424","Performance of three cognitive screening tools in a sample of older New Zealanders.","BACKGROUND: With the ubiquitous Mini-Mental State Exam now under copyright, attention is turning to alternative cognitive screening tests. The aim of the present study was to investigate three common cognitive screening tools: the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS), and the recently revised Addenbrooke's Cognitive Assessment Version III (ACE-III).METHODS: The ACE-III, MoCA and RUDAS were administered in random order to a sample of 37 participants with diagnosed mild dementia and 47 comparison participants without dementia. The diagnostic accuracy of the three tests was assessed.RESULTS: All the tests showed good overall accuracy as assessed by area under the ROC Curve, 0.89 (95% CI = 0.80-0.95) for the ACE-III, 0.84 (0.75-0.91) for the MoCA, and 0.86 (0.77-0.93) for RUDAS. The three tests were strongly correlated: r(84) = 0.85 (0.78-0.90) between the ACE-III and MoCA, 0.70 (0.57-0.80) between the ACE-III and RUDAS; and 0.65 (0.50-0.76) between the MoCA and RUDAS.

"25586092","The genetic basis for cognitive ability, memory, and depression symptomatology in middle-aged and elderly chinese twins.","The genetic influences on aging-related phenotypes, including cognition and depression, have been well confirmed in the Western populations. We performed the first twin-based analysis on cognitive performance, memory and depression status in middle-aged and elderly Chinese twins, representing the world's largest and most rapidly aging population. The sample consisted of 384 twin pairs with a median age of 50 years. Cognitive function was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale; memory was assessed using the revised Wechsler Adult Intelligence scale; depression symptomatology was evaluated by the self-reported 30-item Geriatric Depression (GDS-30)scale. Both univariate and multivariate twin models were fitted to the three phenotypes with full and nested models and compared to select the best fitting models. Univariate analysis showed moderate-to-high genetic influences with heritability 0.44 for cognition and 0.56 for memory. Multivariate analysis by the reduced Cholesky model estimated significant genetic (rG = 0.69) and unique environmental (rE = 0.25) correlation between cognitive ability and memory. The model also estimated weak but significant inverse genetic correlation for depression with cognition (-0.31) and memory (-0.28). No significant unique environmental correlation was found for depression with other two phenotypes. In conclusion, there can be a common genetic architecture for cognitive ability and memory that weakly correlates with depression symptomatology, but in the opposite direction. "
"25575807","The relationship between the degree of cognitive impairment and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness.","The goal of the present study is to investigate the relationship between the degree of cognitive impairment and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness which is measured by the optical coherence tomography (OCT). Thirty-five patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 35 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 35 healthy volunteers, between the ages of 60-87, who were examined in the neurology outpatient clinic among 2012-2013 were prospectively involved in our study. Mini mental state examination (MMSE) test, montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA), and also neuropsychological test batteries were used for the neurocognitive evaluation. RNFL thickness was measured by the OCT technique and the differences among groups were studied. The relationship between RNFL thickness and MMSE scores with demographic characteristics was investigated. RNFL thickness was significantly lower in AD and MCI groups compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.01). No significant differences of RNFL were found between the MCI and the AD groups (p &gt; 0.05). Significant correlation was found between MMSE scores and the RNFL values (p &lt; 0.05). Significant thinning in RNFL along with age was detected (p &lt; 0.05). In our study, it is thought that retinal nerve fiber degeneration and central nervous system degeneration may be concurrent according to the thinning of RNFL measured by OCT in AD and MCI groups.

We evaluated the MoCA's test performance by educational groups among older Singaporean Chinese adults.METHOD: The MoCA and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were evaluated in two independent studies (clinic-based sample and community-based sample) of MCI and normal cognition (NC) controls, using receiver operating characteristic curve analyses: area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity (Sn), and specificity (Sp).RESULTS: The MoCA modestly discriminated MCI from NC in both study samples (AUC = 0.63 and 0.65): Sn = 0.64 and Sp = 0.36 at a cut-off of 28/29 in the clinic-based sample, and Sn = 0.65 and Sp = 0.55 at a cut-off of 22/23 in the community-based sample. The MoCA's test performance was least satisfactory in the highest (&gt;6 years) education group: AUC = 0.50 (p = 0.98), Sn = 0.54, and Sp = 0.51 at a cut-off of 27/28. Overall, the MoCA's test performance was not better than that of the MMSE. In multivariate analyses controlling for age and gender, MCI diagnosis was associated with a &lt;1-point decrement in MoCA score (<U+03B7>(2) = 0.010), but lower (1-6 years) and no education was associated with a 3- to 5-point decrement (<U+03B7>(2) = 0.115 and <U+03B7>(2) = 0.162, respectively).CONCLUSION: The MoCA's ability to discriminate MCI from NC was modest in this Chinese population, because it was far more sensitive to the effect of education than MCI diagnosis."
"25560276","Evaluating the relationship between education level and cognitive impairment with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test.","BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is defined as 'a cognitive decline greater than that expected for an individual's age and education level but that does not interfere notably with activities of daily life'. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a screening test for MCI.METHODS: We investigated the performance of the Turkish version of the MoCA in detecting MCI among elderly persons in a rural area, the majority of whom have a low level of education. We evaluated 50 consecutive men referred from an outpatient clinic. Educational level was divided into three categories: group 1, less than primary (&lt;5 years); group 2, primary (5 years); group 3, more than primary (&gt;5 years). We evaluated the effect of education on MoCA scores and compared subjects' test performance among the different categories of education level.RESULTS: A total of 50 male patients with MCI (mean age: 70.74 ± 7.87) met the inclusion criteria. There were no differences in the total scores based on education or in the subscores for visuospatial/executive function, naming, attention, abstraction and delayed recall. Language was the only domain that showed significant differences between the groups. In post-hoc analysis, differences were found between groups 1 and 3 and between groups 1 and 2. Group 1 had significantly lower scores for language. The repeat subscore for language was significantly lower in group 1 than in group 2. In fluency, there were significant differences between groups 2 and 3 and between group 1 and 3.CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the applicability of the Turkish version of MoCA in populations with little education. Our results emphasize the need to adapt the language sections of this test, so it can be easily used in populations with low education levels."

All patients had a single depressive episode of mild severity. Diagnosis of affective and cognitive impairment was carried out using clinical and neuropsychological methods (the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the night sleep questionnaire developed by A.M. Vein, the Mini-mental state examination (MMSE), the modified Mini-Cog method, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA), the Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI-S, CGI-I) to assess the degree and dynamics of the disease, the Patient Global Impression (PGI) scale. The survey had been performed after 2,4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Agomelatine (valdoxan) was used 1 time per day in the evening in a dose of 25 mg (1 tablet).RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Agomelatine improved sleep from the second week of treatment, reduced anxiety symptoms after six weeks and depressive symptoms after eight weeks. The improvement of cognitive functions was noted as well. No side-effects was observed. The results revealed the high antidepressive activity of the drug in treatment of mild depressive states in patients with chronic brain ischemia, the balanced spectrum of effects on anxiety, depression, insomnia, the positive effect on cognitive functions that allows to recommend agomelatine in treatment of patients with CBI."

"28005183","Altered Gray Matter Volume in Stable Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease with Subclinical Cognitive Impairment: an Exploratory Study.","Gray matter volume deficits have been identified in cognitively impaired patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, it remains unknown whether the gray matter volume is altered in COPD patients with subclinical cognitive impairment. To determine whether any gray matter abnormalities are present in these patients, neuropsychological tests and structural MRI data were analyzed from 60 patients with COPD and 60 age-, gender-, education-, and handedness-matched normal controls (NCs). The COPD patients had similar Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores compared with the NCs. However, they had reduced Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores for visuospatial and executive and naming and memory functions (P &lt; 0.001). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis revealed that the COPD patients had significantly lowered gray matter volumes in several brain regions, including the left precuneus (PrCU), bilateral calcarine (CAL), right superior temporal gyrus/middle temporal gyrus (STG/MTG), bilateral fusiform gyrus (FG), and right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) (P &lt; 0.01, corrected). Importantly, the forced vital capacity (FVC) was found to be associated with the gray matter volume in the calcarine. The present study confirmed that brain structural changes were present in stable COPD patients with subclinical cognitive impairment. These findings may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of COPD."
"27992895","Is the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test better suited than the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) detection among people aged over 60? Meta-analysis.","OBJECTIVES: Screening tests play a crucial role in dementia diagnostics, thus they should be very sensitive for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) assessment. Nowadays, the MiniMental State Examination (MMSE) is the most commonly used scale in cognitive function evaluation, albeit it is claimed to be imprecise for MCI detection. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), was created as an alternative method for MMSE. Aim. MoCA vs. MMSE credibility assessment in detecting MCI, while taking into consideration the sensitivity and specificity by cut-off points.METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out by the authors using EBSCO host Web, Wiley Online Library, Springer Link, Science Direct and Medline databases. The following medical subject headings were used in the search: mild cognitive impairment, mini-mental state examination, Montreal cognitive assessment, diagnostics value. Papers which met inclusion and exclusion criteria were chosen to be included in this review. At the end, for the evaluation of MoCA 20, and MMSE 13 studies were qualified. Research credibility was established by computing weighted arithmetic mean, where weight is defined as population for which the result of sensitivity and specificity for the cut-off point was achieved. The cut-offs are shown as ROC curve and accuracy of diagnosis for MoCA and MMSE was calculated as the area under the curve (AUC).RESULTS: ROC curve analysis for MoCA demonstrated that MCI best detection can be achieved with a cut-off point of 24/25 (n = 9350, the sensitivity of 80.48% and specificity of 81.19%). AUC was 0.846 (95% CI 0.823-0.868). For MMSE, it turned out that more important cut-off was of 27/28 (n = 882, 66.34% sensitivity and specificity of 72.94%). AUC was 0.736 (95% CI 0.718-0.767).CONCLUSIONS: MoCA test better meets the criteria for screening tests for the detection of MCI among patients over 60 years of age than MMSE."

The objective of the present study was to explore the associations of MetS and its individual components with the risks of cognitive impairment and neurological dysfunction in patients after acute stroke.METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 840 patients ranging in age from 53 to 89 years from the Tianjin area of North China. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination. Neuropsychiatric behavior was assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire. Emotional state was examined according to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and neuromotor function was evaluated using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Barthel index, and the Activity of Daily Living test. After overnight fasting, blood samples were obtained to measure biochemistry indicators.RESULTS: MetS and its individual components were closely correlated with MoCA score. MetS patients had high levels of inflammation and a 3.542-fold increased odds ratio (OR) for cognitive impairment [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.972-6.361]. Of the individual MetS components, central obesity (OR 3.039; 95% CI: 1.839-5.023), high fasting plasma glucose (OR 1.915; 95% CI: 1.016-3.607), and type 2 diabetes (OR 2.241; 95% CI: 1.630-3.081) were associated with an increased incidence of cognitive impairment.

Subjects completed iTMT, using a wearable sensor attached to the leg, which translates the motion of the ankle into a human-machine interface. iTMT tests included reaching to 5 indexed circles on a computer screen by moving the ankle-joint while standing. iTMT was quantified by the time required to reach all circles in the correct sequence. Three iTMT tests were designed, including numbers (1-5) positioned in a fixed (iTMTfixed) or random (iTMTrandom) order, or numbers (1-3) and letters (A and B) positioned in random order (iTMTnumber-letter). Each test was repeated twice to examine test-retest reliability. In addition, the conventional trail-making task (TMT A and B), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and dual-task cost (DTC: gait-speed difference between walking alone and walking while counting backward) were used as references. Re sults: Good-to-excellent reliability was achieved for all iTMT tests (intraclass correlation [ICC] = 0.742-0.836). Between-group difference was more pronounced, when using iTMTnumber-letter, with average completion time of 26.3 ± 12.4, 37.8 ± 14.1, and 61.8 ± 34.1 s, respectively, for healthy, aMCI, and AD groups (p = 0.006). Pairwise comparison suggested strong effect sizes between AD and healthy (Cohen's d = 1.384, p = 0.001) and between aMCI and AD (d = 0.923, p = 0.028). Significant correlation was observed when comparing iTMTnumber-letter with MoCA (r = -0.598, p = 0.001), TMT A (r = 0.519, p = 0.006), TMT B (r = 0.666, p &lt; 0.001), and DTC (r = 0.713, p &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated proof of concept of a simple, safe, and practical iTMT system with promising results to identify cognitive and dual-task ability impairment among older adults, including those with aMCI and AD. Future studies need to confirm these observations in larger samples, as well as iTMT's ability to track motor-cognitive decline over time."

We translated Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) into Finnish and compared it with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Mini-Cog, and clock-drawing tests prior to and 3 months after the surgery. The ability to perform activities of daily living, depression, quality of life, and years of education were evaluated.CONCLUSION: The prevalence of cognitive impairment among older patients presenting for arthroplasty is high and mostly undiagnosed. It is feasible to use the MoCA to identify cognitive impairment preoperatively in this group. The clock-drawing test was abnormal in all patients with postoperative delirium, which could be used as a screening test. Higher education predicted survival on a 5-year follow-up period."
"27839916","Lack of association between LRRK2 G2385R and cognitive dysfunction in Korean patients with Parkinson's disease.","Aside from the glucocerebrosidase gene, the genetic risk factors for cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD) are controversial. We investigated whether the G2385R polymorphism in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2), a risk variant for the development of PD in East Asians, is associated with cognitive dysfunction in PD. We recruited 299 PD patients, consisting of 23 carriers and 276 non-carriers of LRRK2 G2385R, from 14 centers. Global cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). PD with cognitive dysfunction was defined as an MMSE Z score that, adjusting for age at study entry and years of education, was below -1.0 standard deviations. In multivariate analysis, PD duration, age at study entry and depression were significant risk factors for cognitive dysfunction as assessed by MMSE performance or the MoCA. In linear regression analysis of the association between MMSE Z scores and PD duration, there was no significant difference associated with the LRRK2 G2385R genotype. The interaction terms between PD duration and the LRRK2 G2385R genotype were not significant for the MMSE Z score but were significant for the MoCA. In conclusion, the LRRK2 G2385R genotype may not be associated with cognitive dysfunction in PD."

The aim of this study was to illuminate the prevalence and clinical correlates of VHs in the Chinese population with PD.METHODS: A total of 371 consecutive, idiopathic PD patients were recruited into the study. Patients were categorized as hallucinators and nonhallucinators according to Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS).RESULTS: VHs were observed in 72 (19.4%) patients. Among them, 26.4% of the hallucinators experienced minor hallucinations, and 73.6% had complex visual hallucinations. The age, disease duration, percentage of patients using dopamine agonists, UPDRS part III, Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) stage, and Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire (NMS-Quest) score in hallucinators were significantly greater than in nonhallucinators (P&lt;0.05). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) and PD Sleep Scale (PDSS) scores in nonhallucinators were significantly higher than in hallucinators (P&lt;0.05). The Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) scores were not different between the hallucinators and nonhallucinators. The forward binary logistic regression model showed that disease duration, dopamine agonist use, sleep quality, and cognition were associated with VHs in PD patients.CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the high prevalence of VHs in patients with PD. The VHs are associated with duration, dopamine agonist use, sleep quality, and cognition, and should trigger further inquiry by neurologists."

"26845223","Determining appropriate screening tools and cut-points for cognitive impairment in an elderly Chinese sample.","The establishment of normative data and screening cut-points for cognitive tasks is important to ensure the effective and timely detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). These need to be culturally relevant and account for known factors that impact on cognition such as age, education, and gender. In this study, 1,068 elderly Chinese residents of Shanghai completed a comprehensive series of cognitive tasks as part of a community screening study with 1027 meeting criteria for analysis, age M(SD) = 72.54 (8.40). MCI was detected in 267 individuals, AD in 50, and 710 had normal cognition. Receiver Operator Characteristic curve analysis indicated that the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) best differentiated normal cognition from MCI and AD. We present suggested cut-points to differentiate between normal cognition and MCI and AD for the total sample, and when split according to education levels, age, and gender. Trends suggest that the MoCA was better suited to detecting MCI, and the MMSE was better for detecting AD. For younger and more educated participants, only a slight impairment was necessary to meet screening criteria, while a larger impairment was necessary for older and less educated participants. Both tasks had a high negative predictive values for MCI and AD, and variable positive predictive values. The cut-points presented can be used to inform future work using the MMSE and MoCA to screen for MCI and AD in older Chinese people. (PsycINFO Database Record"

Age- and sex-matched non-stroke control subjects who had performed MMSE (but not MoCA) were recruited from the longitudinal population study &quot;Good Ageing in Skåne.&quot; The odds of having cognitive impairment for stroke survivors compared to controls were examined with logistic regression analyses adjusting for education.RESULTS: Of 145 stroke survivors after 10 years, 127 participated. MMSE showed PSCI in 46%, whereas MoCA displayed PSCI in 61%. Among the stroke survivors with MoCA&lt;25, 35% had MMSE=27 (P&lt;.001). The odds of having severe cognitive impairment defined as MMSE&lt;23 were higher among the stroke survivors compared to 354 controls (education-adjusted; OR=2.5; P=.004).CONCLUSIONS: Post-stroke cognitive impairment was prevalent among 10-year stroke survivors, and the odds of having severe cognitive impairment were higher among the stroke survivors compared to non-stroke persons. The burden of long-term PSCI might have been underestimated previously, and MoCA may be more suitable than MMSE to detect long-term PSCI."
"27798938","Cognitive Impairment in Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease: The Canadian Frailty Observation and Interventions Trial.","BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than one third of older adults, and is a strong risk factor for vascular disease and cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment can have detrimental effects on the quality of life through decreased treatment adherence and poor nutrition and results in increased costs of care and early mortality. Though widely studied in hemodialysis populations, little is known about cognitive impairment in patients with pre-dialysis CKD.METHODS: Multicenter, cross-sectional, prospective cohort study including 385 patients with CKD stages G4-G5. Cognitive function was measured with a validated tool called the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as part of a comprehensive frailty assessment in the Canadian Frailty Observation and Interventions Trial. Cognitive impairment was defined as a MoCA score of =24. We determined the prevalence and risk factors for cognitive impairment in patients with CKD stages G4-G5, not on dialysis.RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty seven participants (61%) with CKD stages G4-G5 had cognitive impairment at baseline assessment. When compared to a control group, this population scored lower in all domains of cognition, with the most pronounced deficits observed in recall, attention, and visual/executive function (p &lt; 0.01 for all comparisons). Older age, recent history of falls and history of stroke were independently associated with cognitive impairment.CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered a high rate of unrecognized cognitive impairment in an advanced CKD population. This impairment is global, affecting all aspects of cognition and is likely vascular in nature. The longitudinal trajectory of cognitive function and its effect on dialysis decision-making and outcomes deserves further study."
"27772789","Neuropsychiatric characteristics of GBA-associated Parkinson disease.","Mutations in GBA1 are a well-established risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD). GBA-associated PD (GBA-PD) may have a higher burden of nonmotor symptoms than idiopathic PD (IPD). We sought to characterize the relationship between GBA-PD and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Subjects were screened for common GBA1 mutations. GBA-PD (n=31) and non-carrier (IPD; n=55) scores were compared on the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI). In univariate comparisons, GBA-PD had a greater prevalence of depression (33.3%) versus IPD (13.2%) (p&lt;0.05). In regression models controlling for age, sex, disease duration, motor disability, and MoCA score, GBA-PD had an increased odds of depression (OR 3.66, 95% CI 1.13-11.8) (p=0.03). Post-hoc analysis stratified by sex showed that, among men, GBA-PD had a higher burden of trait anxiety and depression than IPD; this finding was sustained in multivariate models. Among women, GBA-PD did not confer greater psychiatric morbidity than IPD. These results suggest that GBA1 mutations confer greater risk of neuropsychiatric morbidity in PD, and that sex may affect this association."

"27733822","The Facilitative Effect of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Visuospatial Working Memory in Patients with Diabetic Polyneuropathy: A Pre-post Sham-Controlled Study.","Diabetes mellitus can lead to diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) and cognitive deficits that manifest as peripheral and central neuropathy, respectively. In this study we investigated the relationship between visuospatial working memory (VSWM) capacity and DPN severity, and attempted to improve VSWM in DPN patients via the use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Sixteen DPN patients and 16 age- and education-matched healthy control subjects received Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) for baseline cognitive assessment. A forward- and backward-recall computerized Corsi block tapping task (CBT), both with and without a concurrent motor interference task was used to measure VSWM capacity. Each DPN patient underwent a pre-treatment CBT, followed by tDCS or sham treatment, then a post-treatment CBT on two separate days. We found that although patients with severe DPN (Dyck's grade 2a or 2b) showed comparable general intelligence scores on WAIS-IV as their age- and education-matched healthy counterparts, they nonetheless showed mild cognitive impairment (MCI) on MOCA and working memory deficit on digit-span test of WAIS-IV. Furthermore, patients' peripheral nerve conduction velocity (NCV) was positively correlated with their VSWM span in the most difficult CBT condition that involved backward-recall with motor interference such that patients with worse NCV also had lower VSWM span. Most importantly, anodal tDCS over the right DLPFC was able to improve low-performing patients' VSWM span to be on par with the high-performers, thereby eliminating the correlation between NCV and VSWM. In summary, these findings suggest that (1) MCI and severe peripheral neuropathy can coexist with unequal severity in diabetic patients, (2) the positive correlation of VSWM and NCV suggests a link between peripheral and central neuropathies, and (3) anodal tDCS over the right DLPFC can improve DPN patients' VSWM, particularly for the low-performing patients."

"27698013","Relationships Between Older Drivers' Cognitive Abilities as Assessed on the MoCA and Glance Patterns During Visual-Manual Radio Tuning While Driving.","OBJECTIVE: Research has established that long off-road glances increase crash risk, and other work has shown increased off-road glance behavior in older drivers. This study investigated the relationship between older drivers' (M = 66.3, range 61-69 years) cognitive abilities and the duration of off-road glances while engaged in secondary visual-manual activities.METHOD: Twenty-two drivers completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) prior to driving an instrumented vehicle and completing a set of radio-tuning tasks. Glance behavior was recorded and manually coded into 7 glance regions (toward the forward roadway, instrument cluster, center stack, rearview mirror, left, right, and other).RESULTS: On average, older drivers with higher MoCA scores used shorter glances and glanced away from the forward roadway for less total time when manually tuning the radio.DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that lower MoCA scores may represent a driving force behind the &quot;age&quot; differences reported in earlier studies of off-road glance behavior. Questions are raised concerning the identification of MoCA scores that might be used as inclusion cut-points in driving research and in identifying individuals needing further evaluation related to suitability for continuance of driving."

Processing speed and executive cognitive functions were further evaluated with the digit-symbol substitution test (DSST), Trail Making Tests (TMT), and verbal fluency tests at the same time points. Cognitive decline (CD) was determined by changes in mean scores and as a rate using practice-corrected reliable change index (RCI).RESULTS: The baseline mean total MoCA score was 22.71 ± 3.84. Twenty patients (39.2%) were considered cognitively impaired using a cutoff of &lt;23 of 30 points. Mean total MoCA score improved at short-term post-TAVR and remained stable at 1 year (p = 0.022). On the basis of the RCI of total MoCA score, 4 patients (7.8%) presented with short-term CD, which persisted at 1 year in 1 patient (2.0%). Four patients (7.8%) exhibited cognitive improvement at 1 year, increasing to 15% among those with baseline cognitive impairment. No significant changes were observed over time in the mean DSST, TMT, and verbal fluency test scores. On the basis of the RCI, 10 of 40 patients (25%) presented with a reduction in performance of at least 1 test at 30 days that persisted at 1 year in 4 patients (10%).CONCLUSIONS: TAVR was associated with global improvement in cognitive status, more pronounced among those with cognitive impairment pre-TAVR. However, early decline in some complex cognitive functions was observed in one-quarter of TAVR recipients, persisting at 1 year in 10% of patients."

Changes in proprioception may contribute to postural instability in individuals with neurological disorders. Objectives. Evaluate proprioception in the lower limbs of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and the association between proprioception and cognitive ability, motor symptoms, postural instability, and disease severity. Methods. This is a cross-sectional, controlled study that evaluated proprioception in PD patients and healthy age- and sex-matched individuals. Kinetic postural proprioception of the knee was evaluated using an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex® Multi-Joint System 4 Pro). Participants were evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Hoehn and Yahr rating scale and postural instability (pull test and stabilometric analysis), and motor function (UPDRS-III) tests. Results. A total of 40 individuals were enrolled in the study: 20 PD patients and 20 healthy controls (CG). The PD patients had higher angular errors on the proprioceptive ratings than the CG participants (p = 0.002). Oscillations of the center of pressure (p = 0.002) were higher in individuals with PD than in the controls. Proprioceptive errors in the PD patients were associated with the presence of tremors as the dominant symptom and more impaired motor performance. Conclusion. These findings show that individuals with PD have proprioceptive deficits, which are related to decreased cognitive ability and impaired motor symptoms. "

The SORL1 methylation ratios of the above three groups were compared statistically. Next, we investigated the correlation between the DNA methylation status and the clinical presentation of diabetes with or without cognitive impairment (MCI and NMCI groups).RESULTS: The methylation ratio (86.9%) of MCI patients was significantly higher than that in the NMCI patients (35.9%, P&lt;0.05) and in the NC group (11.3%, P&lt;0.05). Moreover, the diabetic patients with methylation alleles had greater ages, longer diabetes duration, lower MOCA scores and higher plasma amyloid Aß 1-42 levels than those with unmethylation alleles (P&lt;0.05).CONCLUSION: These results suggested that the DNA methylation of the SORL1 5'-flanking region may significantly influence the manifestation of mild cognitive impairment in T2DM, and might be associated with its neurocognitive presentation."

Moreover, the rare polypharmacy cut-offs were all but one arbitrarily determined.OBJECTIVE: Studying relationships between polypharmacy and both mobility and cognitive impairments, and statistically determining a cut-off point in the number of medicinal molecule beyond which polypharmacy has deleterious consequences with respect to mobility and cognitive impairment.METHODS: We enrolled 113 community-dwelling adults aged 55 years and older with a fall history, with or without injury, in the previous year. We carefully collected information about daily medicinal molecules taken. We assessed basic mobility and global cognition with the Time-Up-and-Go and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test, respectively (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02292316).RESULTS: Timed-Up and Go test and MoCA scores were both significantly correlated with the number of molecule, used. Receiver Operating Characteristic curves indicate, with high prediction (p &lt; 0.002), that daily consumption of five or more molecules is associated with risk for both impaired mobility and global cognition. These relationships were independent of the number of comorbidities and of the pharmacological class.CONCLUSION: Community-dwelling adults aged 55 years and older who take five or more daily medicinal molecules are at high risk for both mobility and cognitive impairments. Physicians and patients should be aware of these new findings, especially when there are multiple prescribers involved in the care of the patient."
"27625048","Normative Data for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in Middle-Aged and Elderly Quebec-French People.","OBJECTIVE: Given that aging is associated with higher risk of cognitive decline and dementia, improving early detection of cognitive impairment has become a research and clinical priority. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a screening instrument used to assess different aspects of cognition. Despite its widespread use, norms adjusted to the sociodemographics of Quebec-French people are not yet available. Such norms are however important because performance on neuropsychological tests varies according to sociodemographic variables including age, sex, and education. As such, the present study aimed to establish normative data for the MoCA in middle-aged and elderly Quebec-French population.METHOD: For that purpose, 1,019 community-dwelling older adults aged between 41 and 98 were recruited. Participants from 12 recruiting sites completed the MoCA. Regression-based normative data were produced and cross-validated with a validation sample (n = 200).CONCLUSIONS: This study provides normative data for the MoCA test in the middle-aged and elderly French-Quebec people. These data will facilitate more accurate detection and follow-up of the risk of cognitive impairment in this population, taking into account culture, age, education, and sex."

MMSE (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.526, P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001), MoCA (r<U+2009>= -0.216, P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001), and NPI (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.403, P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) scores were correlated with non-HDL-C levels. High non-HDL-C levels were an independent risk factor for cognitive disorders after acute ischemic stroke (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.034, odds ratio<U+2009>=<U+2009>3.115, 95 % confidence interval: 1.088-8.917).CONCLUSIONS: High serum non-HDL-C levels, age, education, homocysteine levels, and HAMD score were independent risk factors of cognitive impairment in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The risk of cognitive disorders after acute ischemic stroke increased with increasing non-HDL-C levels. This parameter is easy to assess in the clinical setting."

"27479248","Vulnerabilities in Older Patients when Cancer Treatment is Initiated: Does a Cognitive Impairment Impact the Two-Year Survival?","INTRODUCTION: Dementia is a known predictor of shorter survival times in older cancer patients. However, no empirical evidence is available to determine how much a cognitive impairment shortens survival in older patients when cancer treatment is initiated.PURPOSE: To longitudinally investigate how much a cognitive impairment detected at the initiation of cancer treatment influences survival of older patients during a two-year follow-up duration and to compare the predictive value of a cognitive impairment on patients survival with the predictive value of other vulnerabilities associated with older age.METHODS: Three hundred and fifty-seven consecutive patients (=65 years old) admitted for breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer surgeries were prospectively recruited. A cognitive impairment was assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA&lt;26). Socio-demographic, disease-related, and geriatric vulnerabilities were assessed using validated tools. Univariate and subsequent multivariate Cox proportional hazards models stratified for diagnosis (breast/prostate cancer versus colorectal cancer) and disease status (metastatic versus non-metastatic) were used.RESULTS: A cognitive impairment was detected in 46% (n = 163) of patients. Survival was significantly influenced by a cognitive impairment (HR = 6.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.07-18.09; p = 0.001), a loss in instrumental autonomy (IADL =7) (HR = 3.06; 95% CI = 1.31-7.11; p = 0.009) and fatigue (Mob-T&lt;5) (HR = 5.98; 95% CI = 2.47-14.44; p &lt;0.001).CONCLUSIONS: During the two years following cancer treatment initiation, older patients with a cognitive impairment were up to six times more likely to die than patients without. Older patients should be screened for cognitive impairments at cancer treatment initiation to enable interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality. Further studies should address processes underlying the relationship between cognitive impairments and an increased risk of dying in older cancer patients."

We prospectively recruited 30 men with moderate-severe OSAHS diagnosed by polysomnography, and 30 healthy controls with matched gender, age and education level. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was administered to determine cognitive impairment. Plasma sSema4D levels were measured. Among the total of 60 study patients, the overall plasma sSema4D level was 7.81 ± 1.91 ng/ml. Plasma sSema4D level in OSAHS group was significantly higher than that in controls (8.92 ± 1.79 vs 6.70 ± 1.28 ng/ml, p &lt; 0.001). In OSAHS subgroup, patients with cognition impairment (CI) had higher plasma sSema4D level (10.50 ± 1.16 vs 8.00 ± 1.41 ng/ml, p &lt; 0.001) and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) (48.1 ± 14.0 vs 30.3 ± 9.2, p &lt; 0.001) than those in non-CI group.

"29465890","[The effect of anesthesia on cognitive functions].","Aim of the study - General anesthetics, arterial hypotension and hypoxia developing during anesthesia may result in impaired memory and a decline in other abilities (such as attention, concentration, linguistic and writing abilities). Our aim was to detect changes in cognitive functions due to surgery and anesthesia with controlled arterial hypotension. Materials and methods - We studied combined and intravenous anesthesia detecting pre-and postoperative cognitive functions, intraoperative haemodynamic parameters, demographic data, other data of case history and surgical data. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment test was applied in the randomized, prospective study. The preoperative data served as basis for comparison. The second test was performed following surgery when patients were fully awake. Both groups included 30 patients. Results and conclusion - After both narcosis methods (postoperative second hour) cognitive functions were significantly deteriorated (p&lt;0.05). Median MoCA before sevoflurane anesthesia was 24 points (interquartile range: 22-25), postoperative value was 20 (19-21) (p&lt;0.05). Median MoCA before propofol anesthesia was 24 points (23-26), postoperative value was 20 (18-22) (p&lt;0.01). Intraoperative arterial blood pressure, pulse rate and oxygen saturation values did not correlate with worsening of cognitive function (Pearson correlation coefficient values between -0.19 and 0.42). Execution is influenced by age (negative correlation) and education (positive correlation).Bevezetés - Az irodalmi adatok szerint az általános anesztéziában alkalmazott gyógyszerek, a narkózis alatti hipotenzió, következményes agyi hypoperfusio és hypoxia okai lehetnek a megváltozott memóriának és egyéb készségeknek (figyelem, koncentráció, nyelvi és írásbeli képességek). Kontrollált hipotenzió létrehozásával végzett mutétek elott és után vizsgáltuk a kognitív funkciókat. Módszer - Kombinált és intravénás anesztézia pre- és posztoperatív kognitív teszteredményeit hasonlítottuk össze, emellett vizsgáltuk az intraoperatív hemodinamikai paraméterek, a demográfiai és egyéb anamnesztikus adatok, a mutéti ido esetleges kapcsolatát a kognitív változásokkal. A randomizált, prospektív vizsgálat során a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) magyar fordítású tesztjeit használtuk. A viszonyítási alap a mutét elotti elso teszt eredménye volt. A második, kontrolltesztet mutét után vettük fel, amikor a betegek már teljesen tudatuknál voltak. A két csoportban 30-30 beteg adatait dolgoztuk fel. Eredmények és következtetés - Mindkét altatási forma után (a posztoperatív második órában) a kognitív funkciók szignifikánsan rosszabbak voltak (p&lt;0,05).

"27458374","Upper-Extremity Dual-Task Function: An Innovative Method to Assess Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults.","BACKGROUND: Difficulties in orchestrating simultaneous tasks (i.e., dual-tasking) have been associated with cognitive impairments in older adults. Gait tests have been commonly used as the motor task component for dual-task assessments; however, many older adults have mobility impairments or there is a lack of space in busy clinical settings. We assessed an upper-extremity function (UEF) test as an alternative motor task to study the dual-task motor performance in older adults.METHODS: Older adults (=65 years) were recruited, and cognitive ability was measured using the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA). Participants performed repetitive elbow flexion with their maximum pace, once single-task, and once while counting backward by one (dual-task). Single- and dual-task gait tests were also performed with normal speed. Three-dimensional kinematics was measured both from upper-extremity and lower-extremity using wearable sensors to determine UEF and gait parameters. Parameters were compared between the cognitively impaired and healthy groups using analysis of variance tests, while controlling for age, gender, and body mass index (BMI). Correlations between UEF and gait parameters for dual-task and dual-task cost were assessed using linear regression models.RESULTS: Sixty-seven older adults were recruited (age = 83 ± 10 years). Based on MoCA, 10 (15%) were cognitively impaired. While no significant differences were observed in the single-task condition, within the dual-task condition, the cognitively impaired group showed significantly less arm flexion speed (62%, d = 1.51, p = 0.02) and range of motion (27%, d = 0.93, p = 0.04), and higher speed variability (88%, d = 1.82, p &lt; 0.0001) compared to the cognitively intact group, when adjusted with age, gender, and BMI. Significant correlations were observed between UEF speed parameters and gait stride velocity for dual-task condition (r = 0.55, p &lt; 0.0001) and dual-task cost (r = 0.28, p = 0.03).CONCLUSION: We introduced a novel test for assessing dual-task performance in older adults that lasts 20 s and is based on upper-extremity function. Our results confirm significant associations between upper-extremity speed, range of motion, and speed variability with both the MoCA score and the gait performance within the dual-task condition."
"27448517","Apathy in multiple sclerosis: gender matters.","Apathy has been recognized as a frequent symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS) but uncertainty remains about its prevalence and clinical correlates. Therefore, the objective of this work was to assess the prevalence of apathy in patients with MS and to identify clinical and demographic correlates. A case-control study with 30 patients and 30 healthy controls matched for age, gender and education was performed. Apathy diagnosis was established using Robert et al.'s criteria. Additionally, apathy was assessed using the 10-item short version of the clinical-rated Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-C-10). The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were used to evaluate depression, fatigue and cognitive impairment, respectively. Apathy prevalence in MS patients was 43.3%. Patients with MS had higher AES-C-10 scores than controls (13.9 vs. 12.0, p=0.015). Patients with apathy presented a higher proportion of males (53.8% vs. 11.8%, p=0.02), lower educational level (53.8% vs. 11.8% of patients with up to 9years of education), higher scores on cognitive dimension of MFIS (18.0 vs. 8.0, p=0.048) and BDI (13.0 vs. 7.0, p=0.035) and worse performance on MoCA (24.0 vs. 26.0, p=0.028). Gender was the only independent predictor of apathy, with men presenting a higher risk compared to women (OR: 9.62; 95%CI: 1.02-90.61; p=0.048). In conclusion, apathy is a common neuropsychiatric disorder in MS and it is probably underdiagnosed. Male patients seem to have an increased risk of apathy, and this finding may be related to the generally more unfavorable course of MS in men."

The study was performed at two trial sites. We studied 136 outpatients with cognitive decline. MRI was performed using a magnetic field of 1.5 and 3 T. Neuropsychological assessment included Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale (MoCA), Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-R), Cambridge Cognitive Examination battery (CAMCOG) (Part 3), Clock Drawing Test, fluency test and the visual memory test (SCT). CSF was examined for standard parameters such as tau, phosphorylated tau, amyloid-ß 1-40 and 42 and Qalbumin, in accordance with established protocols and genotype. In 61 patients (45 %), at least 1 CMB was found. Most of the CMBs were described in the amnestic profile (67 %). In 86 % of the cases, multiple CMB were observed. The ratio of Aß1-40/42 in non-amnestic patients with CMB was significantly lower (mean 0.6) than in patients without CMB (mean 1.2). A notable difference in the albumin ratio as an indicator of the BBB was observed between groups with and without CMB. In the CMP-positive group, the E2 genotype was observed more frequently, and the E4 genotype less frequently, than in the CMB-negative group. Based on the cerebrospinal fluid-serum albumin ratio, we were able to show that patients with CMB present several features of BBB dysfunction. According to logistic regression, the predictive factors for CMB in patients with cognitive decline were age, WMHs score and albumin ratio. We found a significant reduction in the Aß-amyloid ratio in the non-amnestic profile group with CMB (particularly in the cortical region) in comparison to those without CMB. While this is an interesting finding, its significance needs to be assessed in a prospective follow-up. "

"27338260","How age affects memory task performance in clinically normal hearing persons.","The main objective of this study is to investigate memory task performance in different age groups, irrespective of hearing status. Data are collected on a short-term memory task (WAIS-III Digit Span forward) and two working memory tasks (WAIS-III Digit Span backward and the Reading Span Test). The tasks are administered to young (20-30 years, n = 56), middle-aged (50-60 years, n = 47), and older participants (70-80 years, n = 16) with normal hearing thresholds. All participants have passed a cognitive screening task (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)). Young participants perform significantly better than middle-aged participants, while middle-aged and older participants perform similarly on the three memory tasks. Our data show that older clinically normal hearing persons perform equally well on the memory tasks as middle-aged persons. However, even under optimal conditions of preserved sensory processing, changes in memory performance occur. Based on our data, these changes set in before middle age."

In this multicenter observational study, MMSE and MoCA were administered in a random order to 130 patients: 35 MSA, 30 PSP and 65 age, and education and gender matched-PD. We assessed between-group differences for MMSE, MoCA, and their subitems. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated. The mean MMSE was higher than the mean MoCA score in each MSA (27.7 ± 2.4 vs. 22.9 ± 3.0, p &lt; 0.0001), PSP (26.0 ± 2.9 vs. 18.2 ± 3.9, p &lt; 0.0001), and PD (27.3 ± 2.0 vs. 22.3 ± 3.5, p &lt; 0.0001). MoCA total score as well as its letter fluency subitem differentiated PSP from MSA and PD with high specificity and moderate sensitivity. More specifically, a cut-off score of 7 F-words or less per minute would support a diagnosis of PSP (PSP vs. PD: 86 % specificity, 70 % sensitivity; PSP vs. MSA: 71 % specificity, 70 % sensitivity). By contrast, MMSE presented an overall ceiling effect for most subitems, except for the pentagon scores, where PSP did less well than MSA or PD patients. These preliminary results suggest that PSP and MSA, similar to PD patients, may present normal MMSE and reduced MoCA performance. Overall, MoCA is more sensitive than MMSE in detecting cognitive impairment in atypical parkinsonism and together with verbal fluency would be a useful test to support PSP diagnosis."

Participants were classified as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or cognitively intact at follow-up based on multidisciplinary consensus. We excluded 33 participants who endorsed cognitive complaints at baseline. The MCI group ( n = 53) showed a significant decrease in MoCA scores ( M = -1.83, p &lt; .001, d = 0.64). When accounting for age and education, the MCI group showed a decline of 1.7 points, while cognitively intact participants remained stable. Using Reliable Change Indices established by cognitively intact group, 42% of MCI participants demonstrated a decline in MoCA scores. Results suggest that the MoCA can detect cognitive change in MCI over a 3.5-year period and preliminarily supports the utility of the MoCA as a repeatable brief cognitive screening measure."

"27288815","Self-reported physical activity in essential tremor: Relationship with tremor, balance, and cognitive function.","BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity may be the result of medical comorbidities. Inactivity itself may also lead to important health consequences, especially in older patients. Essential tremor (ET) patients may have a variety of physical and cognitive problems that could detrimentally impact on level of physical activity. Yet, to our knowledge, there have been no studies of physical activity in these patients.METHODS: Self-reported physical activity was assessed using the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) in 100 ET cases (mean age 80.5years) enrolled in a clinical study. Additional clinical measures were the total tremor score, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) score and number of steps taken off of the straight line during tandem gait (a measure of balance).RESULTS: Lower PASE score was associated with older age, more tandem gait difficulty, higher total tremor score and lower MOCA score (all p&lt;0.05). In a linear regression model that included total tremor score, MOCA score, number of steps off of the straight line during tandem gait, and age, higher total tremor score (p=0.046) and more steps off of the straight line during tandem gait (p=0.014) were independently associated with reductions in physical activity.CONCLUSIONS: Several of the motor features of ET (tremor and imbalance) are independently associated with reductions in level of physical activity."
"27288781","Cognitive study on Chinese patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder.","AIMS: We investigated cognitive abnormalities using standard tests in Chinese patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) compared with those in normal controls.METHODS: Twenty-three patients with iRBD and 23 normal controls were included in this study. All of the participants underwent one night of video-polysomnography (PSG) monitoring to certify REM sleep without atonia or abnormal behaviors. The cognitive assessments were administered and scored according to a standard procedure, including global cognitive screening and attention/processing speed, executive function, memory, language, and visuospatial ability testing.RESULTS: Patients with iRBD had similar scores of the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) but lower Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores compared with controls (p&gt;0.05, p=0.013). The iRBD patients performed poorly on verbal memory tests, which included immediate recall (p&lt;0.001), delayed recall (p&lt;0.001), and false recognitions (p=0.002) of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). The visual memory and visuospatial abilities were also impaired in iRBD patients, as reflected by the copy (p=0.005) and immediate (p=0.004) and delayed (p=0.003) recall of the Rey-Osterrieth complex figure, although no difference was found after Bonferroni correction. The duration of RBD was 6.98±8.10years. After controlling for age, the duration of RBD was only correlated with the Trail Making Test B (r=0.613, p=0.045) and block design (r=-0.667, p=0.025).CONCLUSIONS: Impaired verbal memory was observed in iRBD patients who identified as Chinese. MoCA could detect cognitive abnormalities and serve as a screening scale. The present study further confirmed cognitive deficits in iRBD as an early clinical marker in the prodromal stage of synucleinopathy."
"27274387","The Association between Frailty and Cognition in Elderly Women.","BACKGROUND: Frailty refers to the loss of physiologic complexity and the associated decline in ability to withstand stressors as one gets older. It is defined as unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, weakness, slow walking speed, and low physical activity. According to several western studies, frailty is associated with cognitive impairment, but there have been few studies about the relationship between frailty and cognitive impairment in Korea. Thus, the purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between cognition and factors related to frailty such as grip strength, walking speed, physical activity, and depression, among female patients older than 65 in Korea.METHODS: A total of 121 subjects among the outpatients of the department of family medicine at Kangbuk Samsung Hospital who did not meet the exclusion criteria were included in this study. We divided the participants into 2 groups, according to the Korean version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score: 1 group with subjects that had normal cognition and the other group with patients that had impaired cognition. A comparison was made between the 2 groups in regards to the factors related to frailty, and we completed equation that predicting cognition from the frailty related factors.RESULTS: Compared with the impaired cognition group, the subjects in the normal cognition group had higher hand strength, and walked faster (P&lt;0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in physical activity between the 2 groups (P=0.19). When multiple linear regression analysis was performed using age, grip strength, and walking speed as the predictor variables and MoCA score as the dependent variable, the regression coefficients were calculated to be: -0.2015, 0.2294, 1.2372, and -0.1436, respectively (P&lt;0.05).CONCLUSION: In Korean female patients who are older than 65 years of age, cognition tends to decline as grip strength decreases, walking speed gets slower, depression becomes more severe, and as age increases."

We correlated game performance against a number of standard assessments, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM).RESULTS: After a series of modifications, the game could be used by a wide range of elderly patients in the emergency department demonstrating its feasibility for use with these users. Of 146 patients, 141 (96.6%) consented to participate and played our serious game. Refusals to play the game were typically due to concerns of family members rather than unwillingness of the patient to play the game. Performance on the serious game correlated significantly with the MoCA (r=-.339, P &lt;.001) and MMSE (r=-.558, P &lt;.001), and correlated (point-biserial correlation) with the CAM (r=.565, P &lt;.001) and with other cognitive assessments.CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrates the feasibility of using serious games in a clinical setting.

Furthermore, we investigated the relationship with affective and clinical variables, in addition to ECAS usability and patients' insight into cognitive/behaviour changes. Finally, correlations between genetic and cognitive/behavioural data were analysed. We recruited 107 patients with ALS. Normative data were collected on 248 healthy subjects. Participants were administered the ECAS and two standard cognitive screening tools (FAB, MoCA), two psychological questionnaires (BDI, STAI/Y) and an ad hoc usability questionnaire. The FBI was also carried out with caregivers. Results showed that the ECAS Italian version discriminated well between patients and controls. The most prevalent deficit occurred in executive functions and fluency. Correlations were observed between the ECAS and standard cognitive screening tools and between the ECAS carer interview and the FBI, supporting its full convergent validity. In conclusion, the ECAS Italian version provides clinicians with a rapid, feasible and sensitive tool, useful to identify different profiles of cognitive-behavioural impairment in ALS."

Brief and sensitive screening tools are needed. We evaluated the accuracy of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) compared to the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) to detect cognitive impairment in HIV-infected participants.METHOD: HIV-infected patients were consecutively enrolled during routine outpatient visits at a single institution. The MoCA, the MMSE, and a comprehensive neuropsychological battery were administered. Patients were considered as affected by cognitive impairment if they showed decreased cognitive function in at least two ability domains based on age and education adjusted Italian normative cut-offs.RESULTS: Ninety-three HIV-infected participants (75% males, median age 47, all on antiretroviral therapy; 90% HIV-RNA &lt;50copies/mL, median CD4 644 cells/µL) were enrolled. Thirteen participants (14%) were diagnosed as cognitively compromised via a comprehensive neuropsychological examination. The area under the curve of the adjusted MMSE and MoCA scores to detect cognitive impairment were .51 (95% CI = .31-.72, p = .877) and .70 (95% CI = .53-.86, p = .025), respectively. A MoCA score &lt;22 was able to predict the cognitive impairment with 62% of sensitivity and 76% of specificity.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that the prognostic performance of the MoCA to detect cognitive impairment among mildly impaired HIV-infected participants was only moderate. Further investigations are needed to identify optimal cognitive tests to screen HIV-infected individuals or to explore whether a combination of cognitive tests might represent a viable alternative to a single screening tool."

"27156658","Introducing a new age-and-cognition-sensitive measurement for assessing spatial orientation using a landmark-less virtual reality navigational task.","Age-related impairments during spatial navigation have been widely reported in egocentric and allocentric paradigms. However, the effect of age on more specific navigational components such as the ability to drive or update directional information has not received enough attention. In this study we investigated the effect of age on spatial updating of a visual target after a series of whole-body rotations and transitions using a novel landmark-less virtual reality (VR) environment. Moreover, a significant number of previous studies focused on measures susceptible to a general decline in motor skills such as the spent time navigating, the distance traversed. The current paper proposes a new compound spatial measure to assess navigational performance, examines its reliability and compares its power with those of the measures of duration and traversed distance in predicting participants' age and cognitive groups assessed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores. Using data from 319 adults (20-83 years), our results confirm the reliability, the age sensitivity, and the cognitive validity of the designed spatial measure as well as its superiority to the measures of duration and traversed distance in predicting age and MoCA score. In addition, the results show the significant effect of age cognitive status on spatial updating."

"27092858","Correlative factors of cognitive dysfunction in PD patients: a cross-sectional study from Southwest China.","BACKGROUND: Cognitive dysfunction is common in Parkinson's disease (PD). A comprehensive understanding of cognitive dysfunction and its correlative factors in Chinese PD patients were not available.METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 454 PD patients. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Non-motor symptoms were assessed using the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), and depression and anxiety were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, respectively.RESULTS: Cognitive dysfunction was observed in 58.1% of the patients. The mean age, age of onset, scores of rigidity, bradykinesia, axial impairment, tremor, speech and facial expression, total Unified PD Rating Scale part III and H&amp;Y stage, and NMSS scores were significantly higher in PD patients with cognitive dysfunction than in those without cognitive dysfunction. The prevalence of sleep/fatigue domain with the item 'difficulty falling asleep', mood/apathy domain with the item 'feelings of nervousness', perceptual problems/hallucinations domain with the item 'delusions', attention/memory domain with the items 'concentration' and 'forget to do things', gastrointestinal domain with the items 'dribbling saliva' and 'swallowing', urinary domain with the item 'nocturia', and the item 'taste or smell' in the miscellaneous domain were significantly higher in PD patients with cognitive dysfunction. Logistic regression indicated that female sex, older age, lower education level, higher bradykinesia score, and presence of the urinary domain were associated with cognitive dysfunction in PD.CONCLUSIONS: Age, sex, education level, bradykinesia score, and presence of urinary symptoms are correlative factors of cognitive dysfunction in Chinese PD patients."
"27063610","Identifying Prevalence and Risk Factors for Mild Cognitive Impairment in Adults Presenting for Urological Evaluation.","OBJECTIVE: To examine mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in a young and older adult urology population, and which external factors were associated with diminished cognitive status at baseline.METHODS: We enrolled patients &gt;18 years of age presenting to a large, urban tertiary care center for a wide variety of urologic complaints. Cognitive status was determined by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) screening test. A score of 26-30 on the MoCA is considered cognitively intact, whereas &lt;26 indicates MCI. Patient charts were retrospectively reviewed; a backwards-stepwise logistic regression was constructed to compare MCI with potential risk factors.RESULTS: One hundred ninety-seven patients were included. There were 10/33 (30%) patients aged 18-40 who had MCI. Moreover, 32/68 (47%) patients aged 41-64 had MCI. Of older adults age 65+, MCI was seen in 65/96 (68%) patients. Factors associated with MCI in age group 41-64 included opioid use. Patients with stone disease were less likely to demonstrate MCI, when compared to other general categories of urologic chief complaints. For patients in age group 65+, associations with MCI included a cancer-related chief complaint, increased age, depressive symptoms, and less education. There were no significant associations with MCI in age group 18-40.CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate a significant prevalence of MCI in an adult urology population and factors that may be associated with its prevalence. We believe that this study lays the groundwork for urology providers to be able to identify patients who may have MCI at baseline."
"27062418","The Impact of Falls on Motor and Cognitive Recovery after Discharge from In-Patient Stroke Rehabilitation.","BACKGROUND: Falls are common among community-dwelling stroke survivors. The aims of this study were (1) to compare motor and cognitive outcomes between individuals who fell in the 6 months' postdischarge from in-patient stroke rehabilitation and those who did not fall, and (2) to explore potential mechanisms underlying the relationship between falls and recovery of motor and cognitive function.METHODS: Secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of individuals discharged home from in-patient rehabilitation was conducted. Participants were recruited at discharge and completed a 6-month falls monitoring period using postcards with follow-up. Nonfallers and fallers were compared at the 6-month follow-up assessment on the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment (CMSA), gait speed, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Measures of balance confidence and physical activity were also assessed.RESULTS: Twenty-three fallers were matched to 23 nonfallers on age and functional balance scores at discharge. A total of 43 falls were reported during the study period (8 participants fell more than once). At follow-up, BBS scores (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.0066) and CMSA foot scores (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.0033) were significantly lower for fallers than for nonfallers. The 2 groups did not differ on CMSA leg scores (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.049), gait speed (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.47), or MoCA score (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.23). There was no significant association between change in balance confidence scores and change in physical activity levels among all participants from the first and third questionnaire (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>.27, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.08).CONCLUSIONS: Performance in balance and motor recovery of the foot were compromised in fallers when compared to nonfallers at 6 months post discharge from in-patient stroke rehabilitation."

"27051070","Cognitive Function as a Mediator in the Relationship Between Physical Activity and Depression Status in Older Adults.","Previous research has found that increased physical activity may provide a protective effect on depression status; however, these studies do not account for cognitive function. This study's aim was to determine whether cognitive function mediates the association between physical activity depression status in older adults. Data from 501 older adults were used for this analysis. Physical activity had a significant protective effect on depression (OR = 0.761, 95% CI [0.65, 0.89], p = .001). Adjusted analysis yielded an attenuated association (OR = 0.81, 95% CI [0.69, 0.95], p = .01) with a significant interaction for physical activity and cognitive function (OR = 0.991, 95% CI [0.985, 0.997], p = .005). MoCA performance also had a significant mediating effect on the relationship between physical activity and depression status (p = .04). These findings suggest that cognitive function is associated with, and does mediate, the relationship between physical activity and depression status."
"27049878","The effectiveness of unitization in mitigating age-related relational learning impairments depends on existing cognitive status.","Binding relations among items in the transverse patterning (TP) task is dependent on the integrity of the hippocampus and its extended network. Older adults have impaired TP learning, corresponding to age-related reductions in hippocampal volumes. Unitization is a training strategy that can mitigate TP impairments in amnesia by reducing reliance on hippocampal-dependent relational binding and increasing reliance on fused representations. Here we examined whether healthy older adults and those showing early signs of cognitive decline would also benefit from unitization. Although both groups of older adults had neuropsychological performance within the healthy range, their TP learning differed both under standard and unitized training conditions. Healthy older adults with impaired TP learning under standard training benefited from unitized training. Older adults who failed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) showed greater impairments under standard conditions, and showed no evidence of improvement with unitization. These individuals' failures to benefit from unitization may be a consequence of early deficits not seen in older adults who pass the MoCA."
"27049362","Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) screening mild cognitive impairment in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) pre-dialysis.","INTRODUCTION: Individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at higher risk of developing cognitive impairment (CI), initially mild (MCI), potentially identifiable, but still poorly diagnosed and treated. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has been indicated for MCI screening in CKD.OBJECTIVE: To assess MCI in patients with CKD not yet on dialysis.METHODS: Study conducted in 72 non-elderly subjects with pre-dialysis CKD. The neuropsychological assessment included: The global cognitive assessment test MoCA; the clock drawing (CD); the digit span forward (DSF) and reverse (DSR); phonemic verbal (VF) fluency (FAS) and semantics (animals); the fist-edge-palm (FEP); and the memory 10 pictures.RESULTS: The average age of the participants was 56.74 ± 7.63 years, with predominance of male sex (55.6%), mainly with = 4 years of education (84.3%), with CKD cathegories 1, 2 and 3a and 3b (67.6%), hypertension (93.1%) and diabetes mellitus (52.1%). MCI (MoCA = 24) was observed in 73.6% of the patients. We did not find association among MCI with demographic and clinical variables, but a tendency to association with age (p = 0.07), educational level (p= 0.06) and diabetes (0.06). The executive function tests CD, DS-reverse and FEP, individually were able to identify CI with good sensibility and negative predictive value compared to MoCA and together, showed the same capability to identify MCI when compared to MoCA.CONCLUSION: The MCI is common in non-elderly patients with CKD not yet on dialysis. Together, the CD, DSR and FEP showed similar performance in identify MCI in this population when compared to MoCA, suggesting impairment of executive functions."
"27048925","Associations between the Brief Memory and Executive Test (BMET), Activities of Daily Living, and Quality of Life in Patients with Cerebral Small Vessel Disease.","OBJECTIVES: In addition to neuropsychological difficulties, patients with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) can have reduced activities of daily living and a poorer quality of life compared to healthy adults. The Brief Memory and Executive Test (BMET), is a cognitive screening tool designed to be sensitive to the neuropsychological profile of patients with SVD. While the BMET is sensitive to the cognitive consequences of SVD, it is unclear how well scores on this measure relate to functional outcomes. The aims of this study are to investigate the relationship between scores on the BMET and functional outcomes (activities of daily living and quality of life) in SVD, and to compare this with other commonly used cognitive screening tools.METHODS: This study included 184 participants with SVD (mean age=63.2; SD=9.9) and 299 healthy controls (mean age=62.4; SD=13.8) who were tested using the BMET, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Stroke Specific - Quality of Life Scale (SS-QoL), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and measures of both instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and basic activities of daily living (BADL).RESULTS: After controlling for covariates the scores on the BMET, but not the MoCA or MMSE, were significantly related to poorer IADL and quality of life in the SVD group. In addition to the BMET scores, symptoms of depression were found to be significant associated with functional outcome.CONCLUSION: These results support the clinical utility of using of the BMET, in combination with a standardized depression questionnaire, during the early assessment of patients with SVD."

We examined the role of the systemic inflammatory response, measured by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) assay, and the effect of CPAP treatment on hsCRP and cognitive impairment in patients with OSAHS.METHODS: Eligible subjects (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>178) were categorized into two groups: absent or mild OSAHS, and moderate to severe OSAHS. First, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and serum hsCRP concentration were measured. Then, the moderate to severe OSAHS group was further divided into a conservative treatment subgroup (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>68) and a CPAP subgroup (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>68). After 6 months of treatment, MoCA scores and hsCRP concentrations were re-measured in the moderate to severe group.RESULTS: Compared with the absent or mild OSAHS group, hsCRP concentration was higher (1.00<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.28 mg/L versus 2.71<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.8, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) and MoCA scores were significantly lower (27.4<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.4 versus 26.3<U+2009>±<U+2009>2.0, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) in the moderate to severe group. After adjustment for age, education, body mass index, and neck circumference, hsCRP and MoCA scores correlated with parameters of overnight hypoxia. hsCRP and the proportion of time spent with blood oxygen saturation<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>90 % (T90) predicted MoCA score. hsCRP and MoCA score improved, and the subdomains of the MoCA were partially improved, in the CPAP treatment subgroup. In conservatively managed patients, hsCRP concentration increased, and there was no improvement in neurocognitive dysfunction, with the memory subdomain significantly worse.CONCLUSIONS: hsCRP may play a role in neurocognitive dysfunction in OSAHS. Long-term CPAP treatment could normalize the serum hsCRP concentration and partially reverse cognitive dysfunction in OSAHS."
"26991388","Walking assessment after lumbar puncture in normal-pressure hydrocephalus: a delayed improvement over 3 days.","OBJECTIVE The determination of gait improvement after lumbar puncture (LP) in idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is crucial, but the best time for such an assessment is unclear. The authors determined the time course of improvement in walking after LP for single-task and dual-task walking in iNPH. METHODS In patients with iNPH, sequential recordings of gait velocity were obtained prior to LP (time point [TP]0), 1-8 hours after LP (TP1), 24 hours after LP (TP2), 48 hours after LP (TP3), and 72 hours after LP (TP4). Gait analysis was performed using a pressure-sensitive carpet (GAITRite) under 4 conditions: walking at preferred velocity (STPS), walking at maximal velocity (STMS), walking while performing serial 7 subtractions (dual-task walking with serial 7 [DTS7]), and walking while performing verbal fluency tasks (dual-task walking with verbal fluency [DTVF]). RESULTS Twenty-four patients with a mean age of 76.1 ± 7.8 years were included in this study. Objective responder status moderately coincided with the self-estimation of the patients with subjective high false-positive results (83%). The extent of improvement was greater for single-task walking than for dual-task walking (p &lt; 0.05). Significant increases in walking speed were found at TP2 for STPS (p = 0.042) and DTVF (p = 0.046) and at TP3 for STPS (p = 0.035), DTS7 (p = 0.042), and DTVF (p = 0.044). Enlargement of the ventricles (Evans Index) positively correlated with early improvement. Gait improvement at TP3 correlated with the shunt response in 18 patients. CONCLUSIONS Quantitative gait assessment in iNPH is important due to the poor self-evaluation of the patients. The maximal increase in gait velocity can be observed 24-48 hours after the LP. This time point is also best to predict the response to shunting. For dual-task paradigms, maximal improvement appears to occur later (48 to 72 hours). Assessment of gait should be performed at Day 2 or 3 after LP."
"26977126","Effectiveness of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatments on the cognitive functioning of elderly persons with mild cognitive impairment associated with white matter lesions.","BACKGROUND: Cerebral white matter lesion (WML) is a pathological change of the white matter which is considered an early sign of brain impairment in elderly individuals, so it is reasonable to administer early dementia prevention programs to individuals with WML.Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has developed several approaches to prevent or delay the onset of dementia that have, as yet, not been formally tested.AIM: Evaluate the effects of a 6-month TCM intervention for elderly persons with mild cognitive impairment and WML.METHODS: Eighty individuals 65 years of age or older with radiological evidence of WML and mild cognitive impairment based on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were classified into the four main TCM constitutional types (qi deficiency, yang deficiency, phlegm dampness, or blood stasis) and randomly assigned to a treatment group or a treatment-as-usual control group. The treatment group participated in training focused on diet, lifestyle, exercises, and emotional regulation adjustment; they also received six monthly courses of moxibustion (heating acupoints by burning the moxa of dried mugwort), each of which involved 10 daily 15-minute sessions focused on three targeted acupoints (one of which was specific to the constitutional type). Changes in the MoCA and in the score of each of the four constitutional types were the main outcomes assessed.RESULTS: Two participants dropped out of each group over the 6 months, leaving 38 in each group. Based on repeated measures analysis of variance, the total MoCA score, four of the six MoCA subscales scores (visual space and executive function, naming, attention and calculation, and delayed memory), and all four of the TCM constitution type scores showed significantly greater improvement over the 6 months in the treatment group than in the control group.CONCLUSION: This study shows that TCM interventions can improve both the cognitive functioning and the severity of symptoms considered in the TCM assessment of constitutional types among elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment and WML. Long-term follow-up studies that use blinded evaluation of the outcome are needed to determine whether or not constitution-specific TCM treatments can prevent the onset of dementia."
"26959108","Metabolic Syndrome and Cognitive Performance Among Chinese =50 Years: A Cross-Sectional Study with 3988 Participants.","BACKGROUND: To date, the relationship between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cognitive performance has not been well defined. This study aimed to explore the relationship between MetS and cognitive performance among Chinese elderly population.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed, with data collected in seven clinical centers from five provinces of Northern China. All recruited participants were =50 years of age and complained with cognitive impairment or were reported with cognitive impairment by his/her caregiver(s). MetS was diagnosed according to the criteria issued by Chinese Medical Association Diabetes Association. Cognitive function was scored by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).RESULTS: Three thousand nine hundred eighty-eight participants (in an average of 66.4<U+2009>±<U+2009>8.8 years of age, male 53.1%) were included in the analysis. Six hundred seventy-three (16.9%) participants were diagnosed with MetS, and 3013 (75.6%) participants had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (MoCA score &lt;26). There was no statistically significant difference in the MoCA scores between participants with MetS (21.0<U+2009>±<U+2009>5.4) and without MetS (21.3<U+2009>±<U+2009>5.3). In the logistic regression, after adjusting factors of age, education, marital status, smoking, and physical activity, diabetes and dyslipidemia were associated with MCI, whereas hypertension and overweight or obesity were not. Participants with diabetes had a higher risk of MCI (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.24, 95% CI: 1.03-1.50). Participants with dyslipidemia had a lower risk of MCI (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.81, 95% CI: 0.68-0.97).CONCLUSION: In our study, MetS is not associated with cognitive performance in elderly Chinese population. However, elderly Chinese with diabetes would have lower cognition function, and the dyslipidemia might be reversely associated with the cognitive function."

The relationship of cognitive function and serum level of BDNF, however is yet to be examined. The aim of this study was to examine serum BDNF levels in PD. Subsequently, the relationship of cognitive function to the serum levels of BDNF was evaluated.METHODS: Serum BDNF levels were measured in 29 idiopathic PD subjects and 30 healthy-matched controls using ELISA technique. Cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) scale.RESULTS: Serum BDNF levels and MOCA total score were significantly lower (P&lt;0.001) in PD patients versus healthy controls. MOCA total score correlated with serum BDNF (r=0.44; P=0.012) but not with age, years of education, duration of disease and severity of symptoms. The regression analysis showed that serum BDNF accounted (P=0.019) for 19% of MOCA total score variance.CONCLUSIONS: The data confirm lowered serum BDNF in PD. Additionally; it suggests that BDNF may play a role in the cognitive deficit of PD. Further studies are required to identify association of BDNF in cognitive decline with PD."
"26932385","Factors Influencing Cognitive Function in Subjects With COPD.","BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the association between cognitive function and age, pulmonary function, comorbidity index, and the 6-min walk distance in subjects with COPD as well as to compare the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in terms of their ability to identify cognitive dysfunction in subjects with COPD.METHODS: A total of 52 individuals with stable COPD were included in this study. Cognitive function was assessed using MMSE and MoCA. Age, body mass index, the Modified Cumulative Illness Rating Scale, 6-min walk distance, arterial blood gases, and pulmonary function tests were assessed and recorded.RESULTS: The range and SD of scores in subjects with COPD were larger with MoCA than with MMSE. MMSE and MoCA scores are associated with 6-min walk distance and comorbidity index in subjects with COPD. General cognitive function measured by MoCA was negatively correlated with the comorbidity index but was positively associated with 6-min walk distance in subjects with COPD after controlling for possible confounding factors in the multivariate model. However, general cognitive function measured by MMSE was not correlated with the comorbidity index and 6-min walk distance in subjects with COPD, after controlling for possible confounding factors in the multivariate model.CONCLUSIONS: MoCA may be a more reliable screening test than MMSE in detecting cognitive impairment in subjects with COPD. The addition of cognitive tests on assessment of subjects with COPD can provide further benefit."
"26903584","Validating a Pragmatic Approach to Cognitive Screening in Stroke Prevention Clinics Using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is used commonly to identify cognitive impairment (CI), but there are multiple published cut points for normal and abnormal. We seek to validate a pragmatic approach to screening for moderate-severe CI, by classifying patients into high-, intermediate-, and low-risk categories.METHODS: A total of 390 participants attending an academic Stroke Prevention Clinic completed the MoCA and more detailed neuropsychological testing. Between April 23, 2012 and April 30, 2014, all consecutive new referrals to the regional Stroke Prevention Clinic who were English-speaking, not severely aphasic, and could see and write well enough to complete neuropsychological testing were assessed for inclusion, and consenting patients were enrolled. CI was defined as =2 SDs below normal for age and education on at least 2 cognitive subtests. A single cut point for CI was compared with 2 cut points (high sensitivity and high specificity) generated using receiver operator characteristic and area under the curve analyses. The intermediate-risk group contained those scoring between the 2 cut points.RESULTS: Thirty-four percent of participants had a symptomatic or silent stroke, 34% were seen for possible or probable transient ischemic attack, and 32% were diagnosed with other vascular or nonvascular conditions. Using a single cut point, sensitivity and specificity were optimal with MoCA =22, (sensitivity=60.4%, specificity=89.9%, area under the curve=0.801, positive predictive value=48.5%, negative predictive value=93.5%, positive likelihood ratio=6, and negative likelihood ratio=0.4). Using 2 cut points, sensitivity was optimal with MoCA =28 (sensitivity=96.2%, negative predictive value =97.6%, and negative likelihood ratio=1.27), and specificity was optimal with MoCA =22 (specificity=89.9%, positive predictive value=48.5%, and positive likelihood ratio=6).CONCLUSIONS: Stratifying participants into 3 categories facilitates the identification of a homogenous group at low risk for CI, as well as 2 other groups with intermediate and higher risk. This approach could facilitate clinical care pathways and patient selection for research."

A control group consisted of 25 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers. Fractional anisotropy (FA) of several WM regions was analyzed by diffusion tensor imaging scan. Plasma CML levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and cognitive function was assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA).RESULTS: The total Mini-Mental State Examination score in the patient group (25.72±3.13) was significantly lower than the control group (28.16±2.45) (p&lt;0.05). In addition, the total MoCA score in the patient group (22.15±3.56) was significantly lower than the control group 25.63±4.12) (p&lt;0.01). In the patient group, FA values were significantly decreased in the corpus callosum, cingulate fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, parietal WM, hippocampus, and temporal lobes relative to corresponding regions of healthy controls (p&lt;0.05). Plasma CML level was negatively correlated with average FA values in the global brain (r=-0.58, p&lt;0.01) and MoCA scores (r=-0.47, p&lt;0.05).CONCLUSIONS: In T2DM, WM microstructure changes occur in older patients, and elevations in CML may play a role in the development of cognitive impairment."
"26886083","Brain Microvasculature Involvement in ANCA Positive Vasculitis.","OBJECTIVE: Endothelial dysfunction is associated with arterial stiffness, a factor that is increasingly recognised as an important determinant of cardiovascular risk. High-flow organs such as the brain and kidneys are particularly sensitive to excessive pressure and flow pulsatility. High, local blood flow is associated with low microvascular impedance, which facilitates the penetration of excessive pulsatile energy into the microvascular bed leading to tissue damage. Systemic endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness have been demonstrated in peripheral vessels in associated vasculitis (AAV). Although, the brain involvement is not infrequent in AAV, it has not been evaluated previously. Our aim is to evaluate the involvement of the brain microvasculature in AAV.METHODS: Twenty-three patients with inactive AAV were studied. Brain blood flow was assessed by transcranial Doppler (TCD) and single-photon positron emission tomography (SPECT), structural brain involvement by brain MRI and cognitive scores by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test.RESULTS: Lower mean flow velocity (MFV) was associated to altered SPECT perfusion, higher white matter changes (WMC), lower MoCA scores and younger age (p &lt; 0.05). Middle cerebral artery pulsatility index (MCA-PI) was related to hypertension, diabetes, lower scores on MoCA, increased vasculitis damage index (VDI) and perfusion impairment in SPECT (p &lt; 0.05). These data were reproduced for all intracranial arteries. Up to 88.9% of patients had WMC on MRI. A higher lesion load was associated with age, decreased MoCA and fewer MFV with higher PI. The multivariable linear regression analysis showed that the greater the lesion loads, greater the bifrontal atrophy, MCA-PI and lower MoCA scores. Up to 60.9% of patients presented a decreased MoCA score (p = 0.012). It appeared to be related to VDI (p = 0.04), WMC (p = 0.004) and altered SPECT (p = 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The alterations in brain perfusion SPECT, the presence of white matter lesions on MRI, as well as increased PI and RI with lower MFV of the cerebral vessels in TCD suggest the presence of microangiopathy in asymptomatic AAV that could lead to cognitive impairment."
"26883012","Correlates of depressive symptoms in individuals attending outpatient stroke clinics.","Background and purpose Depressive symptoms are common post-stroke. We examined stroke deficits and lifestyle factors that are independent predictors for depressive symptomology. Methods A retrospective chart review was performed for patients' post-stroke who attended outpatient clinics at a hospital in Southwestern Ontario between 1 January 2014 and 30 September 2014. Demographic variables, stroke deficits, secondary stroke risk factors and disability study measures [Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)] were analyzed. Results Of the 221 outpatients who attended the stroke clinics (53% male; mean age<U+2009>=<U+2009>65.2<U+2009>±<U+2009>14.9 years; mean time post-stroke 14.6<U+2009>±<U+2009>20.1 months), 202 patients were used in the final analysis. About 36% of patients (mean<U+2009>=<U+2009>5.17<U+2009>±<U+2009>5.96) reported mild to severe depressive symptoms (PHQ-9<U+2009>=<U+2009>5). Cognitive impairment (CI), smoking, pain and therapy enrollment (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01) were significantly associated with depressive symptoms. Patients reporting CI were 4 times more likely to score highly on the PHQ-9 than those who did not report CI (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.72). While controlling for age, MoCA scores negatively related to depressive symptoms with higher PHQ-9 scores associated with lower MoCA scores (r=<U+2009>-0.39, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.005). Conclusions High levels of depressive symptoms are common in the chronic phase post-stroke and were partially related to cognition, pain, therapy enrollment and lifestyle factors. Implications for Rehabilitation Stroke patients who report cognitive deficits, pain, tobacco use or being enrolled in therapy may experience increased depressive symptoms. A holistic perspective of disease and lifestyle factors should be considered while assessing risk of depressive symptoms in stroke patients. Patients at risk for depressive symptoms should be monitored at subsequent outpatient visits."
"26880907","Subjective Memory Complaint and Depressive Symptoms among Older Adults in Portugal.","Background. Older adults report subjective memory complaints (SMCs) but whether these are related to depression remains controversial. In this study we investigated the relationship between the SMCs and depression and their predictors in a sample of old adults. Methods. This cross-sectional study enrolled 620 participants aged 55 to 96 years (74.04 ± 10.41). Outcome measures included a sociodemographic and clinical questionnaire, a SMC scale (QSM), a Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), a Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), and a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Results. The QSM mean total score for the main results suggests that SMCs are higher in old adults with depressed symptoms, comparatively to nondepressed old adults. The GDS scores were positively associated with QSM but negatively associated with education, MMSE, and MoCA. GDS scores predicted almost 63.4% of variance. Scores on QSM and MoCA are significantly predicted by depression symptomatology. Conclusion. Depression symptoms, lower education level, and older age may be crucial to the comprehension of SMCs. The present study suggested that depression might play a role in the SMCs of the older adults and its treatment should be considered. "
"26852137","MMSE and MoCA in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies: a multicenter 1-year follow-up study.","The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) are the most commonly used scales to test cognitive impairment in Lewy body disease (LBD), but there is no consensus on which is best suited to assess cognition in clinical practice and most sensitive to cognitive decline. Retrospective cohort study of 265 LBD patients [Parkinson's disease (PD) without dementia (PDnD, N = 197), PD with dementia (PDD, N = 40), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, N = 28)] from an international consortium who completed both the MMSE and MoCA at baseline and 1-year follow-up (N = 153). Percentage of relative standard deviation (RSD%) at baseline was the measure of inter-individual variance, and estimation of change (Cohen's d) over time was calculated. RSD% for the MoCA (21 %) was greater than for the MMSE (13 %) (p = 0.03) in the whole group. This difference was significant only in PDnD (11 vs. 5 %, p &lt; 0.01), but not in PDD (30 vs. 19 %, p = 0.37) or DLB (15 vs. 14 %, p = 0.78). In contrast, the 1-year estimation of change did not differ between the two tests in any of the groups (Cohen's effect &lt;0.20 in each group). MMSE and MoCA are equal in measuring the rate of cognitive changes over time in LBD. However, in PDnD, the MoCA is a better measure of cognitive status as it lacks both ceiling and floor effects."

The two groups were matched for age, sex, education, and vascular risk factors. All the subjects underwent the scans of conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), DTI and neuropsychological assessment. The values of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured within white matter lesions (WML) and normal appearing white matter (NAWM). Three regions of interest (ROIs) were located in the white matter of centrum semiovale, anterior periventricular white matter and posterior periventricular white matter. The relationships between the cognitive function and the abnormalities of DTI parameters were analyzed.RESULTS: (1) Patients with LA performed significantly worse cognitive function, especially in the fields of executive function. The results of our study showed that patients with LA were associated with comprehensive cognitive function deficits, including mini mental state examination (MMSE) (24.4 ± 3.2 vs 28.3 ± 1.2), montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) (21.2 ± 3.4 vs 25.7 ± 1.7), Stroop B (69.2 ± 13.5 vs 43.3 ± 5.0), Stroop C (141.2 ± 42.6 vs 64. 8 ± 10.0), Stroop (C-B) (72.0 ± 41.9 vs 21.5 ± 9.4), trail making test (TMT)-A (73.4 ± 15.4 vs 31.1 ± 7.1), TMT-B (126.2 ± 17.5 vs 81.4 ± 5.7), digit symbol test (25.2 ± 5 .4 vs 36.7 ± 5.1) (all P&lt;0.05). (2) The values of FA were lower, and MD were higher in WML than NAWM and controls in all the three ROIs (P&lt;0.05). The values of FA in NAWM located in centrum semiovale and posterior periventricular white matter were lower than controls (P&lt;0.05). The values of MD in NAWM located in anterior periventricular white matter were higher than controls (P&lt;0.05). (3) The values of FA of NAWM located in anterior periventricular correlated inversely with the Z scores of executive function (r=-0.311, P=0.04).CONCLUSIONS: Patients with LA are related with significant cognitive impairment, especially in the domains of executive dysfunction. Microstructural integrity of both white matter lesions and NAWM is associated with executive function. The underlying executive dysfunction in LA may attribute to the damage of the prefrontal-subcortical circle."

The information including gender, age, illness duration, years of education and Hoehn &amp; Yahr (H-Y) stage were recorded. Cognition function of all the patients with PD and the controls were measured by using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale. Plasma levels of catalase (CAT), total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), total glutathione (T-GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured by ELISA . Then we compared and analyzed the results.RESULTS: Plasma levels of CAT, T-SOD and T-GSH in PD group were significantly lower than the control group [(159 ± 9) kU/L vs (170 ± 5) kU/L, P&lt; 0.01; (97 ± 24) kU/L vs (124 ± 25) kU/L, P&lt;0.01; (17 ± 10) µmol/L vs (60 ± 51) µmol/L, P&lt; 0.01]. Plasma levels of CAT, T-GSH, GSH-Px and MDA were no differences between early PD group (H-Y stage I-II) and middle-late PD group (H-Y stage III or higher) of patients (P&gt;0.05). Plasma levels of T-GSH in PD group with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were obviously lower than PD group without MCI [(14 ± 7) µmol/L vs (19 ± 11) µmol/L, P&lt; 0.05].

The present study investigates that whether miR-132 is altered in circulating blood serum samples of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) patients.METHODS: We collected samples from 39 subjects with PSCI, 37 subjects with post-stroke cognitive normality (PSCN), and 38 age-matched controls (AMC) for which ages, gender and education level were matched. MiR-132 was detected using a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method. To test the predictive value of miR-132 for PSCI, prediction capabilities were compared using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under curve (AUC) analysis.RESULTS: The level of miR-132 in PSCI patient serum was significantly elevated compared to that of PSCN and AMC subjects. The ROC curve showed that miR-132 achieved an AUC of 0.961 (p&lt;0.0001). Importantly, the miR-132 level was correlated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score in PSCI patients.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that there was a substantial correlation between serum miR-132 expression and post-stroke cognitive functionality, suggesting that miR-132 may be a risk marker for PSCI. Because of the limitations of this study, the results should be treated with caution."

We then examined the additive effect of the TRS and brief cognitive tests to improve the diagnosis of CI.METHODS: The study was conducted in 2 primary health care centers in Singapore. A total of 1082 individuals (=60 years old) were assessed for sociodemographic risk factors and their informants were administered the AD8; 309 individuals who agreed for further cognitive assessments completed the Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and a neuropsychological battery at a research center. Primary health care medical records were accessed for data on vascular risk factors.RESULTS: Of the 309 individuals who underwent neuropsychological evaluation, 4 were excluded due to missing medical data; 167 (54.8%) individuals had CI and 138 (45.2%) had No Cognitive Impairment (NCI). The ß coefficients were standardized to calculate risk scores. CI was significantly predicted by age &gt;70 years (odds ratio [OR] 5.99; score = 3), diabetes (OR 3.36; score = 2), stroke (OR 2.70; score = 1), female gender (OR 2.02; score = 1) and individual cognitive complaints (SCC) (OR 1.95; score = 1). The TRS had an optimal cutoff of =3 and explained considerable variance in global cognitive composite Z-scores (R(2) = 0.41, P &lt; .001). The MoCA explained substantial variance compared with the MMSE and AD8 (R(2) changes of 0.474, 0.422, and 0.157, P &lt; .001, respectively).CONCLUSION: The TRS is a reasonable measure to predict individuals at risk of CI. The addition of the MoCA, in persons with positive TRS scores, is a useful approach to improve the diagnosis of CI for at-risk patients attending primary health care."

Neoadjuvant hormonal treatment in patients with hormone receptor positive, HER-2 negative early breast cancer is proven to be an effective and safe option; it is associated with a higher rate of breast conserving surgery (BCS), may reduce the need for adjuvant chemotherapy and enables a delay of surgery for medical or practical reasons. Clinical responses range from 13% to 100% with at least 3 months of NET. Methods of assessing response should include MRI of the breast, particularly in lobular tumours. In studies comparing tamoxifen with aromatase inhibitors (AI), AI proved to be superior in terms of tumour response and rates of BCS. Change in Ki67 is accepted as a validated endpoint for comparing endocrine neoadjuvant agents. Levels of Ki67 during treatment are more closely related to long-term prognosis than pretreatment Ki67.

However, the findings are inconsistent about the preference of older adults to over/underestimate the observed interval as well as the relationship between the time estimation and the participant's cognitive status. In this study, we used a verbal estimation task for the rotation time of a virtual building (40 seconds) to assess the explicit interval timing of participants. The performance of a cohort of 250 cognitively-healthy adults and 10 Alzheimer's patients was analyzed in relation to their age and cognitive scale, measured by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score. The participants' performances were evaluated based on three measurements: Coefficient of variation (CV) for measuring stability, Absolute Error (AE) for measuring accuracy and Directional Error (DE) for measuring the degree of over/under-estimation. A significant difference was observed between the participants who overestimated the interval and those who underestimated it in terms of age, cognitive status and Absolute Error. We also found a significant effect of time estimation, with underestimation by cognitively healthy participants to mild over-estimation by 70+ year old and low-MoCA (MoCA score &lt;; 26) participants as well as severe overestimation by Alzheimer's disease patients. The result of regression analysis for predicting MoCA score based on the dependent variables (AE, DE and CV) support the superiority of Directional Error to Absolute Error and Coefficient of Variation that are commonly used in the time perception studies.

"26727602","Application and Revision of Montreal Cognitive Assessment in China's Military Retirees with Mild Cognitive Impairment.","OBJECTIVE: In an effort to accommodate MOCA to better fit for the Chinese context, this study was designed to employ the MOCA criteria to screen mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and analyze associated risk factors in military retirees.METHODS: Three hundred and four retired military cadres were recruited using a random cluster sampling technique with information collected including personal, prevalence, MOCA scale, and related neuropsychiatry scale. Thirty retirees were randomly chosen to be further analyzed one month later using the revised MOCA scale.RESULTS: <U+2460>Our data indicated an incidence rate of 64.8% for mild cognitive impairment in retired military cadres. The incidence rate for MCI was significantly higher in those aged 80 or above compared with those 80 years of age or younger (P&lt;0.05). The incidence rate of MCI was significantly higher in those with fewer than 6 years of education compared with those with over 7 years of education (P&lt;0.05). The MCI incidence was higher for those with little exercise than those taking regular exercise (P&lt;0.01). Moreover, the MCI incidence was higher in stroke patients than those who never had a stroke episode (P&lt;0.05). <U+2461>There was a significant correlation between MOCA and MMSE scale scores (r = 0.81). MOCA scale scores were negatively correlated with ADL and CES-D scores (although not PSQI scores). <U+2462> MOCA recension Cronbach's alpha value was 0.862. The related coefficient of MOCA and MOCA recension was 0.878(P&lt;0.01). When the Score of cut-off -point of the MOCA recension was 28, the area in ROC curve analyses was 0.859, as well as the largest area.CONCLUSION: Retired cadres exhibited a greater incidence of MCI (than general population), which was closely associated with age, level of education and physical exercise and cerebral apoplexy. Revised MOCA scale displays a better validity and reaction degree of reliability and is more suitable for screening and diagnosis of MCI in the elderly in China."

Patients with first-time anterior circulation TIA (diagnosed within 24 h of onset) and normal cognition, treated between August 2009 and August 2014 at the Department of Neurology of Chengdu Military General Hospital, China, were analyzed retrospectively. Patients underwent whole-brain CTPI within 1 week of TIA to detect cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean transit time (MTT) and time to peak (TTP) in the ischemic region. Based on cognitive function assessment 4 weeks after TIA, using the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and mini mental state examination, the patients were divided into control and VCI groups. CTPI parameters and other clinical data were compared between groups, and Spearman's correlation analysis used to identify associations between cognitive scores and CTPI parameters in the VCI group. 50 patients (25 per group; aged 55-72 years) were included. Patient age, gender, smoking status, alcohol consumption, educational level, time from TIA onset to admission, time from TIA onset to CTPI, and prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation and hyperhomocysteinemia did not differ between groups. Both groups showed TTP and MTT prolongation, CBF reduction, but no change in CBV in the ischemic region; these changes were significantly larger in the VCI group (P &lt; 0.05). MTT correlated negatively with MoCA score (r = -0.51, P = 0.009). CTPI could facilitate early diagnosis of VCI in patients with anterior circulation TIA. "

A cohort of people with TIA was recruited within two weeks of symptom onset. All individuals completed a robotic-based assessment of 8 behavioural tasks related to upper limb motor and proprioceptive function, as well as cognitive function. Robotic task performance was compared to a large cohort of controls without neurological impairments corrected for the influence of age. Impairment in people with TIA was defined as performance below the 5th percentile of controls. Participants with TIA were also assessed with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment (CMSA) of the arm, the Behavioural Inattention Test (BIT), the Purdue pegboard test (PPB), and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Age-related white matter change (ARWMC), prior infarction and cella-media index (CMI) were assessed from baseline CT scan that was performed within 24 hours of TIA. Acute infarction was assessed from diffusion-weighted imaging in a subset of people with TIA. Twenty-two people with TIA were assessed. Robotic assessment showed impaired upper limb motor function in 7/22 people with TIA patients and upper limb sensory impairment in 4/22 individuals. Cognitive tasks involving robotic assessment of the upper limb were completed in 13 participants, of whom 8 (61.5%) showed significant impairment. Abnormal performance in the CMSA arm inventory was present in 12/22 (54.5%) participants. ARWMC was 11.8 ± 6.4 and CMI was 5.4 ± 1.5. DWI was positive in 0 participants. Quantitative robotic assessment showed that people who have had a TIA display a spectrum of upper limb motor and sensory performance deficits as well as cognitive function deficits despite resolution of symptoms and no evidence of tissue infarction."

PD patients were administered with Non-Motor symptom questionnaire (NMSQuest), the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS-III), the Mini-Mental State Examination score (MMSE), the Hoehn-Yahr classification, the MoCA, and GDS-15. The relationship between NMS burden and PD subtypes, age, gender and disease severity were examined using linear regression models. The prevalence of each NMS among different PD motor subtypes was analyzed using x2 test.RESULTS: Compared with the healthy controls, PD patients had a higher number of NMS. The prevalence of NMS in postural instability gait difficulty (PIGD) group is higher than that in tremor dominant (TD) group. There is no significant correlation between age, gender, MMSE scores, MoCA scores and the number of NMS. PD patients with higher UPDRS-III scores and a longer course of disease had a higher prevalence of NMS.CONCLUSIONS: NMS is also common in PD patients at an early stage. The PIGD group who have more axial injuries and more severe motor symptoms, have a higher risk of NMS burden than PD patients in TD group."
"29271217","[Cognitive Deficits in Cancer Patients with Haematological Malignancies].","BACKGROUND: Cognitive deficits are one of the most common adverse effects of chemotherapy (CHT). Previous reports suggest that this is due to the so-called chemo brain syndrome, the symptoms of which manifest mainly as impairments in executive functions, speed of information processing, memory, attention, and motor speed. However, empirical evidence for these manifestations is currently ambiguous.METHODS: The research group consisted of 26 cancer patients with haematological malignancies who had undergone chemotherapy treatment. Cognitive performance was measured by two screening cognitive tests, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Test (MoCA).RESULTS: MMSE detected cognitive deficits in 34.6% of patients whereas MoCA identified mild or moderate cognitive impairment in up to 80.7% of patients. The highest error rates were found in tasks focused on memory, attention, spatial orientation, executive functions, and abstraction. Cognitive deficit progressed with age, but not with duration of therapy.CONCLUSION: Deficits in cognitive functions occur in a considerable number of patients after CHT, although the diagnosis depends on the sensitivity of the detection method. Screening scales usually provide the first indication of impaired cognitive functioning and may indicate the need for further neuropsychological examination. Early diagnosis of reduced cognitive functions is a prerequisite for effective psychological intervention to help patients cope with the undesirable effects of chemotherapy treatment more quickly.Key words: chemotherapy - cognitive dysfunction - chemo brain - cognitive screening - neuropsychological tests - psychology The authors declare they have no potential conflicts of interest concerning drugs, products, or services used in the study.

According to the evaluation results of MCI, these T2DM patients were further divided into the T2DM + MCI group (n = 138) and the T2DM + NMCI group (n = 122). General data, including gender, age, disease history and body mass index (BMI), and the laboratory indexes, including serum adiponectin, fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and blood fat, were collected for statistical analysis in T2DM + MCI group, T2DM + NMCI group and healthy control group.RESULTS: Comparisons among T2DM + MCI group, T2DM + NMCI group and healthy control group, showed that the serum level of adiponectin in T2DM + MCI group was significantly lower than those in remaining two groups (p &lt; 0.01). Spearman correlation analysis revealed that score of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was positively correlated with the serum level of adiponectin (r = 0.446, p &lt; 0.01). Multivariate linear regression analysis indicated that education (standard ß = 0.325, p = 0.003), age (standard ß = -0.236, p = 0.016), disease course of hypertension (standard ß = -0.242, p = 0.006), disease course of diabetes mellitus (standard ß = -0.377, p &lt; 0.001) and the level of adiponectin were correlated with the cognitive impairment. The results of itemized assessment in MoCA scale showed that in T2DM + MCI group, the scores in visuospatial and executive abilities, attention, language and orientation were significantly lower than those in other two groups (p &lt; 0.01). As for the delayed recall, the score in T2DM + MCI group was significantly lower than those in other two groups (p &lt; 0.01), while the score in T2DM + NMCI group was lower than that in the healthy control group (p &lt; 0.01); in terms of the naming ability and abstraction, no statistically significant differences were identified among three groups (p &gt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Age, poor education, disease course of hypertension, disease course of diabetes mellitus and a low level of adiponectin in serum are the risk factors in MCI of T2DM patients.

The influence of hypertension as modifiable risk factor in the evolution of cognitive impairment is emphasized in numerous investigations. Almost all the proposed in research literature data were obtained from the investigation of old patients group, who had high indexes of blood pressure and stroke histories. Therefore, we think that it is very impotent to detect the slight and moderate cognitive impairment of hypertensive patients of working age until the expressed clinical signs appear. Objective - determine the age and hypertension duration influence on the evolution of cognitive impairments in patients with essential hypertension of the second stage. There were examined 102 patients with essential hypertension of the second stage, which had not any attendant illnesses. Their average years were about 49,84±0,83 average. Disease duration was approximately 8,78±0,60. According to the purpose of examination all patients were divided by age and disease duration into 3 groups. To study cognitive impairment used a number of neuropsychological tests. Analyzing the MoCA test data of examined patients it should be noted a tendency to decreasing of cognitive function indexes with age increasing. Thus, the patients of the first group have no cognitive impairment. But authentic lowering of MoCA test results may be noted in the patients group of 56 years and higher, up to 6,1% in comparison with the patients under 45 years. The indexes of MoCA test in the group of patients with arterial hypertension duration more than 10 years were authentically lower comparing with the group of patients with disease duration up to 5 years and patients with arterial hypertension duration of 5 to 10 years in 9,9% and in 4,9% accordantly. We have found that with increasing duration of the disease and age the working age patients with essential hypertension of the second stage, significant increase in cognitive impairment was observed. Diagnosing of cognitive impairment is the measure of prevention of dementia in future and it must be an inseparable part of system examination of hypertensive patients."

"29188578","Trajectory and variability characterization of the Montreal cognitive assessment in older adults.","BACKGROUND: The Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) has become one of the most widely used cognitive screening instruments since its initial publication. To date, only a handful of studies have explored longitudinal characteristics of the MoCA.AIM: The aim of this study is to characterize the trajectory of MoCA performance across a broad age continuum of older adults.METHODS: Data from 467 cognitively normal participants were used in this analysis. The sample was grouped into four strata based on the participants' age at baseline (60-69, 70-79, 80-89, and 90-99). Mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis and mixed-effects spline models were used to characterize the trajectory of MoCA scores in each age stratum and in the entire sample. Intrasubject standard deviation (ISD) was used to characterize the natural variability of individual MoCA performance over time.RESULTS: The ISD values for each of the age strata indicated that year-to-year individual variation on the MoCA ranged from zero to three points. MMRM analysis showed that the 60-69 stratum remained relatively stable over time while the 70-79 and 80-89 strata both showed notable decline relative to baseline performance. The mixed-effects spline model showed that MoCA performance declines linearly across the older adult age span.DISCUSSION: Among cognitively normal older adults MoCA performance remains relatively stable over time, however across the older adult age-span MoCA performance declines in a linear fashion. These results will help clinicians better understand the normal course of MoCA change in older adults while researchers may use these results to inform sample size estimates for intervention studies.CONCLUSION: This study provides an enhanced view of the MoCA's intraindividual trajectory in normal elderly aged 60 and older."
"29183843","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Basic (MoCA-B) is not a reliable screening tool for cognitive decline in HIV patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy in rural South Africa.","BACKGROUND: HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are frequently occurring comorbidities in HIV-positive patients, diagnosed by means of a neuropsychological assessment (NPA). Due to the magnitude of the HIV-positive population in Sub-Saharan Africa, easy-to-use cognitive screening tools are essential.METHODS: This was a cross-sectional clinical trial involving 44 HIV-positive patients (on stable cART) and 73 HIV-negative controls completing an NPA, the International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS), and a culturally appropriate cognitive screening tool, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Basic (MoCA-B). HAND were diagnosed by calculating Z-scores using internationally published normative data on NPA, as well as by using data from the HIV-negative group to validate the MoCA-B.RESULTS: One hundred and seventeen patients were included (25% male, median age 35 years, median 11 years of education). A moderate correlation was found between the MoCA-B and NPA total Z-score (Pearson's r=0.36, p=0.02). Area under the curve (AUC) values for MoCA-B and IHDS were 0.59 and 0.70, respectively. The prevalence of HAND in HIV-positive patients was 66% when calculating Z-scores using published normative data versus 48% when using the data from the present HIV-negative cohort.CONCLUSION: The MoCA-B appeared not to be a valid screening tool for HAND in this setting. The prevalence of HAND in this setting is high, but appeared overestimated when using published norms."
"29171956","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in a population-based sample of Turkish migrants living in Germany.","OBJECTIVES: Data on cognitive testing in migrants in Germany are scarce. We aimed to evaluate the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in Turkish migrants in Berlin and its association with demographics and health-related variables.METHOD: For this cross-sectional study, a random sample of persons with Turkish names was drawn from the registration-office. Cognitive function was assessed using the MoCA; 0 = worst, 30 = best total score. Multivariable linear regression models were calculated to determine associated factors with the total MoCA-score.RESULTS: In our analyses we included 282 participants (50% female), mean age 42.3 ± 11.9 years (mean ± standard deviation (SD)). The mean ± SD MoCA score was 23.3 ± 4.3. In the multivariable analysis, higher education (ß = 2.68; p &lt; 0.001), and chosing the German version of the MoCA (ß = -1.13; p = 0.026), were associated with higher MoCA-scores, whereas higher age (ß = -0.08; p = 0.002) was associated with lower MoCA scores.CONCLUSION: In our study, a higher educational level, lower age, and German as the preferred test language (as compared to Turkish) were positively associated with the cognitive performance of Berliners with Turkish roots. To examine neurocognitive health of migrants, longitudinal population-based and clinical cohort studies that specifically compare migrants and their descendants with the original population of their home countries are required."
"29137902","Effects of opioid medications on cognitive skills among Emergency Department patients.","INTRODUCTION: Treatment for pain and related conditions has been identified as the most common reason for Emergency Department (ED) visits. Concerns exist regarding the effects of opioid pain medications on cognition and patient ability to consent for procedures, hospital admission, or to refuse recommended medical interventions. This study was undertaken to identify cognitive skills before and after opioid pain medication in the ED setting.METHODS: This was a prospective study comparing performance on the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) before and after administration of opioid pain medications. Eligible participants included ED patients with pain, who received opioid treatment. Participants were randomized to receive either the MMSE before pain medication and the MoCA after medication, or the reverse. MoCA scores were converted to MMSE equivalent scores for comparison.RESULTS: Among 65 participants, the median age was 36 and median triage pain score was 8. 35% of patients were considered cognitively impaired based on their MMSE score prior to any opioid medication (MMSE&lt;27). There was a median decrease in pain scores of 1 point following pain medication, p-value&lt;0.001. There was a median decrease in MMSE scores of 1 point following pain medication, p-value=0.003. The range of change in scores (post minus pre) on the MMSE-equivalent was -7 to 3. 35 patients (56%) had a decrease in scores, 6 (10%) had no change, and 21 (34%) had an increase. After medication, 31 (48%) were abnormal (MMSE score&lt;27). No differences in MMSE scores were identified by gender, ethnicity, mode of arrival, insurance, age, triage pain scores, opioid agent given, or ED diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: There is an association between opioid pain medication and decrease in cognitive performance on the MMSE. Because of the wide range of cognitive performance following opioid pain medication, assessment of individual patients' cognitive function is indicated."
"29134611","Exploring white matter microstructure and olfaction dysfunction in early parkinson disease: diffusion MRI reveals new insight.","Olfaction dysfunction is considered as a robust marker of prodromal Parkinson disease (PD). Measurement of olfaction function as a screening test is unsatisfactory due to long lead time interval and low specificity for detection of PD. Use of imaging markers might yield more accurate predictive values and provide bases for combined use of imaging and clinical markers for early PD. Diffusion MRI connectometry was conducted on 85 de novo PD patients in and 36 healthy controls to find: first, white matter tracts with significant difference in quantitative anisotropy between PD groups with various degrees of olfaction dysfunction and second, second fibers with correlation with University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) score in each group using a multiple regression analysis considering age, sex, GDS and MoCA score. Local connectomes were determined in seven of all the possible comparisons, correcting for false discovery rate (FDR). PD patients with anosmia and normal olfaction had the highest number of fibers with decreased connectivity in left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, bilateral fornix, bilateral middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), bilateral cingulum, bilateral corticospinal tract (CST) and body, genu and splenium of corpus callosum (CC) (FDR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0013). In multiple regression analysis, connectivity in the body, genu and splenium of CC and bilateral fornix had significant negative correlation (FDR between 0.019 and 0.083), and bilateral cingulum and MCP had significant positive correlation (FDR between 0.022 and 0.092) with UPSIT score. White matter connectivity in healthy controls could not be predicted by UPSIT score using the same model. The results of this study provide compelling evidence that microstructural degenerative changes in these areas underlie the clinical phenotype of prodromal olfaction dysfunction in PD and that diffusion parameters of these areas might be able to serve as signature markers for early detection of PD. This is the first report that confirms a discriminative role for UPSIT score in identifying PD specific changes in white matter microstructure. Our results open a window to identify microstructural signatures of prodromal PD in white matter."

"29120490","Determination of MoCA Cutoff Score in Patients with Alcohol Use Disorders.","BACKGROUND: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score is a convenient and promising tool for estimating alcoholic patients' global cognitive functioning, a major challenge for all specialized alcohol treatment centers. However, whether or not the score should be corrected for education level and whether the proposed cutoff is relevant in patients with alcohol use disorders (AUD) should be determined.METHODS: We compared the MoCA scores in patients hospitalized for AUD with and without cognitive impairment assessed by a battery of neuropsychological (NP) tests. Sensitivity, specificity, and cutoff of the MoCA score were analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with and 25 without cognitive impairment were included in the study. There were 40 men and 16 women, with a mean age of 49.5 years. The mean uncorrected MoCA score was 23.1 ± 3.3 in those with and 27.0 ± 1.9 in those without cognitive impairment. NP tests were significantly correlated with the MoCA score. Uncorrected MoCA scores identified more than 80% of the patients with a cutoff score equal to 26, to obtain similar accuracy with the corrected score required using a cutoff score equal to 27.CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that the MoCA test is a convenient and reliable screening tool to measure cognition defects in alcoholic patients. As using the 1-point education adjustment increases the cutoff score by 1 point, it is suggested to use the noncorrected score and the usual cutoff, that is, 26. Being easy to administer and only moderately time-consuming, the MoCA score should be used extensively in addiction treatment centers."
"29119542","How do we get there? Effects of cognitive aging on route memory.","Research into the effects of cognitive aging on route navigation usually focuses on differences in learning performance. In contrast, we investigated age-related differences in route knowledge after successful route learning. One young and two groups of older adults categorized using different cut-off scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), were trained until they could correctly recall short routes. During the test phase, they were asked to recall the sequence in which landmarks were encountered (Landmark Sequence Task), the sequence of turns (Direction Sequence Task), the direction of turn at each landmark (Landmark Direction Task), and to identify the learned routes from a map perspective (Perspective Taking Task). Comparing the young participant group with the older group that scored high on the MoCA, we found effects of typical aging in learning performance and in the Direction Sequence Task. Comparing the two older groups, we found effects of early signs of atypical aging in the Landmark Direction and the Perspective Taking Tasks. We found no differences between groups in the Landmark Sequence Task. Given that participants were able to recall routes after training, these results suggest that typical and early signs of atypical aging result in differential memory deficits for aspects of route knowledge."

"29112532","Speech in Noise Perception as a Marker of Cognitive Impairment in HIV Infection.","OBJECTIVES: Human immunodeficiency virus positive (HIV+) individuals report hearing difficulties, but standard audiological tests show no, or small, changes in peripheral hearing ability. The hearing complaints may reflect central nervous system (CNS) auditory processing deficits, rather than middle or inner ear problems, and may result from CNS damage due to HIV infection or treatment. If central auditory task performance and cognitive deficits in HIV+ individuals are shown to be related, then central auditory tests might serve as a &quot;window&quot; into CNS function in these patients.DESIGN: We measured cognitive performance (Mandarin Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]) and speech in noise perception (Mandarin hearing-in-noise test [HINT]) in 166 normal-hearing HIV+ individuals (158 men, 8 women, average age 36 years) at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center in Shanghai, China. Data collection included audiometry, tympanometry, and the Amsterdam Inventory of Auditory Handicap (AIAH), which assesses the subjective ability to understand speech and localize sound.RESULTS: Subjects had no middle ear disease and met criteria for normal-hearing sensitivity (all thresholds 20 dB HL or less). A significant negative relationship between speech reception thresholds (SRT) and MoCA scores (r = 0.15, F = 28.2, p &lt; 0.001) existed. Stepwise linear regression showed that when the factors of age, MoCA scores, hearing thresholds, and education level were considered, only age and MoCA scores contributed independently to the SRT results (overall model r = 0.30, F = 38.8, p &lt; 0.001). Subjective hearing complaints from the AIAH supported the HINT results. AIAH and MoCA scores were also related (r = 0.05, F = 8.5, p = 0.004), with those with worse MoCA scores having more problems on the AIAH. When the cohort was divided into those with normal and abnormal performance on the MoCA, those with abnormal performance on the MoCA had significantly higher average SRTs (p &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Understanding speech in noise measured both objectively with the HINT and subjectively with the AIAH was inversely related to cognitive abilities despite a normal ability to hear soft sounds determined by audiometry. Although age was also an important independent factor affecting speech perception, the age relationship within the speech findings in this study may represent more than just age-related declines in speech in noise understanding. Although reliable data on disease duration are not available, the older members of this cohort likely had HIV longer and probably had more severe symptoms at presentation than the younger members because early detection and treatment of HIV in Shanghai has improved over time. Therefore, the age relationship may also include elements of disease duration and severity. Speech perception, especially in challenging listening conditions, involves cortical and subcortical centers and is a demanding neurological task. The problems interpreting speech in noise HIV+ individuals have may reflect HIV-related or HIV treatment-related, central nervous damage, suggesting that CNS complications in HIV+ individuals could potentially be diagnosed and monitored using central auditory tests."
"29111025","Orthostatic hypotension associated with executive dysfunction in mild cognitive impairment.","INTRODUCTION: Midlife hypertension is associated with dementia in longitudinal studies while chronic hypotension in the elderly is associated with dementia onset. Orthostatic hypotension could influence cognitive performance in the elderly. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between orthostatic hypotension and cognitive functions.METHODS: Consecutive participants with complete neuropsychological evaluation from a Memory Clinic were included. Orthostatic hypotension (OH) was defined by a fall=20/10mmHg systolic/diastolic pressure. Participants were classified into one of 3 groups: 1) subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), 2) mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 3) dementia. Neuropsychological tests were analyzed for patients with and without OH.RESULTS: One hundred and twenty participants were included, of which 16 (13%) were classified as SCI, 42 (35%) as MCI, and 63 (52%) with dementia. Prevalence of OH was 0% for the SCI group, 26% (n=11) for the MCI group, and 38% (n=24) for the dementia group. Age, sex, education, and brief cognitive test scores (MMSE &amp; MoCA) were not different between groups with or without OH. In the MCI group, OH was associated with lower cognitive performance in several executive functions tests: visual working memory (p&lt;0.001), processing speed (p=0.006), Stroop flexibility (p=0.030) and Trail-Making Test part B (p=0.024). There was no difference in episodic memory performance. OH was associated with a diagnosis of hypertension and the use of antihypertensive medication. No differences were observed in vascular brain injury between groups with and without OH.CONCLUSIONS: This study found that orthostatic hypotension prevalence is correlated to severity of cognitive deficits in a Memory Clinic. In MCI, OH is associated with lower performance in executive functions. OH could represent an under-recognized correlate of cognitive performance."

We tested the hypothesis that FoF is associated with lower levels of GCF (cross-sectional) and greater decline in GCF (prospective) in adults aged 50 and older.DESIGN: Observational cohort study.SETTING: The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, a population-based study.PARTICIPANTS: Data were from 4931 participants (mean age 62.9 ± 9.1, range 50-98, 54.3% female).MEASUREMENTS: FoF was based on self-report in 2010. GCF was measured with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) in 2010 and 2014. The cross-sectional association was examined using linear regression unadjusted and after adjustment for demographic and health factors. The prospective association between FoF and the odds of &gt;1-SD decline in GCF were examined using logistic regression. Interaction with age and mediation by social and physical activities were examined.RESULTS: In 2010, 21.9% of participants reported FoF. In the unadjusted cross-sectional models, those with FoF had lower scores on the MoCA (B -1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.40 to -0.90) and MMSE (B -0.52, CI -0.67 to -0.37). In the unadjusted prospective models, FoF was associated with a greater odds of decline in MoCA (odds ratio [OR] 1.60, CI 1.26-2.04) and MMSE (OR 1.64, CI 1.29-2.08). After adjustment for covariates, all associations attenuated and were no longer statistically significant, except the association with decline in MoCA (OR 1.32, CI 1.01-1.71). No statistically significant interaction with age was found (P &gt; .37). Additional adjustment for social and physical activity did not change the results.CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide weak evidence for FoF as a predictor of cognitive decline."

Even patients with normal cognition may exhibit subclinical electrophysiological dysfunction. This study aimed to evaluate visuospatial attention processing in IRBD patients with normal cognition and to compare their findings with those of age- and sex-matched healthy controls.METHODS: We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) and performance measures during a variant of the Posner task in 14 IRBD patients and 14 control subjects. Behavioral data and the mean P300 amplitude were compared between groups.RESULTS: No group difference was found for reaction time or accuracy, but a significant group effect was observed for the P300 amplitude. IRBD patients had reduced P300 amplitude (µV) than controls in both valid (IRBD: 0.53 ± 1.05 vs Controls: 1.61 ± 0.95; p = 0.008) and invalid (IRBD: 0.74 ± 0.99 vs Controls: 1.73 ± 0.86; p = 0.009) conditions. The P300 amplitude was correlated with Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA) scores (r = 0.424, p = 0.024).CONCLUSION: Reduced P300 amplitude during the Posner task provides electrophysiological evidence for subclinical visuospatial attention deficits in cognitively normal IRBD patients. The results of this study imply that cortical dysfunction is already present in patients with IRBD in their early disease stage."

This research study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a holistic health group intervention, which is based on the holistic brain health approach as well as an Eastern approach to health care, on improving the cognitive ability of Chinese PwMCI.RESEARCH METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), 38 Chinese PwMCI were randomly assigned to either a 10-session holistic health intervention group or the control group. The holistic health treatment group attempted to promote the acceptance of their illness, enhance memory and coping skills, develop a positive lifestyle, maintain positive emotions, and facilitate emotional support among participants. The 10-session holistic health group intervention was structured, with each session conducted once per week and ~90 minutes in length. Control group patients and their family caregivers received standardized basic educational materials that provided basic information on cognitive decline for them to read at home. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test was used to assess the cognitive ability of PwMCI in the pre- and posttreatment periods by a research assistant who was blind to the group assignment of the participants.CONCLUSION: This present RCT provides evidence to support the feasibility and effectiveness of the holistic health group intervention in improving the cognitive and short-term memory abilities of PwMCI."
"29016605","Cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients: Implementation of cut-off values for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)-test for feasible screening.","OBJECTIVE: Reliable identification of cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients is of utmost importance, as it is associated with poor outcomes including dialysis withdrawal and death. High prevalence of cognitive impairment has been demonstrated in several studies using brief screening instruments or neuropsychological test batteries. However, the relevance of cognitive impairment as well as the accuracy of screening procedures have never been studied in this patient population.METHODS: 151 chronic hemodialysis patients (mean age 65.78 ± 14.88 years, 73,5% male) underwent cognitive testing under standardized conditions by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and, in a second step, the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR), an international standard to measure the severity of dementia. For calculating MoCA cut-off values on the basis of the CDR global score, receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis and c-statistic were applied.RESULTS: 49.0% of patients were categorized as 0.5 in the CDR global with memory being the predominantly affected domain (47.7% of patients scored = 0.5). Youden's Index led to a threshold of 23.5 points for the MoCA test for optimal differentiation between cognitively normal (CDR global &lt; 0.5) and impaired patients (CDR global = 0.5) based on a sensitivity of approximately 99% and a specificity of approximately 74%.CONCLUSION: Interference of cognitive impairment with patients' independence and daily life was shown using the CDR for the first time in hemodialysis patients. A MoCA score of 23.5 points turned out as optimal threshold to differentiate between patients with and without functional impairment in the CDR, thereby paving the way for implementation of the MoCA test as a quick and thus highly feasible screening instrument for periodic testing in clinical routine."
"28985341","Relationship Between Blood Pressure Variability and Cognitive Function in Elderly Patients With Good Blood Pressure Control.","BACKGROUND: Although higher blood pressure (BP) levels and BP variability have been associated with cognitive impairment, data are sparse regarding the relationship between BP variability and cognitive function in elderly patients with well BP control.METHODS: We analyzed 232 ambulatory patients with one or more cardiovascular risk factors. All patients underwent ambulatory BP monitoring and the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J).RESULTS: The mean age was 77.7 ± 8.3 years; 33.6% were male, and 85.3% were taking antihypertensive drugs. The average 24-hour BP level was 118.7 ± 10.0/68.3 ± 6.4 mm Hg. When we divided the weighted SD of systolic BP (SBP) as a measure of BP variability into quartiles, the top quartile group (=19.6 mm Hg) had a significantly lower total MoCA-J score (15.4 [95% confidence interval 14.2-16.7] vs. 17.9 [17.2-18.6], P = 0.001) and lower scores on several domains, visuoexecutive (2.2 [1.9-2.6] vs. 2.8 [2.6-2.9], P = 0.012), abstraction (1.0 [0.7-1.2] vs. 1.3 [1.1-1.4], P = 0.015), attention (2.8 [2.4-3.1] vs. 3.6 [3.4-3.8], P = 0.001), and naming (2.1 [1.9-2.3] vs. 2.5 [2.4-2.6], P = 0.001) than quartiles 1 through 3 combined, after adjustment for age and 24-hour SBP. These associations were not found in the quartiles of 24-hour SBP.CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients with well ambulatory BP control, higher BP variability but not average ambulatory BP level was associated with cognitive impairment."
"28969117","Effects of Sleep Deprivation on the Cognitive Performance of Nurses Working in Shift.","INTRODUCTION: Sleep deprivation and altered circadian rhythm affects the cognitive performance of an individual. Quality of sleep is compromised in those who are frequently involved in extended working hours and shift work which is found to be more common among nurses. Cognitive impairment leads to fatigability, decline in attention and efficiency in their workplace which puts their health and patients' health at risk.AIM: To find out the prevalence of sleep deprivation and its impact on cognition among shift working nurses.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sleep deprivation among 97 female and three male healthy nurses of age 20-50 years was assessed by Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS). Cognition was assessed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) questionnaire. Mobile applications were used to test their vigilance, reaction time, photographic memory and numerical cognition. The above said parameters were assessed during end of day shift and 3-4 days after start of night shift.RESULTS: Poor sleep quality was observed among 69% of shift working nurses according to ESS scores. The cognitive performance was analysed using Wilcoxon signed rank test. The MoCA score was found to be lesser among 66% of nurses during night (25.72) than day (26.81). During the night, 32% made more mathematical errors. It was also found that, 71%, 83% and 68% of the nurses scored lesser during night in the Stroop's colour test, vigilance test and memory tests respectively. Thus, impairment in cognitive performance was statistically significant (p&lt;0.001) among shift working nurses.CONCLUSION: Cognitive performance was found to be impaired among shift working nurses, due to poor sleep quality and decreased alertness during wake state. Thus, shift work poses significant cognitive risks in work performance of nurses."
"28964795","MoCA Domain Score Analysis and Relation to Mobility Outcomes in Dysvascular Lower Extremity Amputees.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between cognitive functioning, as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and functional outcomes upon discharge from prosthetic rehabilitation.DESIGN: Retrospective chart audit.SETTING: Rehabilitation hospital.PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive admissions (N=130; mean age, 66.21±11.19y) with lower extremity amputation of dysvascular etiology.INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognitive status was assessed using the MoCA. The L Test of Functional Mobility (L Test) and the 2-minute walk test were used to estimate functional mobility and walking endurance.RESULTS: In multivariable linear regression analysis, those who scored 2 on the visuospatial/executive functioning (out of 5) and language (out of 3) domains had statistically shorter distances walked on the 2-minute walk test than did those who scored the highest on these MoCA domains. These values were not clinically relevant. Time to complete the L Test for those who scored the lowest on the MoCA domains of visuospatial/executive functioning and delayed recall and 3 on the attention domain (out of 6) was significantly longer than that for those who scored the highest.CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with lower extremity amputation have an increased risk of cognitive impairment related to amputation etiology. Lower levels of functioning on MoCA domains of visuospatial/executive functioning, delayed recall, and attention were shown to negatively relate to the rehabilitation outcome of functional mobility, as measured by the L Test."
"28963056","Hippocampus-dependent spatial learning is associated with higher global cognition among healthy older adults.","Cognitive deficits in normal aging have been associated with atrophy of the hippocampus. As such, methods to detect early dysfunction of the hippocampus have become valuable, if not indispensable, to early intervention. The hippocampus is critical for spatial memory and is among the first structures to atrophy with aging. Despite the presence of navigation deficits in aging, few studies have looked at the association between wayfinding ability, navigation strategies, general cognitive function, and hippocampal volume. In the current study we investigated whether better general cognitive function is associated with the use of hippocampal-dependent spatial strategies, better spatial memory, and increased hippocampal volume. We also investigated, within older adults, the effects of aging on spatial memory. Healthy older adults (N = 107) were tested on a virtual wayfinding task and a dual-solution navigation task that can be solved using either a hippocampal-dependent spatial strategy or a caudate nucleus-dependent response strategy. Participants were also administered the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a test that measures general cognition and is sensitive to dementia. A structural MRI was administered to a sub-set of participants (n = 49) and hippocampal volume was calculated using a Multiple Automatically Generated Templates (MAGeT) Brain algorithm. We found that age was negatively associated with wayfinding ability and hippocampal volume. On the wayfinding task, participants with higher MoCA scores found more target locations and travelled shorter distances. We also found a significant association between higher MoCA scores and spatial strategy use. MoCA scores, spatial memory ability, and spatial strategy use all positively correlated with a larger hippocampal volume. These results confirm that with age there is a decrease in spatial memory, which is consistent with decreased volume in the hippocampus with aging. Furthermore, better general cognitive function is associated with better wayfinding ability and increased use of hippocampal-dependent spatial strategies."
"28956423","Influence of glucose metabolism on cognitive function of patients with acute small-artery occlusion.","The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of abnormal glucose metabolism on cognitive function of patients with acute small-arterial occlusion (SAO). The present study included 1,211 patients, with small-artery occlusion according to the Trial of Org 10172 in acute stroke treatment (TOAST) classification, admitted between March 2014 and December 2016 to The Second Hospital of Jiaxing. According to cognitive function, the patients were divided into a group of normal cognitive function, a mild cognitive impairment group (MCI group) and a dementia group. The patients were also divided into normal a blood sugar group, an impaired glucose regulation group (IGR group) and a diabetes mellitus (DM) group based on glucose metabolism. Cognitive functions of patients in the different glucose metabolism groups were compared based on Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). General data, medical history, neuropsychological assessment and haematological index of the patients in each group were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was used to study independent risk factors influencing cognitive impairment. When comparing the group of normal cognitive function with the MCI group, there were no statistical significant differences between the MMSEs scores of patients among the three groups, but the difference in MoCAs scores had statistical significance. Hypertension history, hyperhomocysteinemia (Hhcy) and sedentariness were independent risk factors for SAO patients with MCI. When comparing the group of normal cognitive function with the dementia group, there were statistically significant differences (P&lt;0.05) between the MMSE and MoCA scores of patients among the three groups. Abnormal glucose metabolism, old age, female, high blood pressure, Hhcy, family stroke history and sedentariness were independent risk factors for SAO patients with dementia. In conclusion, abnormal glucose metabolism impairing cognitive function is not an independent risk factor for SAO patients with MCI, but is an independent risk factor for SAO patients with dementia."

"28953682","Potential contribution of the neurodegenerative disorders risk loci to cognitive performance in an elderly male gout population.","Cognitive impairment has been described in elderly subjects with high normal concentrations of serum uric acid. However, it remains unclear if gout confers an increased poorer cognition than those in individuals with asymptomatic hyperuricemia. The present study aimed at evaluating cognitive function in patients suffering from gout in an elderly male population, and further investigating the genetic contributions to the risk of cognitive function.This study examined the cognitive function as assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in 205 male gout patients and 204 controls. The genetic basis of these cognitive measures was evaluated by genome-wide association study (GWAS) data in 102 male gout patients. Furthermore, 7 loci associated with cognition in GWAS were studied for correlation with gout in 1179 male gout patients and 1848 healthy male controls.Compared with controls, gout patients had significantly lower MoCA scores [22.78<U+200A>±<U+200A>3.01 vs 23.42<U+200A>±<U+200A>2.95, P<U+200A>=<U+200A>.023, adjusted by age, body mass index (BMI), education, and emotional disorder]. GWAS revealed 7 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associations with MoCA test at a level of conventional genome-wide significance (P<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>9.6<U+200A>×<U+200A>10). The most significant association was observed between rs12895072 and rs12434554 within the KTN1 gene (Padjusted<U+200A>=<U+200A>4.2<U+200A>×<U+200A>10, Padjusted<U+200A>=<U+200A>4.7<U+200A>×<U+200A>10) at 14q22.

We aim to evaluate associations between inflammatory markers and the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in T2DM. This study of 140 diabetic patients involved 71 with MCI and 69 controls. Clinical parameters, neuropsychological tests, high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), lipoprotein-associated Phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) mass and activity were measured. The results showed significantly higher plasma hsCRP, IL-6, Lp-PLA2 mass and activity in MCI group compared to controls. In T2DM with MCI, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score was positively correlated with education level and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), but inversely correlated with age, glycosylated hemoglobin, intima-media thickness (IMT), hsCRP, IL-6, and Lp-PLA2 mass and activity. Correlation analysis showed that both plasma Lp-PLA2 mass and activity were positively correlated with total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and IMT but negatively associated with MoCA score. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated higher hsCRP, Lp-PLA2 mass, Lp-PLA2 activity, and lower HDL-c to be independent risk factors increasing the possibility of MCI in T2DM. In conclusion, plasma Lp-PLA2 and hsCRP were found to be associated with the risk of MCI among T2DM patients."

However, the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and its relationship with physical function is not clear. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the prevalence of MCI and the relationship between MCI and physical function among older adults with pre-dialysis CKD.METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 120 patients, aged = 65 years (mean age, 77.3 years), with pre-dialysis CKD but without probable dementia (Mini Mental State Examination &lt; 24). MCI was evaluated using the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J). For analysis, patients were classified into two cognitive function groups: normal (MoCA-J =26) and MCI (MoCA-J &lt;26). Physical, clinical, and biochemical parameters were compared between the groups. Logistic and linear regression analyses were used to evaluate the specific association between cognitive and physical function.RESULTS: Seventy-five patients (62.5%) patients belonged to the MCI group. Significant differences between the two groups were identified for gait speed, balance, age, and haemoglobin concentration. After adjustment for covariates, only gait speed was significantly associated with MCI (odds ratio, 0.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.009-0,411).CONCLUSION: The prevalence of MCI among older adults with pre-dialysis CKD was as high as 62.5%. The association between MCI and reduced gait speed supports the possible interaction between physical and cognitive functions and the need for early screening."

MATERIAL AND METHODS In total of 385 elderly patients with chronic diseases were selected and assigned into CI and normal groups. The activities of daily living (ADL), global deterioration scale (GDS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA), patient-generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA), and mini nutritional assessment (MNA) were performed to analyze the differences between the 2 groups. Logistic regression analysis was conducted for risk factors of CI in elderly patients with chronic diseases. RESULTS There were differences in age, education level, type 2 diabetes mellitus, multifocal cerebral infarction, hearing, and eyesight between CI and normal groups. Patients in the CI group showed more CD4+ cells, more admission times, and higher GDS scores than the normal group. Also, MMSE and MoCA scores revealed differences in total score, directive force, attention and calculating ability, language, delayed memory, reading comprehension, writing, and visual-spatial ability between the 2 groups. The number of B and CD8+ cells, ADL, and MNA scores were protective factors, while cerebral infarction history, number of CD4+ cells, admission times, GDS score, and age were risk factors of CI in elderly patients with chronic diseases. CONCLUSIONS Our study provides evidence that cerebral infarction history, number of CD4+ cells, admission times, GDS score, and age are risk factors of CI in elderly patients with chronic diseases."

Measuring the stability of cognitive impairment is important for further understanding of this disorder. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has been demonstrated to be a brief and effective screening tool in detecting cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia. It has alternative versions designed for longitudinal settings. The current study retrospectively analyzed the total and subscores of two versions of the MoCA, administered to a group of inpatients with severe schizophrenia at admission and discharge, to measure their cognitive stability during hospitalization. The results revealed that the test-retest reliability coefficient of the MoCA had good reliability, suggesting the two alternative versions of the MoCA are reliable measurements for assessing cognitive impairment repeatedly in patients with schizophrenia. The paired-samples t-test showed that the overall cognitive impairment of patients measured by two forms of the MoCA remained stable during acute hospital stay and across symptom changes. Furthermore, the results showed that patients' cognitive stability was not related to their symptom/illness severity improvement, age, education, or length of stay."

All patients received a course of neurotrophic therapy consisting of 20 intravenous infusions of cerebrolysin (30 ml of cerebrolysin in 100 ml of isotonic sodium chloride solution). To assess the therapy efficacy, psychometric scales (CGI, MMSE, MoCA-test, <U+041C>DRS, FAB, Clock Drawing Test, BNT, Word Recall test, delayed reproduction of 10 words, naming digits in a direct and reverse order) were used at 0, 4, 10 and 26 weeks of the study. Antibodies to p75 neurotrophin receptor (NTR) were measured by ELISA in blood serum of 19 patients before cerebrolysin therapy and after 10 and 26 weeks of treatment.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The study showed that <U+0430>MCI patients had an increased level of antibodies against P75NTR that was significantly decreased after 5.5 month of cerebrolysin treatment. Therefore, it can be a potential biomarker of long-term therapeutic effect of cerebrolysin treatment in aMCI patients. The modified fragment 155-164 of P75 NTR determined in the serum of patients can be an effective indicator for monitoring and predicting the efficacy of long-term neurotrophic therapy."

"28877857","Reduced mind wandering in patients with Parkinson's disease.","BACKGROUND: Mind Wandering (MW) refers to the process of disengaging from the immediate external environment and participating in internally driven mentation. This process has been suggested to be supported by a distributed set of brain regions, collectively referred to as the Default Mode Network (DMN). Recently, reduced recruitment and connectivity of the DMN has been described in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients compared to healthy controls. We thus aimed to explore whether PD patients with normal cognitive test scores show differential MW capabilities compared to healthy controls.METHODS: Thirty PD patients and thirty age-matched controls, all with a Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) score of 26 or above, performed a novel yet validated thought-sampling paradigm used to assess the frequency and extent of MW irrespective of cognitive load in which participants were asked to observe a series of geometric shapes and describe their thoughts after watching them. Shapes were presented one at a time for varying durations across nine trials.RESULTS: PD patients showed significantly less MW compared to the control. ANCOVA revealed a significant interaction indicating that the difference in MW scores was driven by trials with short stimulus presentation times.CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide evidence for decreased MW in PD patients. We propose that this is due to difficulties in performing MW within short time frames."
"28871713","Cognitive functions and serum cortisol concentration in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women working non-manually.","OBJECTIVES: To asses a possible relationship between serum cortisol concentration and cognitive function in peri- and postmenopausal women engaging in non-manual work.METHODS: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to screen women for the study and the Computerized Neurocognitive-assessment Software (CNS) Vital Signs to diagnose cognitive functions.RESULTS: Cognitive functions and serum cortisol concentration did not differ between women in early and late perimenopause and postmenopause. The women in the study obtained lower reaction time compared to other cognitive functions studied. Cognitive functions correlated negatively with age and educational level, but not BMI. Serum cortisol concentration correlated negatively to NCI, motor speed, psychomotor speed and reaction time in postmenopausal women, but positively to complex memory in early perimenopausal women and to processing speed in early and late perimenopasal women.CONCLUSION: Higher serum cortisol concentration may negatively effect cognitive functions in women post menopause."
"28860729","Aging and extrapulmonary effects of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","INTRODUCTION: People with COPD have a decline in functional status, but little is known about the rate of decline and factors that contribute. Of particular concern is the decline in cognitive and functional performance. Decrease in cognitive and functional performance will finally lead to decreased health status, sedentary life style and premature frailty.AIM: The aim of this study is to compare functional performance and cognitive status in patients with COPD of different ages and to examine the changes in extrapulmonary effects.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 62 patients with COPD risk class D who were divided into two groups (&lt;70 years, N=30 and &gt;70 years, N=32). Patients first completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), which is a 30-point test that assesses different cognitive domains, while isometric knee extension (IKE) was measured using a digital handheld dynamometer, and functional exercise level was assessed using the 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) test.CONCLUSION: Elderly COPD patients have reduced exercise capacity and muscle strength, deteriorated cognitive function and increased inflammatory markers. Furthermore, inflammation markers were significantly correlated with muscle strength, walking distance and cognitive impairment."
"28849882","[Cognitive-cytokine effect of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in the therapy of elderly patients with osteoarthritis].","The purpose of the study was to evaluate the influence of long-term non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) therapy on the dynamics of the severity of cognitive deficits and its association with changes in the level of cytokines in elderly patients with osteoarthritis (OA). The authors performed a prospective observational study during 540±5,5 days, presented in two stages: phase I - the stage of active NSAID therapy; phase II - the stage of non-pharmacological correction of OA. The first stage included 128 patients with OA from 65 to 75 years (average age 70±4,6 years, 10,2% of males and 89,8% female). Patients from the main group were divided into four subgroups: patients of the 1st group (n=30) received the drug etoricoxib at a dose of 60 mg per day; patients of the 2nd group (n=32) - celecoxib at a dose of 200 mg daily, patients of the 3rd group (n=32) - nimesulide in dose of 100 mg per day; patients of the 4th group (n=34) - meloxicam at a dose of 7,5 mg per day. The comparison group consisted of 40 patients with similar clinical and demographic characteristics of OA, not taking NSAIDs in the previous 6 months or during the study. It was determined the pain and stiffness indexes by the WOMAC initially and evaluated the patient status at the MoCA scale and carried out laboratory diagnosis of contents in serum TGF-ß1, IL-1ß and IL-6 at all visits. Statistically significant decrease in the level of cytokines was detected during the period of 1st-3rd visits for all patients in the groups receiving NSAID, also there was an increase in cognitive function on a scale of MoCA with a high degree of correlation in relation to the performance of cytokines to the end of the study. The results of our research allow us to speak about possible influence on cognitive functions of NSAID therapy in elderly patients with OA in real clinical practice."
"28848488","Cognitive Improvement and Brain Changes after Real-Time Functional MRI Neurofeedback Training in Healthy Elderly and Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease.","BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline is characteristic for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and also for healthy ageing. As a proof-of-concept study, we examined whether this decline can be counteracted using real-time fMRI neurofeedback training. Visuospatial memory and the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) were targeted.METHODS: Sixteen healthy elderly subjects (mean age 63.5<U+2009>years, SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>6.663) and 10 patients with prodromal AD (mean age 66.2<U+2009>years, SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>8.930) completed the experiment. Four additional healthy subjects formed a sham-feedback condition to validate the paradigm. The protocol spanned five examination days (T1-T5). T1 contained a neuropsychological pre-test, the encoding of a real-world footpath, and an anatomical MRI scan of the brain. T2-T4 included the fMRI neurofeedback training paradigm, in which subjects learned to enhance activation of the left PHG while recalling the path encoded on T1. At T5, the neuropsychological post-test and another anatomical MRI brain scan were performed. The neuropsychological battery included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); the Visual and Verbal Memory Test (VVM); subtests of the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS); the Visual Patterns Test; and Trail Making Tests (TMT) A and B.RESULTS: Healthy elderly and patients with prodromal AD showed improved visuospatial memory performance after neurofeedback training. Healthy subjects also performed better in a working-memory task (WMS backward digit-span) and in the MoCA. Both groups were able to elicit parahippocampal activation during training, but no significant changes in brain activation were found over the course of the training. However, Granger-causality-analysis revealed changes in cerebral connectivity over the course of the training, involving the parahippocampus and identifying the precuneus as main driver of activation in both groups. Voxel-based morphometry showed increases in grey matter volumes in the precuneus and frontal cortex. Neither cognitive enhancements, nor parahippocampal activation were found in the control group undergoing sham-feedback.CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that cognitive decline, either related to prodromal AD or healthy ageing, could be counteracted using fMRI-based neurofeedback. Future research needs to determine the potential of this method as a treatment tool."
"28844367","Apathy in drug-naïve patients with Parkinson's disease.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the prevalence and clinical correlates of apathy in early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) from a cohort of Chinese patients.METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of 133 treatment-naive PD patients was conducted. Each subject was categorized as PD with or without apathy using the Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS).RESULTS: Of 133 patients, 30 PD patients (22.56%) reported apathy, of whom 23 (17.29%) did not have concomitant depression. The stepwise binary logistic regression model indicated that the lower Frontal assessment battery (FAB) score (OR = 0.623, 95% CI = 0.466-0.834, P = 0.001), the higher sleep/fatigue score from the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) (OR = 1.171, 95% CI = 1.071-1.279, P = 0.001), the higher Hamilton Depression Rating Scale including 24 items (HAMD-24) score (OR = 1.112, 95% CI = 1.005-1.230, P = 0.039) and the higher Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III score (OR = 1.119, 95% CI = 1.045-1.198, P = 0.001) were associated with apathy. No significant associations were found between apathy and other parameters such as age, sex distribution, disease duration, anxiety, Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) score, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) score and remaining domain scores for NMSS.CONCLUSIONS: Apathy is not rare (22.56%) in Chinese treatment-naïve PD patients. Apathy in PD is not only related to the severity of motor symptoms of the disease but also to some non-motor symptoms, such as executive dysfunction, depression and sleep disturbances."
"28823894","Changes of brain structure in Parkinson's disease patients with mild cognitive impairment analyzed via VBM technology.","OBJECTIVE: To analyze changes in cerebral grey matter volume and white matter density in non-dementia Parkinson's disease patients using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) technology; to investigate features of brain structure changes in Parkinson's disease patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), and reveal their intrinsic pathological changes.METHODS: Based on the diagnostic criteria of PD-MCI, 23 PD-MCI patients, 23 Parkinson's disease patients with normal cognition (PD-NC), and 21 age- and gender-matched healthy people were recruited for the study. Scans were performed on all subjects on a 3.0T MR scanner to obtain brain structural magnetic resonance images. Images were preprocessed using the VBM8 tool from SPM8 software package on the Matlab R2008a platform, and data were then analyzed using the SPM statistical software package to compare the differences of grey matter volume and white matter density between groups, and to evaluate the brain structural changes corresponding to the overall cognitive function.RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the PD-NC group suffered from grey matter atrophy, mainly found in the prefrontal lobe, limbic lobe and left temporal gyrus. The PD-MCI group suffered from grey matter atrophy found in the frontal lobe, limbic lobe, basal ganglia and cerebellum. Compared to the PD-NC group, the PD-MCI group suffered from grey matter atrophy found in the left-side middle temporal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus and frontal lobe. The grey matter regions correlated with MMSE score (mainly memory related) including the right cingulate gyrus and the limbic lobe. The grey matter regions correlated with MoCA score (mainly non-memory related) including the frontal lobe, basal ganglia, parahippocampal gyrus, occipital lobe and the cerebellum. Additionally, overall cognitive function in non-dementia PD was mainly located in the frontal and limbic system, and was dominated by subcortical atrophy.CONCLUSION: Structural changes in PD-MCI patients are associated with overall cognitive function, and the atrophic areas are mainly located in the frontal and limbic system, and are dominated by subcortical atrophy. Moreover, atrophy of limbic lobes is associated with impaired memory, whereas frontal lobe atrophy is associated with executive dysfunction. In addition, the subtle brain structure of the PD early cognitive impairment stage and PD-MCI stage can be detected via VBM technology, and thus, local brain atrophy may be a neuroimaging marker for the early diagnosis of PD-MCI."
"28810566","Correlation analysis between the LDL-C in serum and the onset of transient ischemic attack caused by CSVD.","The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in serum and the onset of transient ischemic attack caused by cerebral small vascular disease (CSVD). Between September 2012 and September 2015, 249 patients who were diagnosed as CSVD were randomly enrolled in this study. According to MRI results, patients were divided into the patient and control groups. In the patient group, the patients were further subdivided into the white matter lesion (WML) group (n=86) and lacunar infarction (LI) group (n=53). Head MRI and/or CT were conducted on all the patients. This included T1 and T2 phases, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR). Additionally, mini-mental status examination (MMSE) test and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) test were carried out on all the patients. As a result, the age, total cholesterol (TC) level and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in the patient group were higher than those in the control group (p&lt;0.05). The MMSE and MoCA scores in the patient group were significantly lower than those in the control group (p&lt;0.05). With all the risk factors being set as independent variables and small vessel disease (SVD) as the dependent variable, we performed the logistic regression analysis and correlation analysis for paired data, and found that the increase in LDL was correlated to the onset of SVD, OR=1,321. After adjustment of other risk factors, we enrolled the level of triglyceride (TG) into the multivariable analysis and obtained a statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.05). In conclusion, LDL is a major risk factor affecting the onset of transient ischemic attack (TIA) induced by CSVD. Patients with hyperlipidemia should receive head MRI or CT examination to eliminate the probability of the existence of CSVD. To reduce the occurrence of adverse events in clinical practice, we can perform early intervention in SVD by decreasing the level of LDL, improving the endothelial function of small vessels and applying the anti-inflammation and nerve-protection methods."
"28807493","Homocysteine and cognitive function in Parkinson's disease.","INTRODUCTION: Increased plasma homocysteine (HC) is a risk factor for dementia in the general population. Levodopa therapy causes increased plasma HC, but it remains unclear whether elevated plasma HC is associated with cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD).METHODS: The study population includes all participants in the Pacific Northwest Udall Center (PANUC) Clinical cohort at the time of the study, consisting of 294 individuals with PD who had a standardized neuropsychological assessment and plasma collection for HC measurement. We tested the hypothesis that elevated plasma HC is inversely related to cognitive function in patients with PD.RESULTS: As expected, plasma HC was positively associated with age, disease duration, disease severity, and levodopa usage, while cognitive function was associated with age, education, gender, and APOE genotype, so subsequent analyses controlled for these covariates. When plasma HC was dichotomized as normal (&lt;14 µmol/L) or elevated (=14 µmol/L), subjects with hyper-homocysteinemia had lower scores on Digit Symbol (p = 0.031), Hopkins Verbal Learning Task (HVLT) Delayed Recall (p = 0.004), and semantic verbal fluency (p = 0.049). When examined as a continuous variable, plasma HC was inversely associated with HVLT Delayed Recall (p = 0.009)) and semantic verbal fluency (p = 0.004), but was not significantly related to Digit symbol, Trail-making test, Judgment of Line Orientation, phonemic verbal fluency, MMSE, or MOCA. When analysis was restricted to non-demented subjects (n = 231), the findings were unchanged.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that plasma HC is significantly associated with some aspects of cognitive function in PD, and may represent a treatable risk factor for cognitive decline in PD."
"28803591","Genetic and Environmental Influences on Correlations Between Hearing and Cognitive Functions in Middle and Older Chinese Twins.","The genetic and environmental impacts on correlations between hearing and cognitive functions have not been well studied. Cognitive function was evaluated by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Hearing function was assessed by audiometric pure-tone hearing thresholds at different frequencies, including 0.5 kHz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 4 kHz, 8 kHz, and 12.5 kHz, with the lower hearing thresholds indicating better hearing function. Cognitive and hearing functions were measured on 379 complete twin pairs (240 monozygotic and 139 dizygotic pairs) with a median age of 50 years (range: 40-80 years). Bivariate twin models were fitted to quantify the genetic and environmental components of the correlations between hearing and cognitive functions. The analysis showed significantly high genetic correlation between 2 kHz of hearing and cognition (r G = -1.00, 95% CI [-1.00, -0.46]) and moderate genetic correlation between 4 kHz of hearing and cognition (r G = -0.62, 95% CI [-1.00, -0.14]). We found no significant genetic correlations between low as well as high frequencies of hearing and cognition. Low to moderate common and unique environmental correlations were shown between low frequencies of hearing and cognition (-0.13 to -0.39) and the common environmental correlation between 8 kHz, one of the high frequencies of hearing, and cognition (-0.22). The middle frequencies of hearing and cognitive functions may have a shared genetic basis. Low frequencies of hearing and cognition may share similar common and unique environmental factors. At 8 kHz, the high frequency of hearing and cognition may share similar common environment. This twin study detected a significant genetic and environmental basis in the phenotype correlation between cognition and hearing, which differed across frequencies."
"28783374","HIV and Cognitive Impairment in Clinical Practice: The Evaluation of a Stepwise Screening Protocol in Relation to Clinical Outcomes and Management.","Neurocognitive impairment (NCI) is an increasingly important comorbidity in an ageing HIV+ population. Despite the lack of available treatment modalities, screening for NCI is recommended. In the UMC Utrecht, yearly NCI screening is done using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) tool and the HIV Dementia Scale (HDS). The aim of this study was to evaluate this screening protocol in relation to clinical outcomes and management. A retrospective cohort study was performed in suppressed adult HIV+ patients. Apart from the MoCa and the HDS, the Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation-Participation (USER-P) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were performed. Patients scoring below average on cognitive screening tests or with subjective cognitive complaints were further evaluated using a standardized protocol, including optimizing cART and checking for somatic disorders. In patients with cognitive complaints and participation restrictions, cognitive rehabilitation was proposed. Two hundred eighty-six patients were screened. The vast majority were MSM with an average age of 49 years. One hundred forty-four out of 286 patients (50%) had an abnormal test score and/or had subjective cognitive complaints. Restrictions in participation were present in 23% of patients. Six patients on Efavirenz switched their regimes, as this drug is known for its potential central nervous system (CNS) side effects. A depressive component was present in 58 patients (40%). Five patients had a clinical relevant laboratory abnormality. Moreover, six patients were referred for cognitive rehabilitation, which resulted in a 100% success rate in set goals in the five evaluable patients. Although the protocol was not fully adhered to in all patients, it did result in detectable underlying causes of NCI in 59% of patients, and 21% was referred for further treatment. Moreover, cognitive rehabilitation appears to be a very successful intervention for patients with NCI who experience subjective complaints and participation restrictions."
"28755678","Cognitive impairment in Chinese IIDDs revealed by MoCA and P300.","To investigate the value of MoCA and auditory P300 as a cognitive assessment tool in chinese idiopathic inflammatory-demyelinating diseases (IIDDs), eighty three consecutive patients with IIDDs and thirteen sex- and age-matched healthy controls were recruited in the study. MMSE, MoCA and auditory P300 potential were administrated to each participant. The percentage of cognitive impairment in IIDDs patients was 24.1% by using MMSE, while the percentage was 81.9% by using MoCA. The majority of IIDDs participants had MMSE scores in the normal range. In contrast, few IIDDs participants scored in the normal range on the MoCA. Age, EDSS and depression correlated negatively with the total score of MoCA and MMSE. Years of education correlated positively with MoCA and MMSE. ADEM patients scored lower on all MoCA subtests. Prolonged latency P300 which negatively correlated with MoCA and reduced P300 amplitude which positively correlated with MoCA were detected in IIDDs patients. Thus MoCA is superior to the MMSE as a cognitive impairment scan tool and P300 is useful for detecting cogntive deficiency in chinese IIDDs."
"28738338","Cognitive Impairment Is Reflected by an Increased Difference between Real and Imagined Timed Up and Go Test Performance.","BACKGROUND: Recent research suggests using an imaginary version of the Timed Up and Go test (TUG) for a first assessment of cognitive impairment. By using the time difference between a real (TUGr) and an imagined (TUGi) TUG task, the objective of this study was to examine the effect of cognitive impairment on motor imagery ability.METHODS: Fifty-two participants (mean age 69.3 ± 4.0 years) with mild cognitive impairment or subjective cognitive impairment were included in this study. The time difference between the TUGr and the TUGi was used as the main outcome. The Trail Making Test part B (TMT B), the ratio between TMT A and TMT B, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) battery were the main independent variables.RESULTS: The difference between TUGr and TUGi performance time and the TMT B performance time increased with decreasing cognitive function (p &lt; 0.01). There was no relationship between TUGr and TUGi performance time and TMT B/A ratio. There were significant correlations between TUG time differences and the MoCA score (r = -0.489, p &lt; 0.01), the TMT B (r = 0.364, p &lt; 0.01), and the TMT B/A ratio (r = 0.377, p &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSION: The combination of TUGr and TUGi may have added value in assessing cognitive impairment, which is a possible pre-stage of dementia."
"28731508","A re-examination of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) cutoff scores.","OBJECTIVE: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; Nasreddine et al., 2005) is a cognitive screening tool that aims to differentiate healthy cognitive aging from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Several validation studies have been conducted on the MoCA, in a variety of clinical populations. Some studies have indicated that the originally suggested cutoff score of 26/30 leads to an inflated rate of false positives, particularly for those of older age and/or lower education. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the MoCA for differentiating healthy cognitive aging from possible MCI.METHODS: Of the 304 studies identified, nine met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. These studies were assessed across a range of cutoff scores to determine the respective sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative predictive accuracies, likelihood ratios for positive and negative results, classification accuracies, and Youden indices.RESULTS: Meta-analysis revealed a cutoff score of 23/30 yielded the best diagnostic accuracy across a range of parameters.CONCLUSIONS: A MoCA cutoff score of 23, rather than the initially recommended score of 26, lowers the false positive rate and shows overall better diagnostic accuracy. We recommend the use of this cutoff score going forward. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd."
"28715595","Lifestyle, Physical Activity and Cognitive Functions: the impact on the scores of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCa).","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a rapid screening tool, including subtests to assess several cognitive domains, developed to detect MCI from normal ageing cognitive changes. Several validation and normative studies have conducted around the world considering the influences of age and education on the MoCA score, but none takes into account the lifestyle and habits. However, lifestyles, and particularly physical activity (PA) have been positively associated with both physical and mental health in elderly. The aim of the present study is to investigate the influence of regularly practiced PA on the MoCA scores in a sample of Italian healthy elderly males. For this purpose sixty-five healthy adult males, aged 65-81 years were assigned to two groups, physically active group (PAG, N=33), and sedentary group (SG, N=32), according to recommended levels of physical activity by the World Health Organization. The Italian version of MoCA was administered to each participant. Raw data were analysed by a multiple regression model in which the independent variables were PA, age and education. Results showed a highly significant influence of PA on MoCA total score and on several cognitive domain sub-scores. Furthermore, multiple regression analysis indicated a larger impact on scores by PA than both age and education. In the light of these findings, it is advisable to pay attention to the life style of subject that undergoing a neuropsychological evaluation like the MoCa and in particular the level of PA practiced, as well as age and education."

Cognitive dysfunction was screened for and further assessed at a memory clinic. After excluding cognitively impaired participants, normative data was derived from 758 people, aged 65-85.RESULTS: MoCA cut-offs (-1 to -2 standard deviations) for cognitive impairment ranged from &lt;25 to &lt;21 for the lowest educated and &lt;26 to &lt;24 for the highest educated, depending on age group. Significant predictors for MoCA score were age, sex and level of education.CONCLUSION: We present detailed normative MoCA data and cut-offs according to the DSM-5 criteria for cognitive impairment based on a large population-based cohort of elderly individuals, screened and thoroughly investigated to rule out cognitive impairment. Level of education, sex, and age should be taken in account when evaluating MoCA score, which is facilitated by our online regression-based calculator that provide percentile and z-score for a subject's MoCA score."

Besides multiple other neurological symptoms, horizontal gaze palsy or oculomotor apraxia is common in GD3.OBJECTIVE: To characterize the saccades in patients with Norrbottnian GD3 with respect to their neurological and cognitive status using a computer-based eye-tracking technique.METHODS: Horizontal and vertical reflexive saccades as well as antisaccades of nine GD3 patients [4M/5F; 41.1<U+2009>±<U+2009>11.0<U+2009>years; modified severity scoring tool (mSST): 9.3<U+2009>±<U+2009>5.4; Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA): 24.0<U+2009>±<U+2009>4.2] and age-matched controls were analyzed using EyeBrain T2, a head-mounted binocular eye tracker. Systematic clinical assessment included the mSST, a valid tool for monitoring the neurological progression in GD3 and MoCA.CONCLUSION: The mean age of 41<U+2009>years of our GD3 cohort reflects the increased life expectancy of patients in the Norrbottnian area compared to other GD3 cohorts. Marked impairment of horizontal saccades was evident in all patients, whereas vertical saccades showed distinct impairment of downward velocity. Latency of reflexive saccades was associated with the severity of neurological symptoms. Increased latency and error rate in the antisaccade task were linked to cognitive impairment. The assessment of saccades provides markers for neurological and neuropsychological involvement in Norrbottnian GD3."

"28660996","Models of cognitive functions with respect to selected parameters of functional state of the thyroid gland in post-menopausal women.","INTRODUCTION: The objective of the study was the development of models of cognitive functions in a group of post-menopausal women, according to the concentration of the selected laboratory parameters evaluating the functional state of the thyroid gland.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted during 2012-2014, and covered women aged 50-65 years, minimum two years after the last menstruation, without chronic diseases, cancerous diseases, mental disorders, addiction to drugs or alcohol, and who did not use hormone replacement therapy. At the stage of qualification, a brief MoCA test was performed; 383 women were qualified for the study. Blood was collected for the determination of such parameters as: TSH, TT4, fT4, anti-TPO, anti-Tg, and AB-TSHR. Assessment of cognitive functions was performed using the diagnostic instrument Central Nervous System - Vital Signs (CNS-VS) (Polish version). The results were statistically analysed.RESULTS: The mean age of the women in the study was 56.4 ± 3.4; the mean TSH was 1.91 ± 1.35 mU/L, fT4 14.76 ± 2.34 pmol/L, and TT4 99.12 ± 16.98 nmol/L. Mean values were: 64.74 IU/L for anti-TPO, 100.69 IU/L for anti-Tg, and 1.40 IU/L for AB-TSHR. The examined women obtained the neurocognitive index (NCI) on the level of 84.4 scores, on average. The lowest results were obtained in tests assessing cognitive flexibility (mean 78.64 scores), processing speed (mean 79.25 scores), and executive functions (mean 79.75 scores). In the tests evaluating complex attention, the mean values were 82.24 scores, psychomotor speed - mean 83.42 scores, and reaction time - mean 86.87 scores. The women examined obtained the best results in tests assessing memory (mean 90.15 scores), including verbal (mean 91.22 scores), and visual (mean 93.37 scores). The NCI and cognitive function models were assessed from the aspect of thyroid gland examinations in post-menopausal women. Based on the analyses performed, the following conclusions were drawn: The developed models of cognitive functions indicate a considerable effect of TSH, fT4, AB-TSHR, and anti-TPO, as well as TT4 and anti-Tg, on the level of cognitive functions after menopause in the group examined. The conducted study suggests the need for examination of the functional state of the thyroid gland in post-menopausal women who show cognitive function disorders."
"28653212","Higher blood-brain barrier permeability is associated with higher white matter hyperintensities burden.","The pathogenesis of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) is incompletely understood but blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction may play a key role. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between BBB permeability and the severity of WMH burden. Consecutive participants without symptomatic stroke history presented for physical examination were recruited in this cross-sectional study and divided into three WMH burden groups according to total Fazekas scores. They received dynamic contrast-enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging to measure BBB permeability, and received Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). A total of 102 participants aged 49-90 years (mean age of 69.82 years) were enrolled (36 with low WMH burden, 35 with medium WMH burden, and 31 with high WMH burden). Multivariable linear regression analyses revealed that participants with higher WMH burden had significantly higher BBB leakage rate and area under the leakage curve in normal-appearing white matter, WMH, cortical gray matter, and deep gray matter (DGM) after adjustment for age, sex, and vascular risk factors. Scores on MMSE and MoCA decreased with increasing leakage rate in WMH and DGM after adjustment for age, sex, WMH burden, and education years. We found that higher BBB permeability is associated with higher WMH burden and cognitive decline. The compromised BBB integrity may be a critical contributor to the pathogenesis of WMH and part of a series of pathological processes that finally lead to cognitive impairment."
"28652967","Neural circuit of verbal humor comprehension in schizophrenia - an fMRI study.","Individuals with schizophrenia exhibit problems with understanding the figurative meaning of language. This study evaluates neural correlates of diminished humor comprehension observed in schizophrenia. The study included chronic schizophrenia (SCH) outpatients (n = 20), and sex, age and education level matched healthy controls (n = 20). The fMRI punchline based humor comprehension task consisted of 60 stories of which 20 had funny, 20 nonsensical and 20 neutral (not funny) punchlines. After the punchlines were presented, the participants were asked to indicate whether the story was comprehensible and how funny it was. Three contrasts were analyzed in both groups reflecting stages of humor processing: abstract vs neutral stories - incongruity detection; funny vs abstract - incongruity resolution and elaboration; and funny vs neutral - complete humor processing. Additionally, parametric modulation analysis was performed using both subjective ratings separately. Between-group comparisons revealed that the SCH subjects had attenuated activation in the right posterior superior temporal gyrus (BA 41) in case of irresolvable incongruity processing of nonsensical puns; in the left dorsomedial middle and superior frontal gyri (BA 8/9) in case of incongruity resolution and elaboration processing of funny puns; and in the interhemispheric dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (BA 24) in case of complete processing of funny puns. Additionally, during comprehensibility ratings the SCH group showed a suppressed activity in the left dorsomedial middle and superior frontal gyri (BA 8/9) and revealed weaker activation during funniness ratings in the left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (BA 24). Interestingly, these differences in the SCH group were accompanied behaviorally by a protraction of time in both types of rating responses and by indicating funny punchlines less comprehensible. Summarizing, our results indicate neural substrates of humor comprehension processing impairments in schizophrenia, which is accompanied by fronto-temporal hypoactivation."
"28640170","Effectiveness of Electroconvulsive Therapy and Associated Cognitive Change in Schizophrenia: A Naturalistic, Comparative Study of Treating Schizophrenia With Electroconvulsive Therapy.","OBJECTIVE: There is limited evidence regarding the relative treatment effectiveness and cognitive effects of different types of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in schizophrenia. In this study, we sought to determine the overall effectiveness and compare the symptomatic and cognitive outcomes of patients with schizophrenia who received different modalities of ECT treatment.METHODS: Patients received 1 of 4 of the following ECT modalities: bitemporal ECT with age-based dosing, right unilateral ECT with seizure threshold-based dosing, bitemporal ECT with seizure threshold-based dosing, and bifrontal ECT with seizure threshold-based dosing ECT. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were administered to 62 patients before and after the ECT course.RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in both the total and psychotic subscales of BPRS and MoCA scores across the patients after the course of ECT. The global improvements in both BPRS and MoCA scores after ECT were not influenced by the type of ECT administered. Age-based dosing, however, was associated with poorer memory outcomes posttreatment. The overall symptomatic response rate, defined as 40% or more reduction in the psychotic subscale of BPRS, was 64.5%. The response rates did not significantly differ between the 4 types of ECT.CONCLUSIONS: Our present findings suggest that an acute course of ECT is effective in schizophrenia and may have cognitive benefits for some patients."
"28639714","Plasma cytokine IL-6 levels and subjective cognitive decline: preliminary findings.","OBJECTIVE: Detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) prior to clinical inception will be paramount for introducing disease modifying treatments. We have begun collecting baseline characteristics of a community cohort for longitudinal assessment and testing of antecedent blood-based biomarkers. We describe the baseline visit from the first 131 subjects in relationship to a commonly described cytokine, interleukin 6 (IL-6).METHODS: Subjects from the community presented for a free memory screening with varying degrees of memory concern. We quantified the baseline plasma levels of the cytokine IL-6 and assessed cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA) and mood (Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS) in relationship to their memory concern.RESULTS: Baseline MoCA scores were inversely related to age, and this association was influenced by an AD risk factor, Apolipoprotein E (APOE4) carrier status. The degree of subjective cognitive decline correlated with GDS and was inversely related to MoCA scores. Interleukin 6 levels were related to age, body mass index, and years of education.CONCLUSIONS: It will be important to assess how these baseline IL-6 levels and forthcoming novel biomarkers relate to future cognitive decline.

"28638717","Validation of the Parkinson Fatigue Scale in Chinese Parkinson's disease patients.","OBJECTIVE: Fatigue is a common nonmotor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD); however, the Parkinson's disease fatigue scale (PFS), which is designed to measure fatigue in PD, has not been validated in China. The aim of this study was to determine the validity and reliability of the Chinese version of the PFS in PD patients.METHODS: A total of 115 PD patients were evaluated at baseline and after 7 days. Assessments included the PFS, the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and scales assessing motor, cognition, depression, and anxiety. Acceptability was assessed in terms of the rate of missing data and floor and ceiling effects. Cronbach's alpha was calculated to determine internal consistency. Test-retest reliability was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were used to calculate convergent and divergent validity between PFS scores and scales assessing clinical characteristics.RESULTS: No data were missing for the PFS. Compared with the original scoring method, the binary scoring method had relatively large floor effects (5.21% vs. 17.39%) and ceiling effects (0.90% vs. 4.31%). The internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the PFS were satisfactory (original scoring method: Cronbach's alpha = 0.97, ICC = 0.94; binary scoring method: Cronbach's alpha = 0.94, ICC = 0.94). The PFS score exhibited strong convergent validity with FSS score (correlation coefficient = 0.87). PFS score was weakly to moderately correlated with disease duration and with measures of disease stage, motor function, depression, and anxiety (range of correlation coefficients: 0.25-0.48). There was no significant correlation between PFS score and either onset age or MoCA score (range of correlation coefficients: -0.05 to 0.12).CONCLUSION: The Chinese version of the PFS is a valid measure for assessing fatigue in PD."

Patients in whom LCM was added to their AED regimen for clinical indications comprised the LCM group (n=18), while the control group (n=32) comprised patients on =2 AEDs with anticipated stable dosing for the duration of the study. Profile of Mood States (POMS) and QOLIE-89 were used to assess mood and QOL at enrollment and 12-16weeks later. Adherence to LCM was measured electronically with the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) and using a self-report measure. There were no significant between-group differences in age, AED load, side-effects (A-B Neurotoxicity Scale), MoCA mental status, or seizure-related factors. LCM adherence (measured by MEMS) was 70.7%. There was a significant decrease in negative mood states in the LCM group (estimated marginal mean at baseline=49.4, at follow-up=29.7; p=0.02), after controlling for seizure freedom. Based on previously reported benchmarks, clinically significant change on the POMS occurred in 7 (38%) LCM patients. The effect of LCM on the overall QOL was not significant (p=0.078). Correlation between POMS Total Mood Distress and Emotional-Wellbeing on the QOLIE-89 was significant (r=-0.783; p=0.01). These results suggest that LCM may have a favorable impact on mood."
"28600443","Prevalence, risk factors and consequences of cerebral small vessel diseases: data from three Asian countries.","BACKGROUND: Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) has been suggested to be more common in Asians compared with Caucasians. However, data from population-based studies in Asia are lacking. We report on the prevalence, risk factors and consequences of SVD from contemporary studies in three Asian countries using 3-Tesla MRI for the evaluation of SVD.METHODS: Clinical, cognitive and 3-Tesla brain MRI assessments were performed among participants of three studies from Singapore, Hong Kong and Korea. SVD markers include white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) using the modified Fazekas scale, lacunes and microbleeds. Cognition was assessed using the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Adjustments were made for age, sex and cardiovascular risk factors.RESULTS: A total of 1797 subjects were available for analysis (mean age: 70.1±6.3 years and 57% women). The prevalence of confluent WMH was 36.6%, lacunes, 24.6% and microbleeds, 26.9%. Presence of all three SVD markers showed a steeper increase with increasing age rising from 1.9% in the lowest to 46.2% in the highest 5-year age strata. The major risk factors for the increased severity of SVD markers were advancing age and hypertension. Moreover, increasing severity of SVD markers was independently associated with worse performance on MMSE and MoCA.CONCLUSION: Elderly Asians have a high burden of SVD which was associated with cognitive dysfunction. This suggests that SVD markers should be a potential target for treatment in clinical trials so as to delay progression of cerebrovascular disease and potentially cognitive decline."

We examined motor subtypes in an older age inpatient population, their relationship to clinical variables including delirium, and their association with 1-year mortality in a prospective study, using the Confusion Assessment Method, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Barthel Index, and Delirium Rating Scale-Revised 98 (DRS-R98). Motor subtypes were evaluated using 2 items of DRS-R98. Mortality rates were investigated 1 year later. Two hundred participated (mean age 81.1 [6.5]; 50% female). Thirty-four (17%) were identified with delirium. Motor subtypes were none: 119 (59.5%), hypoactive: 37 (18.5%), hyperactive: 29 (14.5%), and mixed: 15 (7.5%). Hypoactive and mixed subtypes were significantly more frequent in delirious patients. Regression analysis showed that hypoactive subtype was significantly associated with lower MoCA. No relationship between motor subtypes and mortality was found. Motor disturbances are not unique to delirium, with hypoactivity particularly associated with impaired cognition."

Our goal was to perform a detailed evaluation of cerebellar morphology. We performed the Unified HD rating scale (UHDRS) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA) in 26 HD patients and 26 healthy controls. We created a two-sample test to analyze cerebellar gray matter (GM) differences between groups and another to correlate GM alterations with UHDRS and MOCA, corrected for age, expanded cytosine-adenine-guanine repeats, and disease duration using the spatially unbiased atlas template (SUIT)-SPM-toolbox which preserves anatomical detailing. We found increased GM density in the anterior cerebellum compared to controls. Higher GM density in the postero-superior lobe correlated with mood symptoms. Worse motor function and better cognitive function correlated with GM changes in the posterior cerebellum (false discovery rate (FDR) correction p &lt; 0.05 and k &gt; 100 voxels).

Lactate plays multifunctional role in human brain energy metabolism and cognitive function. However, no direct evidence demonstrated the link between lactate and cognition in normal condition. In the present study, concentrations of lactate in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood were measured to investigate the association of lactate with cognitive ability, which was assessed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), in 99 male Chinese subjects. Correlation analyses revealed that serum lactate levels were negatively correlated with age, and CSF lactate levels were negatively correlated with MoCA scores after Box-Cox transformations. But no correlation was found between serum lactate levels and MoCA scores after Box-Cox transformations. In conclusion, the results indicate that CSF lactate levels were negatively correlated with MoCA scores in male Chinese subjects."

Twenty-one ALS patients and 21 age- and education-matched healthy subjects underwent the ET-based cognitive assessment, together with the standard cognitive screening tools [Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB); Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); and Digit Sequencing Task]. Psychological measures of anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Y) and depression (Beck Depression Inventory) were also collected, and an ET usability questionnaire was administered. For patients, clinical and respiratory examinations were also performed, together with behavioural assessment (Frontal Behavioural Inventory). The developed battery discriminated among patients and controls with regard to measures of verbal fluency, frontal abilities, and social cognition. Measures of diagnostic utility confirmed a higher diagnostic accuracy of such ET-based tests with respect to FAB; similar diagnostic accuracy emerged when comparing them to the other standard cognitive tools (MoCA, WM). Usability ratings about the ET tests were comparable among the two groups. The ET-based neuropsychological battery demonstrated good levels of diagnostic accuracy and usability in a clinical population of non-demented ALS patients, compared to matched healthy controls.

So far, the underlying pathogenesis remains unclear. Therefore, we examined the potential relationship between cognitive impairment and three different categories of risk factors with particular focus on arterial stiffness measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV). A total of 201 chronic hemodialysis patients underwent cognitive testing under standardized conditions using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Demographic data including cardiovascular risk factors, dialysis-associated factors as well as factors related to chronic kidney disease (CKD) were analyzed. To account for arterial stiffness, PWV was measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoried with an oscillometric device that records brachial blood pressure along with pulse waves. In our cohort, 60.2% of patients showed pathological MoCA test results indicating cognitive impairment. PWV was significantly associated with cognitive impairment apart from age, educational level, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. High prevalence of cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients was confirmed. For the first time, an association between cognitive impairment and arterial stiffness was detected in a larger cohort of hemodialysis patients. Concerning the underlying pathogenesis of cognitive impairment, current results revealed a potential involvement of arterial stiffness, which has to be further evaluated in future studies."

Nonetheless, in the Italian context, the most-diffused screening tools are still those originally devised to diagnose dementia. The present pilot study then aimed at investigating the potential and feasibility of a novel screening battery, the Cognitive Assessment for Stroke Patients (CASP), in a sample of Italian patients by comparing it to Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) tests. A total of 29 neurology patients took part in the study. Participants underwent a screening procedure including the administration of MMSE, MoCA, and CASP. Data analysis suggested that the scores of the Italian version of the CASP are relatively less affected by the presence of language difficulties-common sequelae of stroke and head traumas-with respect to MMSE and MoCA ones. Furthermore, CASP scores proved to be highly correlated with both MMSE and MoCA scores, showing good clinical potential. Finally, the outcomes of administered tests proved not to be influenced by etiology or gender, and CASP scores showed a diminishing trend related to patients' age and a positive association with patients' education."
"28487471","Using DTI to assess white matter microstructure in cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) in multicentre studies.","Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) have been proposed as clinical trial markers of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) due to their associations with outcomes such as cognition. However, studies investigating this have been predominantly single-centre. As clinical trials are likely to be multisite, further studies are required to determine whether associations with cognition of similar strengths can be detected in a multicentre setting. One hundred and nine patients (mean age =68 years) with symptomatic lacunar infarction and confluent white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on MRI was recruited across six sites as part of the PRESERVE DTI substudy. After handling missing data, 3T-MRI scanning was available from five sites on five scanner models (Siemens and Philips), alongside neuropsychological and quality of life (QoL) assessments. FA median and MD peak height were extracted from DTI histogram analysis. Multiple linear regressions were performed, including normalized brain volume, WMH lesion load, and n° lacunes as covariates, to investigate the association of FA and MD with cognition and QoL. DTI metrics from all white matter were significantly associated with global cognition (standardized ß =0.268), mental flexibility (ß =0.306), verbal fluency (ß =0.376), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (ß =0.273). The magnitudes of these associations were comparable with those previously reported from single-centre studies found in a systematic literature review. In this multicentre study, we confirmed associations between DTI parameters and cognition, which were similar in strength to those found in previous single-centre studies. The present study supports the use of DTI metrics as biomarkers of disease progression in multicentre studies."

We aimed to interrogate the validity of the MoCA in a cross-cultural context: in differentiating MCI from normal controls (NC); and identifying cut-offs and adjustments for age and education where possible. This review sourced a wide range of studies including case-control studies. In addition, we report findings for differentiating dementias from NC and MCI from dementias, however, these were not considered to be an appropriate use of the MoCA. The subject of the review assumes heterogeneity and therefore meta-analyses was not conducted. Quality ratings, forest plots of validated studies (sensitivity and specificity) with covariates (suggested cut-offs, age, education and country), and summary receiver operating characteristic curve are presented. The results showed a wide range in suggested cutoffs for MCI cross-culturally, with variability in levels of sensitivity and specificity ranging from low to high. Poor methodological rigor appears to have affected reported accuracy and validity of the MoCA. The review highlights the necessity for cross-cultural considerations when using the MoCA, and recognizing it as a screen and not a diagnostic tool. Appropriate cutoffs and point adjustments for education are suggested."

Migraineurs performed worse in the majority of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.007) compared to the healthy subjects, significantly in language (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.005), memory (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.006), executive functions (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.042), calculation (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.018) and orientation (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.012). Migraineurs had a lower score on the memory trial of the Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test (ROCF) (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.012). The P3 latency in Fz, Cz, Pz was prolonged in migraineurs compared with the normal control group (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). In addition, we analyzed significant correlations between MoCA score and the duration of migraine. We also observed that a decrease in the MoCA-executive functions and calculation score and in the ROCF-recall score were both correlated to the frequency of migraine. Migraineurs were more anxious than healthy subjects (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001), which is independent of cognitive testing. Differences were unrelated to age, gender and literacy.CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive performance decreases during migraine, and cognitive dysfunction can be related to the duration and frequency of a migraine attack."
"28469597","Cognitive Dysfunction Is Associated with Greater Imbalance and Falls in Essential Tremor.","BACKGROUND: Essential tremor (ET) is not exclusively a tremor disorder; it is also associated with cognitive and gait dysfunction. However, a gap in knowledge is that the relationship between cognitive and gait dysfunction has not been studied in detail in ET. We examined the relationship between cognition and balance and falls in ET and hypothesized that cognitive dysfunction in ET patients would be associated with greater problems with balance and more falls.METHODS: ET cases were recruited into the Clinical-pathological Study of Cognition in ET. A comprehensive cognitive assessment was performed. This included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to measure global cognition, multiple motor-free tests comprehensively assessing performance in each cognitive domain, and an assignment of Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores. We collected data on the number of reported falls in the past year, and balance confidence was assessed using the 6-item Activities of Balance Confidence Scale. These cross-sectional analyses utilized baseline data.CONCLUSION: These data indicate that a correlate of poorer cognition in ET is greater number of falls and lower balance confidence. Cognition should enter the dialog with ET patients as an issue of clinical significance."

In the present study the accuracy of three cognitive screening measures in this population was examined-the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R), and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).METHOD: A sample of 30 treatment-seeking substance users and 20 healthy individuals living in the community were administered the screening measures and a neuropsychological battery (NPB). Agreement of classification of cognitive impairment by the screening measures and NPB was examined.RESULTS: Results indicated that the ACE-R and MoCA had good discriminative ability in detection of cognitive impairment, with areas under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve of .85 (95% confidence interval, CI [.75. .94] and .84 (95% CI [.71, .93]) respectively. The MMSE had fair discriminative ability (.78, 95% CI [.65, .93]). The optimal cut-score for the ACE-R was 93 (impairment = score of 92 or less), at which it correctly classified 89% of individuals as cognitively impaired or intact, while the optimal cut-score for the MoCA was &lt;26 or &lt;27 depending on preference for either specificity or sensitivity. The optimal cut-score for the MMSE was &lt;29; however, this had low sensitivity despite good specificity.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the MoCA and ACE-R are both valid and time-efficient screening tools to detect cognitive impairment in the context of substance use."

"28394147","A lower ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids predicts better hippocampus-dependent spatial memory and cognitive status in older adults.","OBJECTIVE: Evidence from several cross-sectional studies indicates that an increase in omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) may negatively affect cognition in old age. The hippocampus is among the first neural structures affected by age and atrophy in this brain region is associated with cognitive decline. Therefore, we hypothesized that a lower omega-6:3 FA ratio would predict better hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, and a higher general cognitive status.METHOD: Fifty-two healthy older adults completed a Food Frequency Questionnaire, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment test (MoCA; a test of global cognition) and virtual navigation tasks that assess navigational strategies and spatial memory.RESULTS: In this cross-sectional study, a lower ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 FA intake strongly predicted more accurate hippocampus-dependent spatial memory and faster learning on our virtual navigation tasks, as well as higher cognitive status overall.CONCLUSIONS: These results may help elucidate why certain dietary patterns with a lower omega-6:3 FA ratio, like the Mediterranean diet, are associated with reduced risk of cognitive decline.

"28376127","The &quot;DOC&quot; screen: Feasible and valid screening for depression, Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and cognitive impairment in stroke prevention clinics.","BACKGROUND: Post-stroke Depression, Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and Cognitive impairment (&quot;DOC&quot;) are associated with greater mortality, worse recovery and poorer quality of life. Best practice recommendations endorse routine screening for each condition; yet, all are under-assessed, diagnosed and treated. We seek to determine the feasibility and validity of an integrated tool (&quot;DOC&quot; screen) to identify stroke clinic patients at high-risk of depression, OSA, and cognitive impairment.METHODS: All consecutive new referrals to a regional Stroke Prevention Clinic who were English-speaking and non-aphasic were eligible to be screened. Time for screen completion was logged. DOC screen results were compared to the neuropsychological battery and polysomnogram assessments using a modified receiver operator characteristic and area under the curve analysis. Data is reported to conform to STARD guidelines.FINDINGS: 1503 people were screened over 2 years. 89% of eligible patients completed the screen in 5 minutes or less (mean 4.2 minutes), less than half the time it takes to complete the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). 437 people consented to detailed testing. Of those, 421 completed the Structured Clinical Interview for Depression within 3 months of screening, 387 completed detailed neuropsychological testing within 3 months, and 88 had overnight polysomnograms. Screening scores combined with demographic variables (age, sex, education, body mass index), had excellent validity compared to gold standard diagnoses: DOC-Mood AUC 0.90; DOC-Apnea AUC 0.80; DOC-Cog AUC 0.81. DOC screen scores can reliably categorize patients in to low-, intermediate- or high-risk groups for further action and can do so with comparable accuracy to more time-consuming screens.CONCLUSIONS: Systematic screening of depression, obstructive sleep apnea, and cognitive impairment in 5 minutes or less is feasible and valid in a high volume stroke clinic using the DOC screen. The DOC screen may facilitate improved identification and treatment of these comorbidities to improve function in patients after stroke and in those with other neurological diseases that share these comorbid conditions (e.g. Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment, Parkinson's disease, Traumatic Brain Injury, multiple sclerosis)."

A total of 43 consecutive patients, who fulfilled the 2012 SLICC (Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics) classification criteria for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), were enrolled. Cognitive function was assessed using Montréal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) questionnaire. Demographic data and disease dynamics were collected in a proforma. Cognitive dysfunction was defined as score &lt; 26/30, adjusted for duration of formal education. SPSS version 16.0 for windows was used to analyse data and to calculate frequency of cognitive dysfunction.RESULTS: Out of 43 enrolled patients, 95.3% were females and 4.7% were males, with mean age of 28.72 ± 9.25 years and mean formal education duration of 10.98 ± 3.29 years. The mean disease duration was 24.21 ± 30.46 months. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) were present in all patients and anti-ds DNA in 93% patients. Cognitive dysfunction according to MoCA score was found in 65.1% (n=28) patients. For patients with disease duration more than two years, cognitive dysfunction was found in 60% patients [p&gt;0.05] and for duration of formal education less than 12 years in 74.1% patients [p&gt;0.05].CONCLUSION: In this study, two third of SLE patients had Cognitive dysfunction. Hence, there is an increasing need to recognise and initiate early therapy for this overlooked aspect of SLE with an aim to achieve better quality of life."

"28364958","Validation of the Spanish-language version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment test in adults older than 60 years.","INTRODUCTION: Few studies have validated the Spanish-language version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-S) test in Latin American populations.OBJETIVE: To evaluate the psychometric properties and discriminant validity of the MoCA-S in elderly patients in Santiago de Chile.METHODS: 172 individuals were grouped according to their clinical diagnosis based on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale as follows: amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI; n±24), non-amnestic MCI (naMCI; n±24), mild dementia (n±20), and cognitively normal (n±104). Participants were evaluated with both the MoCA-S and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) to determine the discriminant validity of the MoCA-S.RESULTS: Mean age and years of schooling were 73±6 and 11±4 years, respectively, with no significant intergroup differences. The MoCA-S displayed good internal consistency (Cronbach's a: 0.772), high inter-rater reliability (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.846; P&lt;.01), and high intra-rater reliability (test-retest reliability coefficient: 0.922; P&lt;.001). The MoCA-S was found to be an effective and valid test for detecting aMCI (AUC±0.903) and mild dementia (AUC±0.957); its effectiveness for detecting naMCI was lower (AUC±0.629). The optimal cut-off points for aMCI and mild dementia were&lt;21 and&lt;20, respectively, with sensitivity and specificity rates of 75% and 82% for aMCI and 90% and 86% for mild dementia. The level of education had a great impact on scores: as a result, 2 points were added for patients with less than 8 years of schooling and one point for patients with 8-12 years of schooling (MoCA-S1-2). The MoCA-S1-2 showed significantly greater discriminant validity than the MMSE for differentiating aMCI from dementia.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA-S1-2 is a short, easy-to-use, and useful test for diagnosing aMCI and mild dementia."
"28346532","Decline in changing Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores is associated with post-stroke cognitive decline determined by a formal neuropsychological evaluation.","OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine changes in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores within a one-year period after stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) in associating cognitive decline determined by a formal neuropsychological test battery.METHODS: Patients with ischemic stroke/TIA received MoCA and MMSE at baseline within 14 days after stroke/TIA, at 3-6 months and 1-year follow-ups. The scores of MoCA and MMSE were considered to have declined if there were a reduction of =2 points in the respective scores measured across two time points. The decline in neuropsychological diagnosis transitional status was defined by a category transition from no cognitive impairment or any cognitive impairment to a more severe cognitive impairment or dementia.RESULTS: 275 patients with a mean age of 59.8 ± 11.6 years, and education of 7.7 ± 4.3 years completed all the assessments at baseline, 3-6 months and 1-year follow-ups. A decline in MoCA scores from 3-6 months to 1 year was associated with higher risk of decline in diagnosis transitional status (odd ratio = 3.21, p = 0.004) in the same time period whereas there was no association with a decline in MMSE scores.CONCLUSIONS: The decline in MoCA scores from 3-6 months to 1 year after stroke/TIA has three times higher risk for decline in the diagnosis transitional status. The decline of MoCA scores (reduction = 2points) is associated with the decline in neuropsychological diagnosis transitional status."

We retrospectively studied whether morning versus afternoon assessment might affect the classification of patients aged 70 or older as severe (SCI), mild (MCI), and no (NCI) cognitive impairment by the MoCA.METHODS: Morning (12 p.m. or earlier) versus afternoon (later than 12 p.m.) proportions of SCI (MoCA score &lt;20), MCI (MoCA score 25-20) and NCI (MoCA score =26) were compared in a cohort of patients aged =70, attending a rapid-access TIA/stroke clinic.RESULTS: Of 278 patients, 113 (40.6%) were tested in the morning and 165 (59.4%) in the afternoon. The proportion with SCI was greater in the afternoon than in the morning (10.9 vs. 1.8%, respectively, p = 0.004), with no difference in age, education, diagnosis, disability, or vascular risk factors.CONCLUSIONS: Time-of-day appears to affect cognitive performance of older patients after they undergo TIA and minor stroke. If our cross-sectional findings are confirmed in cross-over studies with repeated testing, timing of assessments should be considered in clinical practice and in research studies."

Although the association between cardiovascular diseases and cognitive impairments (CIs) is well known, the prevalence particularly of mild CI in CR and the characteristics of affected patients have been insufficiently investigated so far.METHODS: In this prospective observational study, 496 patients (54.5 ± 6.2 years, 79.8% men) with coronary artery disease following an acute coronary event (ACE) were analyzed. Patients were enrolled within 14 days of discharge from the hospital in a 3-week inpatient CR program. Patients were tested for CI using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) upon admission to and discharge from CR. Additionally, sociodemographic, clinical, and physiological variables were documented. The data were analyzed descriptively and in a multivariate stepwise backward elimination regression model with respect to CI.CONCLUSION: The prevalence of CI in CR was considerably high, affecting more than one-third of cardiac patients. Besides age and education level, CI was associated with heavy workloads and a longer sick leave before ACE."
"28239668","Evaluation of cognitive impairment in elderly population with hypertension from a low-resource setting: Agreement and bias between screening tools.","INTRODUCTION: The evaluation of cognitive impairment in adulthood merits attention in societies in transition and especially in people with chronic diseases. Screening tools available for clinical practice and epidemiological studies have been designed in high-income but not in resource-constrained settings. The aim of this study was to assess the agreement and bias of three common tools used for screening of cognitive impairment in people with hypertension: the modified Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Leganés Cognitive Test (LCT).METHODS: A cross-sectional study enrolling participants with hypertension from a semi-urban area in Peru was performed. The three screening tools for cognitive impairment were applied on three consecutive days. The prevalence of cognitive impairment was calculated for each test. Pearson's correlation coefficients, Bland-Altman plots, and Kappa statistics were used to assess agreement and bias between screening tools.RESULTS: We evaluated 139 participants, mean age 76.5 years (SD ± 6.9), 56.1% females. Cognitive impairment was found in 28.1% of individuals using LCT, 63.3% using MMSE, and 100% using MoCA. Correlation coefficients ranged from 0.501 between LCT and MoCA, to 0.698 between MMSE and MoCA. Bland-Altman plots confirmed bias between screening tests. The agreement between MMSE and LCT was 60.4%, between MMSE and MoCA was 63.3%, and between MoCA and LCT was 28.1%.CONCLUSIONS: Three of the most commonly used screening tests to evaluate cognitive impairment showed major discrepancies in a resource-constrained setting, signaling towards a sorely need to develop and validate appropriate tools."
"28230198","Longitudinal association of hypertension and diabetes mellitus with cognitive functioning in a general 70-year-old population: the SONIC study.","Both hypertension and diabetes in middle-aged individuals have been suggested to be predictive indicators of cognitive decline. However, the association of hypertension, diabetes and their combination with cognitive functioning is still controversial in older people. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between cognitive decline and hypertension, diabetes, and their combination in 70-year-old people based on a 3-year longitudinal analysis. Four hundred and fifty-four people aged 70 (±1) years who participated in the Japanese longitudinal cohort study of Septuagenarians, Octogenarians and Nonagenarians Investigation with Centenarians (SONIC) were recruited randomly from a general population and were monitored for 3 years. The data, including most of the demographics, cognitive functioning measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Japanese version (MoCA-J), blood pressure, blood chemistry and other medical histories, were collected at baseline and during the follow-up. The prevalence of hypertension noted in the follow-up survey was significantly higher than than noted at baseline. The mean MoCA-J score at follow-up was not significantly different from the score obtained at baseline. However, the participants with diabetes, especially combined with hypertension at baseline, had significantly lower MoCA-J scores than those without lifestyle-related diseases. The combination of hypertension and diabetes was still a significant risk factor for cognitive decline, considering the MoCA-J scores obtained during the follow-up after adjustments at baseline, relative to sex, body mass index, dyslipidemia, smoking, excessive alcohol intake, antihypertensive treatment and education level (ß=-0.14; P&lt;0.01). Our findings indicate that diabetes and the combination of hypertension and diabetes are clear risk factors for future cognitive decline in elderly individuals who are 70 years of age."

The baseline survey was conducted in detoxification and rehabilitation centers in Guangdong province, China, from September to December in 2013. A total of 528 participants were included in our analysis. Cognitive impairment was measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Logistic regression was performed to explore the risk factors associated with cognitive impairment.RESULTS: Approximately 69.89% of the study participants exhibited cognitive impairment according to MoCA scores. Multiple logistic regression analyses indicated that older age (=30 years old), a longer duration of MA use (&gt;24 months), and a higher frequency of MA use (everyday) were associated with cognitive impairment, with adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of 1.58 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-2.34), 1.53 (95%CI: 1.01-2.31), and 1.55 (95%CI: 1.05-2.30), respectively. Methamphetamine users that had a higher level of education had a lower risk of cognitive impairment(OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>.59; 95%CI: .38-.93).CONCLUSIONS AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: Cognitive impairment occurred frequently among chronic MA users. The causal relationship between cognitive impairment and MA use needs to be ascertained in longitudinal studies in future work. Our study provides evidence for the development of intervention strategies for the prevention of MA use and associated cognitive impairment. (Am J Addict 2017;26:145-151)."

The main aim of this study was to examine the correlation and predictability of receptive vocabulary and cognitive functioning of elderly people with anamnestic variables: chronological age, sex, level of formal education, marital status, years of work and retirement and years spent in an institution for the elderly.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The sample of participants consisted of 120 elderly people, average age was 78 years, placed in institutional care for elderly people in four cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was three groups of variables: anamnestic, receptive vocabulary assessment, and cognitive assessments. A Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA) was used for the assessment of cognitive abilities. In order to estimate the receptive vocabulary Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-III-HR) was used.RESULTS: Results of multiple regression analysis show that part of the variance of receptive language which is explained by the model (anamnestic variables) was 44.0% and of cognitive functioning was 33.7%. The biggest single contribution to explaining the development of receptive vocabulary was given by predictor variable of college education (ß = 0.417) then variable university education (ß = 0.293), while the smallest single contribution was given by variable secondary education (ß = 0.167). The biggest single contribution to explaining the results of tests of cognitive function was given by predictor variable College education (ß = 0.328) and variable unskilled (ß = -0.229), which has a negative effect on the increase in recent cognitive functioning.CONCLUSION: Anamnestic variables were valid predictors of receptive vocabulary and cognitive functioning of elderly people. The highest individual contribution was given by variables describing the level of formal education of elderly."

CI was defined as an MMSE/MoCA score &lt;26.SECONDARY OUTCOMES: MMSE/MoCA overall and subdomain scores, Fazekas and medial temporal lobe atrophy scores.RESULTS: We included 200 patients, mean age 79.5 (standard deviation 6.6) years (Syncope Group: n = 101; Fall Group: n = 99). Prevalence of CI was 16.8% (MMSE) versus 60.4% (MoCA) in the Syncope Group (P &lt; .001) and 16.8% (MMSE) versus 56.6% (MoCA) in the Fall Group (P &lt; .001). Prevalence of CI did not differ between the Syncope Group and Fall Group with either method. Executive dysfunction was present in both groups.CONCLUSION: CI is as common in elderly patients with syncope as it is in patients with unexplained falls, with an overall prevalence of 58%. The MMSE fails as a screening instrument for CI in these patients, because it does not assess executive function. Therefore, we recommend the MoCA for cognitive screening in older patients with syncope and unexplained falls."

In this paper, we investigate if machine-learning classifiers offer the discriminative power for the diagnosis of AD based on postural control kinematics. We compared Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Multiple Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBNs), and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) on 72 participants (36 AD patients and 36 healthy subjects) exposed to seven increasingly difficult postural tasks. The decisional space was composed of 18 kinematic variables (adjusted for age, education, height, and weight), with or without neuropsychological evaluation (Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) score), top ranked in an error incremental analysis. Classification results were based on threefold cross validation of 50 independent and randomized runs sets: training (50%), test (40%), and validation (10%). Having a decisional space relying solely on postural kinematics, accuracy of AD diagnosis ranged from 71.7 to 86.1%. Adding the MoCA variable, the accuracy ranged between 91 and 96.6%. MLP classifier achieved top performance in both decisional spaces. Having comprehended the interdynamic interaction between postural stability and cognitive performance, our results endorse machine-learning models as a useful tool for computer-aided diagnosis of AD based on postural control kinematics."

According to the histological type of tumors, the patients were classified into three groups: Group A included 22 patients with meningioma, Group B composed of 16 patients diagnosed with glioblastoma, and Group C including 14 patients diagnosed with diffuse astrocytoma. Neurological examination, neuroimaging assessment [computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for skulls] to diagnose primitive brain tumors, then the confirmation of clinical and histopathological diagnoses were performed for these patients. For cognitive assessment performed before surgery, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG) scales were used. The results were statistically analyzed using the Student's t-test; p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTS: In terms of age, we did not observe statistically significant differences between the three groups of patients. The group of patients with diffuse astrocytoma presented a higher educational level compared to patients with glioblastoma or meningioma. MoCA score obtained in glioblastoma group was 21.7 points, while in the group of patients with diffuse astrocytoma was 23.5 points, and in the group of patients with meningioma 24.2 points. The cognitive assessment using CAMCOG scale led to the following results: group of patients diagnosed with glioblastoma showed an average score of 83.5 points, the diffuse astrocytoma group had an average score of 88.9 points and the group with meningioma an average score of 90.1 points.CONCLUSIONS: Patients diagnosed with glioblastoma showed a statistically significant cognitive decline in comparison to patients diagnosed with diffuse astrocytoma (p&lt;0.05). We did not notice statistically significant differences in the cognitive decline of patients with meningioma compared to those diagnosed with diffuse astrocytoma (p&gt;0.05)."
"29927411","[A rare variant in the sortilin-related receptor 1 gene is associated with declined cognitive functions in the elderly].","AIM: To estimate the association of rs11218343 in the sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1) gene with cognitive performance in the elderly and with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the Russian population.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A sample included 586 elderly people (mean age 70.9±5.7 years) without AD diagnosis and 100 patients with late-onset AD (mean age 72.1±7.8 years) from the Tomsk population. SORL1 rs11218343 was genotyped using PCR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Cognitive performance in the sample of elderly without AD was assessed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test.RESULTS: Allele frequencies of the SORL1 polymorphism were not significantly different between the elderly without AD and AD patients. However mean MoCA score in the carriers of the rare allele (19.00±6.61) was significantly lower than in homozygotes for the common variant (22.25±3.89) (F=4.97; p=0.026).CONCLUSION: The rare variant in SORL1 gene previously associated with AD in genome-wide association studies and meta-analyses was associated with lower total <U+041C><U+043E><U+0421><U+0410> scores in the random sample of elderly people that suggests declined cognitive functions in the carriers of this variant in elderly."
"29911280","Claustral structural connectivity and cognitive impairment in drug naïve Parkinson's disease.","The claustrum is a thin grey matter structure which is involved in a wide brain network. Previous studies suggested a link between claustrum and Parkinson's Disease (PD), showing how a-synuclein pathology may affect claustral neurons as well as how a-synuclein immunoreactivity may correlate with the onset of cognitive dysfunctions. Our aim is to investigate, via diffusion MRI, claustral structural network changes in drug naïve PD patients, with the goal to understand whether such changes may contribute to cognitive decline in PD. 15 drug naïve PD patients and 15 age-matched controls were enrolled; MR protocol was performed on a 3T scanner. Whole brain probabilistic tractography was obtained using Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD) diffusion model. Connectivity matrices were estimated based on a robust anatomical parcellation of structural T1w images. In PD group, impaired subnetworks were correlated with psychological examinations. We found decreased claustral connectivity in PD patients compared to controls, especially with areas mainly involved in visuomotor and attentional systems. Moreover, we found a positive correlation between MoCA and density of pathways connecting ipsilaterally claustrum to left (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.578, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.021) and right (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.640, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.020) Pars Orbitalis. Our results support the hypothesis of claustral involvement in cognitive decline in drug naïve PD patients."

We included all studies referencing the MoCA as an instrument to evaluate cognitive deterioration conducted in Latin America and that included normative and psychometric data, as well as its clinical validation.RESULTS: Of the 80 studies identified, 19 met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies mentioned the use of the Spanish version of the MoCA and reported a statistically significant effect of gender, age and, most of all, education on the performance of this test. Only five studies presented with a detailed analysis of the psychometric characteristics of the test, and in most articles cut-off scores for the diagnosis of cognitive impairment were the same as the original study.CONCLUSIONS: The small number of articles identified may reflect a late start of the use of MoCA in Latin America. A tendency towards the use of this test without making a cross-cultural adaptation and the use of international norms was observed in this region. The present systematic review demonstrates the need for future research tackling the development of a linguistically adapted version of the MoCA to Latin America and the study of its psychometric properties, with the aim of improving cognitive assessment.TITLE: Uso del test de evaluacion cognitiva de Montreal (MoCA) en America Latina: revision sistematica.Objetivo.

Sleep plays a role in memory consolidation. Sleep disturbances, commonly found in patients with diabetes, were shown to be related to cognitive dysfunction. This study explored the role of sleep in cognitive function of patients with abnormal glucose tolerance.METHODS: A total of 162 patients (81 type 2 diabetes and 81 prediabetes) participated. Sleep duration and sleep efficiency (an indicator of sleep quality) were obtained using 7-day actigraphy recordings. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was screened using an overnight in-home monitor. Cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Three sub-scores of MoCA, visuoexecutive function, attention and delayed recall, were also analyzed.RESULTS: Mean age was 54.8 (10.2) years. OSA was diagnosed in 123 participants (76.9%). Mean sleep duration was 6.0 (1.0) h and sleep efficiency was 82.7 (8.1) %. Sleep duration and OSA severity were not related to MoCA scores. Higher sleep efficiency was associated with higher MoCA scores (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.003), and having diabetes (vs. prediabetes) was associated with lower MoCA scores (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001). After adjusting covariates, both having diabetes (vs. prediabetes) (B<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>1.137, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.002) and sleep efficiency (B<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.085, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) were independently associated with MoCA scores. In addition, diabetes (B<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.608, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) and sleep efficiency (B<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.038, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) were associated with visuoexecutive function. Sleep parameters were not related to delayed recall or attention scores.CONCLUSION: Lower sleep efficiency is independently associated with lower cognitive function in patients with abnormal glucose tolerance. Whether sleep optimization may improve cognitive function in these patients should be explored."

Neuropsychological assessment included Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Trail Making test (part A and part B), Stroop Color and Word Test, verbal fluency test (phonemic verbal fluency and semantic verbal fluency), 10-item word list learning task. All subjects underwent brain MRI. MRI protocol included ASL. Vascular age was calculated by two techniques - using Framingham Heart Study risk tables and SCORE project scales.RESULTS: Patients with EAH had lower performance on phonemic verbal fluency test and lower mean MoCA score (29.2±1.4 vs. 28.1±1.7 points) compared to controls (13.4±3.2, <U+0440>=0.002; 29.2±1.4, p=0.001, respectively). White matter hyperintensities (WMH) were present in 7.5 % controls and in 51.5 % EAH patients (<U+0440>=0.0002).

"29869975","Postural sway in patients with early Parkinson's disease performing cognitive tasks while standing.","OBJECTIVES: We investigated postural sway in patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD) to test the hypothesis that the postural control system was affected already at an early stage of PD. Moreover, we identified cases of dysfunction of stereopsis in PD patients.METHODS: We examined 23 patients with early PD and 23 healthy, sex- and age-matched control subjects. Postural sway was measured with an accelerometer at the center of mass at the lower spine. Subjects were asked to stand quietly for 30 s under two usual conditions (eyes open and eyes closed) and two dual tasks conditions (eyes open with dual task, eyes closed with dual task). Stereopsis was assessed using the Titmus fly test.RESULTS: In the usual conditions, no differences were found between the control group and PD group. With increasing task difficulty, PD patients showed an increase of RMS values of sway acceleration, compared to control subjects. These differences reached significance during cognitive task performance. PD patients showed larger JERK values with increasing difficulty of the sway task which also reached significance during cognitive task performance. Relative to controls, PD patients showed decreased stereopsis function. But, there were no statistically significant correlations between log seconds of arc of the Titmus test and JERK, even during cognitive task performance.CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that patients with early PD have subtle signs of postural instability when their attention is diverted or reduced. In addition, deficits of stereopsis may be common in early PD patients.

"29846283","Menopausal hormone therapy and mild cognitive impairment: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to explore the therapeutic potential of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) in women with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).METHODS: Thirty-seven postmenopausal women (age range: 57-82 y) with multiple-domain, amnestic subtype MCI were randomly assigned to either placebo (n<U+200A>=<U+200A>18) or MHT (n<U+200A>=<U+200A>19) for 24 months (percutaneous estradiol [E2] gel [0.1%, 2<U+200A>mg/d] and oral micronized progesterone [MP4] [100<U+200A>mg/d]). All participants received donepezil, and apolipoprotein E genotype was determined. The primary endpoint was general cognitive function: Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale, cognitive subscale, the Korean version of Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE), and the Korean version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA_K) were performed in-person every 6 months.RESULTS: Twenty-one participants (placebo 13, MHT 8) completed the trial (56.8%). Progression rates to dementia were 52.9% (9/17) in the placebo group and 44.4% (8/18) in the MHT group. Within-group analysis showed that all three tests significantly worsened during the trial in the placebo, but not the MHT groups. Analysis adjusted for e4 allele demonstrated that MHT significantly reduced deterioration of MoCA_K score, a sensitive tool for assessing global cognition in MCI (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.0261). Compared with the control group, both MoCA_K (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.043; mean difference, 3.85; 95% CI, -0.46 to 8.16) and K-MMSE (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.0319; mean difference, 3.26; 95% CI, 0.04-6.48) scores were significantly better at 24 months in the MHT group.CONCLUSIONS: Long-term MHT using percutaneous E2 gel and oral MP4 might attenuate cognitive decline in postmenopausal women with MCI."
"29843126","The Relationship between Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scores in Older Adults.","BACKGROUND: Relatively little is known regarding the association between objective measures of physical function such as cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and cognitive function tests in healthy older adults.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between CRF and cognitive function in adults aged 55 and older.METHODS: Between 2008 and 2017, 4,931 men and women underwent a comprehensive preventive physical exam at the Cooper Clinic in Dallas, Texas. CRF was determined by duration of a maximal treadmill exercise test. Cognitive function was evaluated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). In a multivariate model, adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for MoCA scores &lt; 26 (i.e., cognitive impairment) were determined by using CRF as both a continuous and a categorical variable.RESULTS: The mean age of the sample was 61.0 ± 6.0 years; mean maximal MET values were 10.0 ± 2.2. Mean MoCA scores were 26.9 ± 2.2; 23.4% of the sample had MoCA scores indicative of cognitive impairment. The odds ratio for cognitive impairment was 0.93 (0.88-0.97) per 1-MET increment in CRF. When examined as a categorical variable, and using the lowest CRF quintile as the referent, there was a significantly reduced likelihood for cognitive impairment across the remaining ordered CRF categories (p trend = 0.004).CONCLUSION: The association between CRF and MoCA score in older adults suggests that meeting or exceeding public health guidelines for physical activity is likely to increase CRF in low fit individuals, maintain CRF in those with a moderate to high level of CRF, and thereby help to maintain cognitive function in healthy older adults."
"29804147","Correlation among olfactory function, motors' symptoms, cognitive impairment, apathy, and fatigue in patients with Parkinson's disease.","Although Parkinson's disease (PD) is usually considered as a movement disorder, it is strongly associated with non-motor symptoms (NMS), including smell and taste dysfunctions, cognitive impairment, apathy, fatigue, and autonomic dysregulation. Olfactory deficit is considered the most common NMS in PD preceding the motor symptoms for years. The aim of this study was to investigate olfactory function, cognitive impairment, apathy, and fatigue in patients with PD in comparison with healthy controls, and subsequently to analyse the correlations between these NMS and motor symptoms severity in subjects with PD. One hundred and forty-seven participants were enrolled (96 PD patients, mean age in years 67.5, SD 7.2; 51 healthy controls; mean age 65.1, SD 11.8). Olfactory function was evaluated using the Sniffin' Sticks test (odor detection threshold, discrimination and identification). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to assess cognitive impairment. Apathy was examined by the self-report version of Starkstein Apathy Scale and fatigue was evaluated with the Parkinson's Disease Fatigue Scale. PD patients showed severe impairment in odor detection threshold, discrimination, and identification compared to healthy controls. Moreover, in PD patients, apathy and fatigue scores were significantly increased, while MoCA scores were decreased in comparison with controls. Multivariate linear regression analyses showed that both apathy and Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) were associated with odor identification, discrimination and Threshold-Discrimination-Identification (TDI) score. In conclusion, our results reported changes in apathy and motor disability as significant predictors in alterations of odor identification, discrimination and TDI score. Furthermore, these data suggest that olfactory dysfunction might progress in tight relation with motor impairment UPDRS but also with non-motor symptoms such as apathy."
"29791452","Validity and reliability of two alternate versions of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (Hong Kong version) for screening of Mild Neurocognitive Disorder.","OBJECTIVE: Repeated testing using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) increases risks for practice effects which may bias measurements of cognitive change. The objective of this study is to develop two alternate versions of the MoCA (Hong Kong version; HK-MoCA) and to investigate the validity and reliability of the alternate versions in patients with DSM-5 Mild Neurocognitive Disorder (Mild NCD) and cognitively healthy controls.METHODS: Concurrent validity and inter-scale agreement were examined by Pearson correlation of the total scores between the original and alternate versions and the Bland-Altman Method. Criterion validity of the two alternate versions in differentiating patients with Mild NCD was tested using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. One-month test-retest and inter-rater reliability were examined in 20 participants. Internal consistency of the alternate versions was measured by the Cronbach's a.RESULTS: 30 controls (age 73.4 [4.5] years, 60% female) and 30 patients (age 75.4 [5.5] years, 73% female) with Mild NCD were recruited. Both alternate versions significantly correlated with the original version (r = 0.79-0.87, p&lt;0.001). Mean differences of 0.17 and -0.40 points were found between the total scores of the alternate with the original versions with a consistent level of agreement observed throughout the range of cognitive abilities. Both alternate versions significantly differentiated patients with Mild NCD from healthy controls (area under ROC 0.922 and 0.724, p&lt;0.001) and showed good one-month test-retest reliability (intra-class correlation [ICC] = 0.92 and 0.82) and inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.99 and 0.87) and high internal consistency (Cronbach a = 0.79 and 0.75).CONCLUSION: The two alternate versions of the HK-MoCA are useful for Mild NCD screening."
"29790199","Relationship between cumulative ultraviolet exposure and cognitive function in a rural elderly Chinese population.","OBJECTIVES: Some researchers have focused on the relationship between vitamin D and cognition, but the conclusions are inconsistent. We estimated cumulative UV exposure could be used to represent the individual's long-term vitamin D status and investigated its association with global cognitive function in elderly Chinese.METHODS: A total of 641 participants aged 60 years and over were recruited in a rural area of Shenyang, China. All were interviewed to obtain data regarding sociodemographic characteristics and time spent outdoors. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Beijing version (MoCA-BJ). Images of skin from UV-exposed (dorsal hand) and UV-protected (inner forearm) sites from each individual were graded by the Beagley-Gibson system. Differences in skin-grade between the 2 sites were used to indicate cumulative UV exposure level. Subjects were grouped in tertiles based on skin-grade differences (&lt;1.75, 1.75-2.74, and = 2.75), representing low, medium, and high UV exposure levels, respectively. The MoCA-BJ score was classified in tertiles as low (&lt;19), middle (19-22), and high (=23) levels of cognition. Associations between cognitive function and UV exposure were analyzed using ordinal regression.RESULTS: Skin-grade differences were associated with self-reported time spent outdoors. After adjustment for age, gender, education, BMI, whether living alone, income, diet, hypertension, and diabetes, a high UV exposure level was associated with better cognitive function (odds ratio = 0.643, 95% confidence interval = 0.427-0.969).CONCLUSIONS: Greater cumulative UV exposure appears to be associated with better cognitive function in elderly adults."

Those with dementia were excluded as well as those with depression, which were screened out by the Thai Geriatric Depression Scale (TGDS-15). Mild cognitive impairment was diagnosed and confirmed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and joint agreement between a psychiatrist and a neurologist. The participants were alternately assigned to receive a cognitive training program (intervention group) while the other half received their normal usual therapy (control group). The program involved training of 4 aspects of cognition through 6 sessions; 2 sessions per month for 3 months. The MoCA and TGDS-15 scales were given at baseline and again at week 13, and at months 6 and 9. Independent t-tests were used to compare changes in global cognition among the two groups.RESULTS: MoCA scores at 9 months were significantly higher than at baseline in both groups. However, the mean difference in intervention group was significantly higher than control group. TGDS-15 scores at 6 months was significantly lower than at baseline among the intervention group but not the control group.CONCLUSION: This cognitive training program helped to improve global cognition and reduce depressive symptoms."

The total Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores were compared by age, sex, presence of aura, migraine duration, attack frequency, pain localization, presence and number of WMHs, and the scores of the Beck Depression Inventory and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).RESULTS: Forty-seven (47%) patients had MwA and 53 (53%) had MwoA. The performance of the MwA patients was significantly poorer than that of the MwoA patients and the healthy subjects on the MoCA scales. In particular, the results revealed lower scores in the subscales regarding visuospatial/executive functions, naming, memory, attention, and abstraction in MwA patients than in the MwoA patients. Compared to healthy controls, more number of migraine patients had WMHs. The presence and number of WMHs had no significant correlation with the MoCA scores of the migraine patients. There was a significant correlation of the BAI and BDI scores with the total MoCA scores considering all migraine patients.CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that MwA may be associated with low cognitive performance which was correlated with depression and anxiety but not with WMHs. Further, longitudinal studies for assessing the relationship between WMHs, cognitive functions, and migraine, and for establishing the causality are warranted."
"29768473","Impaired serial ordering in nondemented patients with mild Parkinson's disease.","The ability to arrange thoughts and actions in an appropriate serial order (the problem of serial order) is essential to complex behaviors such as language, reasoning and cognitive planning. Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) perform poorly in tasks that rely on the successful rearrangement of working memory representations. We hypothesized that serial ordering is impaired in nondemented patients with mild PD. We recruited 49 patients with mild idiopathic PD (Hoehn and Yahr Scale 1-2.5) and 51 matched healthy adults. Nineteen patients had normal global cognition (PD-NC, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA=26/30) and thirty patients had mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, 21=MoCA=25). All participants underwent three working memory assessments: two experimental tests that require reordering random digits following a particular rule (adaptive digit ordering test and digit span backward test) and a control test that requires maintaining but no reordering (digit span forward test). PD-NC and PD-MCI patients performed significantly worse (with lower test scores and larger ordering costs) than healthy controls in both digit ordering and backward tests, although they performed normally in the forward test. The ordering cost increased as a function of age across groups, indicating an aging-related decline in the ability of serial ordering. However, individual patients' task performances were not correlated with their severity or duration of motor symptoms, or daily exposure to dopaminergic drugs. These results suggested that serial ordering deficits exist in early stages of PD, prior to subtle changes in global cognition and in parallel with motor symptoms."

The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between serum vitamin D and cognition as measured via the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in a healthy, older population. The study sample consisted of 4358 patients from the Cooper Clinic in Dallas, TX. All participants underwent a maximal graded exercise test to determine cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). Cognitive impairment was defined as a MoCA score &lt;25. Low vitamin D status was defined as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;30<U+202F>ng/mL. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was employed to evaluate the association between vitamin D blood level and MoCA score. A low MoCA score was directly associated with higher age (OR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.53, 1.99), and inversely associated with female sex (OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.77), and years of education (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.84, 0.91). When controlling for significant predictors (age, sex, and education), the low vitamin D group had a significantly greater likelihood of having a low MoCA score (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.51). The vitamin D effect remained significant when CRF was added to the model (OR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.48). In conclusion, low vitamin D was shown to be associated with cognitive impairment. Therefore, preventive measures such as vitamin D supplementation may play a protective role in memory loss and/or age-associated cognitive decline."

Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), ganglion cell layer (GCL) and inner plexiform layer (IPL) thickness were assessed using optical coherence tomography. These measurements in HIV subjects were compared to those in controls. Age and gender related changes were compared in both groups. Other variables studied in HIV subjects included: duration of HIV infection, CD4+ cell count nadir, antiretroviral therapy regimen and cognitive status using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)Test.RESULTS: 69 subjects, 34 with and 35 without cognitive impairment, and 70 controls were enrolled. GCL was significantly thinner in CI-HIV subjects compared to NCI-HIV subjects and controls (p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.01 and p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.02 respectively). GCL and IPL thickness significantly decreased with age in subjects with HIV (p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.0003, p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.02 respectively for the entire cohort). This change was not seen in controls. MoCA Test score significantly decreased with age in HIV subjects and controls. GCL thickness positively correlated with cognitive function across the entire HIV cohort (p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.02).CONCLUSIONS: GCL was thinner in HIV subjects with cognitive impairment. GCL thickness correlated positively with cognitive function and negatively with age in HIV subjects. GCL thickness may reflect accelerated cognitive aging in HIV."

Those with dementia were excluded as well as those with depression, which were screened out by the Thai Geriatric Depression Scale (TGDS-15). Mild cognitive impairment was diagnosed and confirmed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and joint agreement between a psychiatrist and a neurologist. The participants were alternately assigned to receive a cognitive training program (intervention group) while the other half received their normal usual therapy (control group). The program involved training of 4 aspects of cognition through 6 sessions; 2 sessions per month for 3 months. The MoCA and TGDS-15 scales were given at baseline and again at week 13, and at months 6 and 9. Independent t-tests were used to compare changes in global cognition among the two groups.RESULTS: MoCA scores at 9 months were significantly higher than at baseline in both groups. However, the mean difference in intervention group was significantly higher than control group. TGDS-15 scores at 6 months was significantly lower than at baseline among the intervention group but not the control group.CONCLUSION: This cognitive training program helped to improve global cognition and reduce depressive symptoms."
"29722955","Increased Iron Deposition on Brain Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping Correlates with Decreased Cognitive Function in Alzheimer's Disease.","The excessive accumulation of iron in deep gray structures is an important pathological characteristic in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is more specific than other imaging-based iron measurement modalities and allows noninvasive assessment of tissue magnetic susceptibility, which has been shown to correlate well with brain iron levels. This study aimed to investigate the correlations between the magnetic susceptibility values of deep gray matter nuclei and the cognitive functions assessed by mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) in patients with mild and moderate AD. Thirty subjects with mild and moderate AD and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were scanned with a 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. The magnetic susceptibilities of the regions of interest (ROIs), including caudate nucleus (Cd), putamen (Pt), globus pallidus (Gp), thalamus (Th), red nucleus (Rn), substantia nigra (Sn), and dentate nucleus (Dn), were quantified by QSM. We found that the susceptibility values of the bilateral Cd and Pt were significantly higher in AD patients than the controls ( P &lt; 0.05). In contrast, bilateral Rn had significantly lower susceptibility values in AD than the controls. Regardless of gender and age, the increase of magnetic susceptibility in the left Cd was significantly correlated with the decrease of MMSE scores and MoCA scores ( P &lt; 0.05). Our study indicated that magnetic susceptibility value of left Cd could be potentially used as a biomarker of disease severity in mild and moderate AD."

However, the characteristics of these complications in LRRK2 (leucine-rich kinase 2)-associated PD patients still lack systematic research. The purpose of this study is to assess visual functions of LRRK2-associated PD patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five (25) PD patients with LRRK2 R1628P and G2385R variants were included in the study and compared to 28 PD patients without these variants and 28 age-matched healthy controls. The genotypes of PD patients were kept double-blinded. Information on age, sex, disease duration, the movement disorder society-unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (MDS-UPDRS), Hoehn and Yahr staging scale (H&amp;Y), Mini-Mental Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were included. Visual functions assessment included color perception, contrast sensitivity and stereopsis.RESULTS: PD patients with or without LRRK2 R1628P and G2385R variants have declined contrast sensitivity, diminished color discrimination and damaged stereopsis. There was no significant difference in retinal level visual deficiency (color discrimination and contrast sensitivity) between PD with LRRK2 variants and those without, but cortex level visual function, i.e. stereopsis is better in PD with LRRK2 variants than non-carrier PD patients. The associated factors of stereopsis are different. The stereopsis is associated with MoCA scores independently in non-carrier PD patients, but with UPDRSIII scores in LRRK2-associated PD patients.CONCLUSIONS: Visual functions are similarly affected in PD patients with and without LRRK2 R1628P and G2385R variants, but LRRK2-associated PD patients have better stereopsis than idiopathic PD patients."
"29701936","The Impact of Captivity and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder on Cognitive Performance Among Former Prisoners of War: A Longitudinal Study.","OBJECTIVE: War captivity is a potent pathogen for various aspects of mental health, including cognitive impairments. However, little is known about the long-term impact of war captivity and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on cognitive functioning among former prisoners of war (ex-POWs). This study assesses the effect of captivity, PTSD trajectories, and the accumulating differential effect in the prediction of cognitive performance.METHODS: This longitudinal research includes 4 assessments (1991 [T1], 2003 [T2], 2008 [T3], 2015 [T4]) of Israeli ex-POWs and comparable combatants from the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Accordingly, 95 ex-POWs and 26 comparable combatants were included in this study. PTSD was assessed according to the DSM-IV, and cognitive performance was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).RESULTS: Ex-POWs reported higher levels of PTSD symptoms compared to controls (P = 0.007). No difference was found between the groups regarding MoCA total score. Ex-POWs with chronic PTSD were found to have more difficulty in overall cognitive functioning, compared to ex-POWs with delayed, recovery, and resilient trajectories (P = 0.03). Finally, physical and psychological suffering in captivity and intrusion symptoms predicted cognitive performance (P &lt; .001, R² = 37.9%). These findings support the potent pathogenic effects of war captivity on cognitive abilities, more than 4 decades after the end of the traumatic event.CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed captivity to be a unique and powerful traumatic experience, leading to PTSD and long-lasting and enduring neuropsychological implications. These findings highlight the importance of viewing ex-POWs, in particular those suffering from chronic PTSD, especially as they age, as a high-risk population for cognitive disorders. This requires the appropriate diagnosis and cognitive therapy as a way to preserve cognitive abilities among this population."

However, previous investigations have not utilized comprehensible variables thought to have negative effect on oral perception, including aging, denture wearing, and cognitive function. The aim of this study was to elucidate the impact of cognitive function on oral perception in independently living older individuals.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study sample was comprised of 987 participants (466 males, 521 females; age 69-71 years). Oral examinations, assessments of cognitive function in preclinical level by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)-J, and determination of oral stereognostic ability as an indicator of oral perception were performed. Related variables were selected by univariate analyses; then, multivariate logistic regression model analysis was conducted.RESULTS: Univariate analyses revealed that number of teeth, removable dentures usage, and cognitive function respectively had a significant relationship with stereognostic score. Next, the subjects were classified into good and poor perception groups (lowest 17.4%) according to oral stereognostic ability. Logistic regression analysis revealed that lower cognitive function was significantly associated with poor oral perception (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.934, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.017) after controlling for other variables.CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive decline even in preclinical stage was associated with reduced oral perception after controlling for gender, tooth number and denture use in independent living older people.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study suggested that preclinical level of change in cognitive function affected oral perception. Dental practitioners and caregivers may need to pay attention to reduced oral perception among older people even if they do not have trouble in daily life."

Thirty patients undergoing hemodialysis and 30 matched reference group of apparently healthy control were included. All subjects underwent the K-MoCA, K-MMSE and a neuropsychological test battery to measure attention, visuospatial function, language, memory and executive function. All cognitive data were converted to z-scores with appropriate age and education level prior to group comparisons. Cognitive performance 1.0 SD below the mean was defined as modest cognitve impairment while 1.5 below the mean was defined as severe cognitive impairment. Modest cognitive impairment in memory plus other cognitive domains was detected in 27 patients (90%) while severe cognitive impairment in memory plus other cognitive domains was detected in 23 (77%) patients. Total scores in the K-MoCA were significantly lower in HD patients than in the reference group. However, no significant group difference was found in the K-MMSE. The K-MMSE ROC AUC (95% confidence interval) was 0.72 (0.59-0.85) and K-MoCA ROC AUC was 0.77 (0.65-0.89). Cognitive impairment is common but under-diagnosed in this population.

However, patients experience difficulties in maintaining these cycling training programs. The present study investigated the efficacy of cycling at a mild-to-moderate intensity in early-stage PD.METHODS: Thirteen PD patients were enrolled for 16 serial cycling sessions over a 2-month period. Motor function was assessed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS III) and Timed Up and Go (TUG) test as primary outcomes. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), modified Hoehn and Yahr Stage (mHYS), total UPDRS, Falls Efficacy Scale, New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire, Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living, 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire, Patient Global Impression of Change, and gait performance were assessed as secondary outcomes.RESULTS: The age and the age at onset were 59.67±7.24 and 53.23±10.26 years (mean±SD), respectively. The cycling cadence was 53.27±8.92 revolutions per minute. The UPDRS III score improved significantly after 8 training sessions (p=0.011) and 16 training sessions (T2) (p=0.001) in the off-state, and at T2 (p=0.004) in the on-state compared to pretraining (T0). The TUG duration was significantly shorter at T2 than at T0 (p&lt;0.05). The findings of MoCA, total UPDRS, double limb support time, and mHYS (in both the off- and on-states) also improved significantly at T2.CONCLUSIONS: Our pioneer study has demonstrated that a low-intensity progressive cycling exercise can improve motor function in PD, especially akinesia.

LRRK2 G2019S is amongst the most common genetic etiologies for PD, particularly in Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) populations.METHODS: This cross-sectional data collection study sought to clarify the phenotype of LRRK2 G2019S mutation carriers with PD. Primary endpoints were the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Other motor and non-motor data were also assessed. The Mann-Whitney U Test was utilized to compare LRRK2 G2019S carriers with PD (LRRK2+) with non-carrier PD controls who were matched for age, gender, education, and PD duration. Survival analyses and log rank tests were utilized to compare interval from onset of PD to development of motor and non-motor complications.RESULTS: We screened 251 subjects and 231 completed the study, of whom 9 were LRRK2+, including 7 AJ subjects. 22.73% of AJ subjects with a family history of PD (FH) and 12.96% of AJ subjects without a FH were LRRK2+. There were no significant differences between the 9 LRRK2+ subjects and 19 matched PD controls in MDS-UPDRS, MoCA, or other motor and non-motor endpoints.CONCLUSION: Prevalence of the LRRK2 G2019S mutation in AJ and non-AJ subjects in our study population in Cleveland, Ohio was comparable to other clinical studies. There were no significant motor or non-motor differences between LRRK2+ PD and matched PD controls."

"29614702","High Prevalence of Undiagnosed Insulin Resistance in Non-Diabetic Subjects with Parkinson's Disease.","BACKGROUND: Reduced glucose tolerance has been long recognized as a potential risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), and increasing scrutiny is currently being placed on insulin resistance (IR) as a pathologic driver of neurodegeneration. However, the prevalence of IR in PD is unknown.OBJECTIVE: To determine IR prevalence in non-diabetic patients with PD and to correlate IR with other metabolic indicators, motor and non-motor symptoms (NMS) of PD, and quality of life (QoL).METHODS: Non-diabetic patients with a diagnosis of PD were identified and tested for fasting insulin, fasting glucose, and HbA1c. Patients were also offered to take a battery of clinical tests (MoCA, NMSQ, and PDQ-39) and had their PD medications, height, weight, and other demographic features recorded. IR was defined as HOMA-IR=2.0 and/or HbA1c=5.7. IR abnormalities were correlated with BMI and demographic features, in addition to motor and NMS.RESULTS: 154 subjects (109 M, 45F, mean age 67.7±10.5) were included in this study. Mean HOMA-IR was 2.3±1.8. Ninety out of 154 (58.4%) subjects had abnormal IR. IR was more frequent in overweight and obese subjects (61.1% and 82.8% respectively) than normal weight subjects (41.5%). Multivariate analysis showed that BMI was the only significant predictor of IR (p<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>0.0001). There was no significant correlation between HOMA-IR and MoCA, PDQ-39, and NMSQ scores.CONCLUSIONS: IR is prevalent in PD and it correlates with BMI. A correlation between IR with cognitive and QoL measures cannot be determined on the basis of this sample."
"29608442","Cognitive assessment of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate cognitive performance for the first time in participants with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: In total, 70 participants with NAFLD and 73 age-matched and sex-matched healthy participants were enrolled in this prospective cross-sectional study. The diagnosis of NAFLD was made on the basis of abdominal ultrasonography findings. Anthropometric indices were calculated, and routine laboratory analyses were carried out for each participant. All participants provided sociodemographic data and completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Cognitive functions were evaluated using the Turkish version of the MoCA, with a cut-off score for mild cognitive impairment of less than 21 points.RESULTS: The MoCA scores were significantly lower in participants with NAFLD than in the healthy group (P&lt;0.05). In addition, more NAFLD participants than healthy participants presented with deficits in the visuospatial (P&lt;0.05) and executive function domains (P&lt;0.05). In the multivariate model, education level [2.79 (1.12-6.96); P&lt;0.05] and area of residence [5.68 (2.24-14.38); P&lt;0.001] were associated independently with cognitive dysfunction in both the NAFLD and the healthy groups. The MoCA scores were correlated negatively with fibrosis 4 scores in NAFLD participants (r=-0.359; P&lt;0.05). However, hepatosteatosis grade and the presence of metabolic syndrome were not correlated with MoCA scores in the NAFLD group (P&gt;0.05).CONCLUSION: Our results show that NAFLD patients may have early or subtle cognitive dysfunction, including in the visuospatial and executive function domains, as indexed by scores on the MoCA test. Further targeted psychometric testing will be required to confirm the presence of cognitive impairment in this population."

Fifty-eight patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease undergoing stenting in Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital were selected and randomly divided into control group (n=29) and dexmedetomidine group (n=29). The dexmedetomidine group was treated with dexmedetomidine before induced anesthesia, while the control group was given the same dose of normal saline; and the normal volunteers of the same age were selected as the normal group (n=29). At 3 days after operation, the levels of serum S100B and nerve growth factor (NGF) in each group were detected using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was detected via western blotting. Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and attention network test (ANT) were performed. Moreover, the cognitive function and attention network function, and the effects of dexmedetomidine on cognitive function and attention network function were evaluated. The concentrations of serum S100B and NGF in dexmedetomidine group was lower than those in control group (P&lt;0.01). The results of western blotting showed that the levels of serum BDNF in control group and dexmedetomidine group were significantly lower than that in normal group (P&lt;0.01), and it was higher in dexmedetomidine group than that in control group (P&lt;0.01). Besides, both MoCA and ANT results revealed that the visual space and executive function scores, attention scores, delayed memory scores, targeted network efficiency and executive control network efficiency in dexmedetomidine group were obviously higher than those in control group (P&lt;0.01). The cognitive function and attention network function of patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease have a certain degree of damage, and the preoperative administration of dexmedetomidine can effectively improve the patient's cognitive dysfunction and attention network function after operation."
"29581470","Factors associated with cognitive impairment in elderly versus nonelderly patients with metabolic syndrome: the different roles of FGF21.","Increased fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels have been found in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS). MetS is also associated with cognitive decline. However, the correlation between FGF21 and cognitive decline in elderly and nonelderly MetS patients has not been investigated. 116 non-elderly patients (age &lt;65 years old) and 96 elderly patients (=65 years old) with MetS were enrolled. Blood samples for FGF21 were collected from all participants after 12-hour fasting. Cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) test. The MoCA score was negatively associated with age and was different among different levels of education in these MetS patients. In the non-elderly group, body mass index (BMI) showed positively correlated with MoCA score while, FGF21 level and HbA1C were negatively associated with the MoCA score in non-elderly MetS patients. BMI was the only factor which showed a negative correlation with the MoCA score in elderly MetS patients. This study demonstrated that FGF21 level was independently associated with cognitive impairment in non-elderly patients but not in elderly patients. The possible role of FGF21 level in cognitive impairment in non-elderly should be confirmed in a prospective study."

"29575215","Screening an elderly hearing impaired population for mild cognitive impairment using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).","OBJECTIVES: To determine if there is an association between hearing loss and poorer cognitive scores on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and to determine if poor hearing acuity affects scoring on the cognitive screening tests of MMSE and MoCA.METHODS: One hundred fourteen elderly patients (Singapore residents) aged between 55 and 86 years were sampled. Participants completed a brief history questionnaire, pure tone audiometry, and 2 cognitive screening tests-the MMSE and MoCA. Average hearing thresholds of the better ear in the frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz were used for data analysis.RESULTS: Hearing loss was significantly associated with poorer cognitive scores in Poisson regression models adjusted for age. Mini-Mental State Examination scores were shown to decrease by 2.8% (P = .029), and MoCA scores by 3.5% (P = .013) for every 10 dB of hearing loss. Analysis of hearing-sensitive components of &quot;Registration&quot; and &quot;Recall&quot; in MMSE and MoCA using chi-square tests showed significantly poorer performance in the hearing loss group as compared to the normal hearing group. Phonetic analysis of target words with high error rates shows that the poor performance was likely contributed by decreased hearing acuity, on top of a possible true deficit in cognition in the hearing impaired.CONCLUSIONS: Hearing loss is associated with poorer cognitive scores on MMSE and MoCA, and cognitive scoring is likely confounded by poor hearing ability. This highlights an important, often overlooked aspect of sensory impairment during cognitive screening. Provisions should be made when testing for cognition in the hearing-impaired population to avoid over-referral and subsequent misdiagnoses of cognitive impairment."
"29574086","Cerebral gray matter volume losses in essential tremor: A case-control study using high resolution tissue probability maps.","INTRODUCTION: Essential tremor (ET) is increasingly recognized as a multi-dimensional disorder with both motor and non-motor features. For this reason, imaging studies are more broadly examining regions outside the cerebellar motor loop. Reliable detection of cerebral gray matter (GM) atrophy requires optimized processing, adapted to high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We investigated cerebral GM volume loss in ET cases using automated segmentation of MRI T1-weighted images.METHODS: MRI was acquired on 47<U+202F>ET cases and 36 controls. Automated segmentation and voxel-wise comparisons of volume were performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software. To improve upon standard protocols, the high-resolution International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) 2009a atlas and tissue probability maps were used to process each subject image. Group comparisons were performed: all ET vs. Controls, ET with head tremor (ETH) vs. Controls, and severe ET vs. Controls. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed between ET with and without head tremor and controls. Age, sex, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score were regressed out from each comparison.RESULTS: We were able to consistently identify regions of cerebral GM volume loss in ET and in ET subgroups in the posterior insula, superior temporal gyri, cingulate cortex, inferior frontal gyri and other occipital and parietal regions. There were no significant increases in GM volume in ET in any comparisons with controls.CONCLUSION: This study, which uses improved methodologies, provides evidence that GM volume loss in ET is present beyond the cerebellum, and in fact, is widespread throughout the cerebrum as well."

Chronic pain is the prominent characteristic of knee osteoarthritis (KOA), yet little is known about its morphological changes in the brain. Here an MRI study was performed to examine the structural brain abnormalities in 30 KOA patients with knee pain and age-matched healthy subjects. We detected that the patients exhibited significant almost 2-fold age-related decreases of GMV compared to healthy controls. Moreover, KOA patients also had significant loss of regional GMV including in the bilateral orbital frontal cortex (OFC), the right lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC), and precentral and postcentral cortices. In addition, a high proportion of KOA patients exerted abnormal scores of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Mini Mental State examination (MMSE), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) compare to controls.

"29549976","Montreal Cognitive Assessment as a screening instrument for cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.","BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is one of the core features of schizophrenia. For its evaluation, current clinical practice relies on detailed neuropsychological batteries which require trained testers and considerable amount of time to administer. Therefore, a brief and reliable screening tool for identification of overall cognitive impairment prior to a detailed comprehensive neurocognitive assessment is needed in a busy clinical setting. This study evaluates the clinical utility of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in detecting cognitive impairments in schizophrenia and its relationship with functional outcome and demographic characters.METHODS: The MoCA, the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS), and the Brief UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment (UPSA-B) were administered to 64 patients with schizophrenia. Mild and severe cognitive impairments were defined as BACS Z-score (calculated with the age and gender adjustments using previously published local norm data) of one or two standard deviations below the mean, respectively.RESULTS: The results showed that the MoCA was significantly correlated with BACS (r=.61, p&lt;.001) and sensitive to detect both mild (AUC=0.82, p&lt;.001) and severe (AUC=0.81, p&lt;.001) cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. The MoCA was significantly correlated with UPSA-B score (r=.51, p&lt;.001), and accounted for significant additional variance in UPSA-B score beyond the BACS.CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that MoCA is a useful bedside cognitive screening instrument for people with schizophrenia."

We created a portable version of the VPC (P-VPC) and contrasted P-VPC metrics against the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in healthy adults, to assess the validity and reliability of the P-VPC as an indicator of memory function across age. A supplementary case series was conducted with individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias, to provide a preliminary illustration of the P-VPC's use as a measure in clinical populations.METHOD: Participants (n = 207) were tested using the P-VPC. Individuals were familiarized with a set of objects, which were each presented alongside a novel object in the test phase. Novelty viewing scores were compared to MoCA scores to index concurrent validity. Item analyses were conducted as a test of internal reliability of the P-VPC. A complementary clinical case series was conducted with AD (n = 4) and dementia (n = 5) participants, who were tested using the P-VPC and further compared to healthy age-matched participants.RESULTS: Preferential viewing decreased with age in healthy participants, and was positively correlated with MoCA scores. Compared to the MoCA, P-VPC scores did not differ based on education and/or whether English was spoken as the native language. Item analyses revealed acceptable internal consistency. P-VPC viewing percentiles of healthy participants were modeled as a function of age, and illustrated that individuals of the clinical case series diagnosed with AD scored in below-average percentiles, while those with dementia did not score below-average.CONCLUSION: Good concurrent validity and acceptable internal reliability were observed, and P-VPC scores were not confounded by education or language experience. Low performance was observed in individuals with clinically diagnosed AD, suggesting that the P-VPC may be a potential tool for screening memory decline."

"29530493","Neurocognitive deficits in older patients with cancer.","OBJECTIVE: To assess cognitive function in older adults undergoing cancer care.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study, in the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, in older adults undergoing cancer care. Comprehensive geriatric assessments were conducted prior to surgery, chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation, at the Program for Healthy Aging from January 1, 2013 through March 31, 2015. Cognitive assessment was conducted through personal and family interview, and the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA). Functional, physical, nutritional, social support, comorbidity assessment and medication review were conducted.ANALYSIS: Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia were compared to patients who were cognitively intact.RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-two patients underwent geriatric assessment, mean (±SD) age was 78<U+202F>±<U+202F>7<U+202F>years, 121 (63%) had some degree of neurocognitive deficit, with 64 patients (33%) presenting with major neurocognitive deficit (dementia), and 57 cases (30%), minor neurocognitive deficit (MCI). Early stage dementia was evident in 50% of cases, moderate stage in 32%, and severe stage in 18%. The prevalence of dementia and MCI were higher than in the general population studies (70-79<U+202F>years). Associated factors for neurocognitive deficits as compared to older patients with cancer with normal cognition, included a higher comorbidity index (p<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.04), stroke (p<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.03), metastatic disease (p<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.04), and warfarin use (p<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.03).CONCLUSION: Neurocognitive deficits (MCI and dementia) are more common in older adults with cancer. Factors associated with neurocognitive deficits include high comorbidity, stroke, warfarin use and metastatic cancer. Identification and management of these conditions is of great relevance in the course of cancer therapy."
"29529530","Olfactory dysfunction in multiple sclerosis.","BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common chronic neurological disease that causes disability. MS can have various clinical manifestations, one of which is olfactory dysfunction. In clinical practice, olfactory disturbances are usually underdiagnosed. The aim of our study is to assess olfactory function and its relationship with MS disease duration, disability and cognition.METHOD: We assessed 31 MS patients and 24 healthy controls matched in sex and age at our MS outpatient clinic of the Istanbul Education and Research Hospital Neurology Department. Each subject was interviewed to obtain demographic data. The Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC) olfactory test and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) were applied to each participant.RESULTS: The CCCRC test scores of the MS patients were lower than those in the control group (p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.05). Patients with a longer disease duration and more frequent attacks had lower CCCRC scores (p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.05). The Expanded Disability Status Scale scores had no correlation with the CCCRC test scores. The MOCA score was positively correlated with all domains of the olfactory test scores.CONCLUSION: This study supports the presence of olfactory dysfunction in early stages of MS and the correlation of cognitive impairment with olfactory dysfunction, even in the early stages of the disease in young and less physically- disabled patients. The assessment of olfaction may be helpful as a surrogate method for tracking disease progression in patients over time."
"29508103","Utility of Using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as a Screening Tool for HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND) In Multi-Ethnic Malaysia.","This study determines the optimal cut-off scores for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to detect HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) in a multi-ethnic Malaysian HIV-positive cohort by developing demographically corrected normative standards among 283 HIV-negative community-based controls with overlapping demographic characteristics. The norms (corrected for age, sex, education, ethnicity) were applied to 342 HIV-positive virally suppressed individuals on cART. Impairment rates were classified using the Global Deficit Score (GDS<U+2009>=<U+2009>.5) method. The MoCA was also scored according to the recommended cut-off of<U+2009>=<U+2009>26, and functional decline was applied to both impairment definitions to classify HAND per the Frascati criteria. The<U+2009>=<U+2009>26 cut-off considerably overestimated cognitive impairment in both samples (59.4% HIV-negative; 69.3% HIV-positive). In contrast, corrected scores yielded impairment rates consistent with what has been reported internationally in virally suppressed cohorts (23.4% with 83.3% mild impairment, 16.7% moderate impairment). A supplemental file allowing the computation of corrected MoCA scores and impairment status is included."
"29502163","Patients' reported outcome measures and clinical scales in brain tumor surgery: results from a prospective cohort study.","BACKGROUND: This study aims to assess surgical outcome in brain tumor surgery using patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) and to compare their results with traditional clinical outcome measurements.METHOD: Neuro-oncological patients undergoing surgical removal for the lesion were enrolled; MOCA test, PROMs (EUROHIS-QoL, PGWB-S, WHODAS-12), and the clinical scale Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) were administered to evaluate respectively cognitive status, quality of life, well-being, disability, and functional status before surgery and at 3-month follow-up. Wilcoxon test was performed to evaluate the longitudinal change of test scores, the smallest detectable difference to classify the change of patients in PROMs, the Cohen kappa to investigate the concordance between KPS and PROMs in classifying the patients' change, and Mann-Whitney U test to compare patients with complications and no complications.RESULTS: A total of 101 patients were enrolled (54 woman, mean age 50.2<U+2009>±<U+2009>14.1, range 20-85): psychological well-being improved at follow-up; 95 patients (94.1%) were improved/unchanged and 6 (5.9%) were worsened according to PROMs; functional status measured with KPS had a slight agreement with quality of life and disability and no agreement with psychological well-being questionnaires; patients with complications had a greater worsening in KPS.CONCLUSIONS: According to PROMs measuring QoL, disability, and psychological well-being, most of the patients were improved/unchanged after surgery. Since PROMs and KPS detect different aspects of the patients' health status, PROMs should be integrated in surgical outcome evaluation. Furthermore, their association with complications and with other clinical and subjective variables that could influence patient's perception of health status should be investigated."

"29491315","The Clinical Findings Useful for Driving Safety Advice for Parkinson's Disease Patients.","Objective We conducted a study to obtain information that could be used to provide Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with appropriate advice on safe driving. Methods Consecutive PD patients who visited our office were studied. Among these patients, those who had experienced driving after being diagnosed with PD were interviewed by neurologists and a trained nurse to investigate their previous car accidents, motor function, cognitive function, sleepiness, levodopa equivalent dose (LED), and emotional dysregulation. The rates of major car accidents before and after the onset of PD were compared. Results Fifteen patients had experienced a major car accident resulting in human injury or serious property damage since the onset of PD. When the rates of major car accidents before and after the onset of PD were compared, the ratio was 4.3 (95% CI 1.9-9.7). The incidence of accidents after the onset of PD was correlated with age, disease duration, LED, the cognitive function (MMSE, MoCA-J), but not the motor symptom score (UPDRS part III at the time of the study). The Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease (QUIP) score was also higher in patients with major car accidents. Conclusion The severity of symptoms (Hoehn-Yahr classification), cognitive function, and disease duration were expected to be risk factors for car accidents. However, the motor symptom score (UPDRS part III) was not associated with the incidence of major car accidents. In addition to a low cognitive function and the severity of symptoms, the QUIP score might be an independent factor that can be referenced when advising PD patients to refrain from driving."
"29471735","Cognitive impairment in older patients undergoing colorectal surgery.","Background With increasing numbers of older people being referred for elective colorectal surgery, cognitive impairment is likely to be present and affect many aspects of the surgical pathway. This study is aimed to determine the prevalence of cognitive impairment and assess it against surgical outcomes. Methods The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was carried out in patients aged more than 65 years. We recorded demographic information. Data were collected on length of hospital stay, complications and 30-day mortality. Results There were 101 patients assessed, median age was 74 years (interquartile range<U+2009>=<U+2009>68-80), 54 (53.5%) were women. In total, 58 people (57.4%) 'failed' the Montreal Cognitive Assessment test (score<U+2009>=<U+2009>25). There were two deaths (3.4%) within 30 days of surgery in the abnormal Montreal Cognitive Assessment group and none in the normal group. Twenty-nine (28.7%) people experienced a complication. The percentage of patients with complications was higher in the group with normal Montreal Cognitive Assessment (41.9%) than abnormal Montreal Cognitive Assessment (19.9%) ( p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01) and the severity of those complications were greater (chi-squared for trend p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01). The length of stay was longer in people with an abnormal Montreal Cognitive Assessment (mean 8.1 days vs. 5.8 days, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.03). Conclusion Cognitive impairment was common, which has implications for informed consent. Cognitive impairment was associated with less postoperative complications but a longer length of hospital stay."
"29455207","Cognitive Function Declines Significantly during Haemodialysis in a Majority of Patients: A Call for Further Research.","INTRODUCTION: Cognitive impairment (CI) is very common condition that occurs in haemodialysis patients and it is associated with reduced functional capacity and mortality. We assessed the change in cognitive function during haemodialysis and associated risk factors.METHODS: All patients =50 years, on haemodialysis for =3 months, no dementia from 2 dialysis centres were selected. Cognition was assessed before and after a haemodialysis session using parallel versions of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) tool. Multiple regression was used to examine potential confounders.RESULTS: Eight-two patients completed both tests - median age 73 (52-91) years, 59% male, dialysis vintage 41 (3-88) months. Sixty-two (76%) had CI at baseline. Cognition declined over dialysis (MOCA 21 ± 4.8 to 19.1 ± 4.1, p &lt; 0.001) and domains affected were attention, language, abstraction and delayed recall. Age and dialysis vintage were independently associated with decline.CONCLUSION: Cognitive function declines over a haemodialysis session and this has significant clinical implications over health literacy, self-management and tasks like driving. More research is needed to find the cause for this decline in cognition."
"29444740","Associations between modifiable lifestyle factors and multidimensional cognitive health among community-dwelling old adults: stratified by educational level.","BACKGROUND: Cognition is multidimensional, and each domain plays a unique and crucial part in successful daily life engagement. However, less attention has been paid to multi-domain cognitive health for the elderly, and the role of lifestyle factors in each domain remains unclear.METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 3,230 older adults aged 60+ years in Xiamen, China, in 2016. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to measure general cognition and six specific sub-domains. To account for educational effects, we adjusted the MoCA score and divided respondents into three education-specific groups (low, moderate, and high education groups with =5, 6~8, and =9 years of education, respectively). A series of proportional odds models were used to detect the associations between two categories of lifestyle factors - substance abuse (cigarette and alcohol) and leisure activity (TV watching, reading, smartphone use, social activity, and exercise) - and general cognition and the six sub-domains in those three groups.RESULTS: Among the 3,230 respondents, 2,617 eligible participants were included with a mean age of 69.05 ± 7.07 years. Previous or current smoking/drinking was not associated with MoCA scores in the whole population, but unexpectedly, the ex-smokers in the low education group performed better in general cognition (OR = 2.22) and attention (OR = 2.05) than their never-smoking counterparts. Modest TV watching, reading, and smartphone use also contributed to better cognition among elderly participants in the low education group. For the highly educated elderly, comparatively longer reading (&gt;3.5 hours/week) was inversely associated with general cognition (OR = 0.53), memory (OR = 0.59), and language (OR = 0.54), while adequate exercise (5~7 days/week) was positively related to these factors with OR = 1.48, OR = 1.49, and OR = 1.53, respectively. For the moderately educated elderly, only modest reading was significantly beneficial.CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle factors play different roles in multidimensional cognitive health in different educational groups, indicating that individual intervention strategies should be designed according to specific educational groups and different cognitive sub-domains."
"29439251","Low Cerebral Oxygenation Is Associated with Cognitive Impairment in Chronic Hemodialysis Patients.","AIMS: High rates of cognitive impairment (CI) are an alarming problem in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis (HD). Its pathophysiology remains unclear and there are indications that brain ischemia might be one of the key causes. Cerebral tissue oxygenation, as measured by near-infrared spectroscopy, is known to be decreased in HD patients. However, it is unknown whether CI is associated or not associated with lower cerebral oxygenation in these patients. The primary aim of our study was to probe this possible association. Our secondary aim was to assess other factors possibly related to cerebral ischemia and CI.METHODS: Thirty-nine patients treated by chronic HD were included in this cross-sectional study. All measurements were performed before the initiation of an HD session. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was administered according to published recommendations. Regional saturation of oxygen (rSO2) of the left frontal lobe was measured using the INVOS 5100C device. Basic medical history and laboratory data were recorded, and handgrip strength was analyzed. We used the unpaired t test to compare the rSO2 and other variables between cognitively normal patients (MoCA score =26) and those who displayed CI (MoCA score &lt;26). Multiple linear regression analysis was used to adjust for principal confounders.RESULTS: Cognitively impaired patients had lower brain rSO2 values compared to cognitively normal patients (48 ± 9 vs. 57 ± 10%, p = 0.01). Among other variables, higher red cell distribution width (15.8 ± 1.9 vs. 13.8 ± 1.6%, p = 0.01) and lower hand grip strength (49.2 ± 23.3 vs. 99.3 ± 31.4 lbs, p &lt; 0.001) also displayed a significant association with CI. The relation between rSO2 and MoCA score was significant after adjustment for age and gender (p = 0.007).CONCLUSION: Decreased brain oxygenation is associated with weaker cognitive performance in patients undergoing chronic HD. Further understanding the causes of cerebral ischemia in HD patients could lead to the prevention of cognitive decline in this population."
"29430766","Normative data for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Memory Index Score (MoCA-MIS) in Brazil: Adjusting the nonlinear effects of education with fractional polynomials.","OBJECTIVE: To provide age-corrected and education-corrected norms for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Memory Index Score (MoCA-MIS) in Brazil.METHODS: Community-dwelling outpatients were enrolled if they had no history of neurologic or psychiatric diseases and were not taking any drugs with effects on the central nervous system. Dementia has been excluded with the Functional Activities Questionnaire. The final sample consisted of 597 cognitively healthy Brazilians aged 50 to 90 years. To account for nonlinear relationships, we have used fractional polynomials that provide a flexible parameterization for continuous variables.RESULTS: According to the original proposed cutoff (=25 points), 87% of our sample would be considered impaired. Even using a more conservative suggestion (=22 points), 67% of our normative sample would be regarded as impaired. These data reinforce the need of adjusting cutoffs for schooling in populations with heterogeneous educational backgrounds. MoCA scores presented a nonlinear positive association with education tending to a plateau at higher levels (P &lt; 0.001). On the other hand, MoCA-MIS scores presented a nonlinear negative relationship with age, with an accelerated pattern at higher age levels (P &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: We presented normative data for the MoCA and the MoCA-MIS that will facilitate the use of the test in Brazil and, potentially, in other populations with substantial proportions of low-educated individuals. Moreover, we described a systematic approach for adjusting the effects of age and education using fractional polynomials and provided suggestions on how to account for the nonlinear relationship that is frequently encountered between demographic factors and measures of cognitive performance."
"29427575","Rhythm Perception and Production Abilities and Their Relationship to Gait After Stroke.","OBJECTIVES: To assess rhythm abilities, to describe their relation to clinical presentation, and to determine if rhythm production independently contributes to temporal gait asymmetry (TGA) poststroke.DESIGN: Cross-sectional.SETTING: Large urban rehabilitation hospital and university.PARTICIPANTS: Individuals (N=60) with subacute and chronic stroke (n=39) and data for healthy adults extracted from a preexisting database (n=21).INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Stroke group: National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment (CMSA) leg and foot scales, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), rhythm perception and production (Beat Alignment Test [BAT]), and spatiotemporal gait parameters were assessed. TGA was quantified with the swing time symmetry ratio. Healthy group: age and beat perception scores assessed by the BAT. Rhythm perception of the stroke group and healthy adults was compared with analysis of variance. Spearman correlations quantified the relation between rhythm perception and production abilities and clinical measures. Multiple linear regression assessed the contribution of rhythm production along with motor impairment and time poststroke to TGA.CONCLUSIONS: Rhythm perception is impaired after stroke, and temporal gait asymmetry relates to impairments in producing rhythmic movement. These results may have implications for the use of auditory rhythmic stimuli to cue motor responses poststroke. Future work will explore brain responses to rhythm processing poststroke."

"29392877","Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment cut-off score to clarify improvement of mild cognitive impairment after exercise training in community-dwelling older adults.","AIM: Physical exercise improves cognitive function in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, information about whether the degree of MCI before exercise training affects improvement in cognitive function is lacking. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the cut-off value in a MCI screening tool that predicts reversal to normal cognitive function after exercise training in older adults with MCI.METHODS: Participants included 112 Japanese community-dwelling older adult outpatients (37 men, 75 women; mean age 76.3<U+2009>years). We administered the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J) before and after exercise training. MCI was defined as a MoCA-J score &lt;26. All participants underwent exercise training 2<U+2009>days per week for 6<U+2009>months, according to American Heart Association guidelines.RESULTS: The prevalence of MCI was 65.2%. After exercise training, 46.6% of participants with MCI reversed to normal cognitive function. The MoCA-J cut-off score to predict cognitive function potentially reversible to normal was 23, with receiver operating characteristic analysis showing an area under the curve of 0.80, sensitivity of 79.4% and specificity of 69.2%. Multiple logistic regression analysis to predict non-MCI after exercise training showed that MoCA-J score =23 (OR 6.9, P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.001), female sex (OR 3.4, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.04) and age (OR 0.9, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.04) were independent determinants.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA-J cut-off score of 23 might be useful to predict cognitive function that is potentially reversible to normal among community-dwelling Japanese older adults with MCI.

"29364897","Slower saccadic reading in Parkinson's disease.","Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (PD) is characterized by degeneration of dopaminergic and other neurons, leading to motor and non-motor deficits. Abnormal eye movements in PD, including fixations, saccades, and convergence, are well described. However, saccadic reading, which requires serial and alternating saccades and fixations, is not well studied, despite its obvious impact on the quality of life. In this study, we assessed saccadic reading using variations of the King-Devick (KD) test, a rapid single digit number naming test, as a way to assess the ability to make serial left-to-right ocular motor movements necessary for reading. We recruited 42 treated PD patients and 80 age-matched controls and compared their reading times with a variety of measures, including age, duration of disease, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the National Eye Institute 25-Item Visual Functioning Questionnaire 25 (VFQ-25), and Montreal Cognitive assessment (MoCA) test. The subjects performed 4 trials of reading 120 single digit numbers aloud as fast as possible without making errors. In each trial, they read 3 pages (KD1, KD2, and KD3), and each page contained 40 numbers per page in 8 lines with 5 numbers/line. We found that PD patients read about 20% slower than controls on all tests (KD1, 2, and 3 tests) (p &lt; 0.02), and both groups read irregularly spaced numbers slower than regularly spaced numbers. Having lines between numbers to guide reading (KD1 tests) did not impact reading time in both PD and controls, but increased visual crowding as a result of decreased spacing between numbers (KD3 tests) was associated with significantly slower reading times in both PD and control groups. Our study revealed that saccadic reading is slower in PD, but controls and PD patients are both impacted by visuospatial planning challenges posed by increased visual crowding and irregularity of number spacing. Reading time did not correlate with UPDRS or MoCA scores in PD patients but significantly correlated with age, duration of disease, and VFQ-25 scores. The presence of convergence insufficiency did not significantly correlate with reading time in PD patients, although on average there was slower reading time in those with convergence insufficiency by 8 s (p = 0.2613). We propose that a simple reading task using 120 single-digit numbers can be used as a screening tool in the clinical setting to assess functional ocular motor difficulties in Parkinson's disease that can have a profound impact on quality of life."

We performed MMSE and MoCA-INA for assessment of cognitive function and the time between each test was at least 30 minutes.RESULTS: The study included 83 subjects which were consisted of 46 (55.4%) males and 37 (44.6%) females. The mean age was 69.19 ± 4.23 ranging from 65 to 79 years old. The average MMSE scores was 24.96 ± 3.38 (range 14 to 30). The average MoCA-INA scores was 21.06 ± 4.56 (range 5 to 30). The Pearson correlation coefficient between the scores was 0.71 (p&lt;0.005). There were no significant differences of both scores based on history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and previous stroke, but there was a significant difference in MMSE scores based on level of education.CONCLUSION: The MoCA-INA score showed a good correlation with the MMSE score. Both tests showed comparable results but MoCA-INA showed lower average with wider range of scores."
"29358749","Impaired Functional Criticality of Human Brain during Alzheimer's Disease Progression.","The progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) has been proposed to comprise three stages, subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD. Was brain dynamics across the three stages smooth? Was there a critical transition? How could we characterize and study functional criticality of human brain? Based on dynamical characteristics of critical transition from nonlinear dynamics, we proposed a vertex-wise Index of Functional Criticality (vIFC) of fMRI time series in this study. Using 42 SCD, 67 amnestic MCI (aMCI), 34 AD patients as well as their age-, sex-, years of education-matched 54 NC, our new method vIFC successfully detected significant patient-normal differences for SCD and aMCI, as well as significant negative correlates of vIFC in the right middle temporal gyrus with total scores of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in SCD. In comparison, standard deviation of fMRI time series only detected significant differences between AD patients and normal controls. As an index of functional criticality of human brain derived from nonlinear dynamics, vIFC could serve as a sensitive neuroimaging marker for future studies; considering much more vIFC impairments in aMCI compared to SCD and AD, our study indicated aMCI as a critical stage across AD progression."

"29343241","Clinical features and dysfunctions of iron metabolism in Parkinson disease patients with hyper echogenicity in substantia nigra: a cross-sectional study.","BACKGROUND: Transcranial ultrasound is a useful tool for providing the evidences for the early diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Parkinson disease (PD). However, the relationship between hyper echogenicity in substantia nigra (SN) and clinical symptoms of PD patients remains unknown, and the role of dysfunction of iron metabolism on the pathogenesis of SN hyper echogenicity is unclear.METHODS: PD patients was detected by transcranial sonography and divided into with no hyper echogenicity (PDSN-) group and with hyper echogenicity (PDSN+) group. Motor symptoms (MS) and non-motor symptoms (NMS) were evaluated, and the levels of iron and related proteins in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were detected for PD patients. Data comparison between the two groups and correlation analyses were performed.RESULTS: PDSN+ group was significantly older, and had significantly older age of onset, more advanced Hohen-Yahr stage, higher SCOPA-AUT score and lower MoCA score than PDSN- group (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). Compared with PDSN- group, the levels of transferrin and light-ferritin in serum and iron level in CSF were significantly elevated (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05), but ferroportin level in CSF was significantly decreased in PDSN+ group (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05).CONCLUSIONS: PD patients with hyper echogenicity in SN are older, at more advanced disease stage, have severer motor symptoms, and non-motor symptoms of cognitive impairment and autonomic dysfunction. Hyper echogenicity of SN in PD patients is related to dysfunction of iron metabolism, involving increased iron transport from peripheral system to central nervous system, reduction of intracellular iron release and excessive iron deposition in brain."

Poor physical health, functional status, and depression were also associated with lower cognitive performance; current health behaviors were not. Using the recommended MoCA cut-point score for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MoCA score &lt;26; MoCA-SA score &lt;17), 72% (95% confidence interval, 69% to 74%) of older US adults would be classified as having some degree of cognitive impairment.CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide an important national estimate for interpreting MoCA scores from individual patients, and establish wide variability in cognition among older home-dwelling US adults. Care should be taken in applying previously-established MoCA cut-points to the general population, especially when evaluating individuals from educationally and ethnically diverse groups."

"29319601","The MoCA-Memory Index Score: An Efficient Alternative to Paragraph Recall for the Detection of Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment.","OBJECTIVE: To compare ability of 2 measures of delayed memory (word list, story paragraph) to discriminate Normal Control (NC) subjects from those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI).METHODS: Demographic, neuropsychological, and diagnostic data contributed by 34 Alzheimer's Disease Centers to the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center characterized 2717 individuals with a diagnosis of either NC (n=2205) or aMCI (n=512). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Memory Index Score (MoCA-MIS) assessed delayed word recall, and the Craft Story 21, delayed story recall. Logistic regression and receiver operator characteristic curves controlling for age, sex, and education assessed the ability of each test to differentiate NCs from subjects with aMCI.RESULTS: The MoCA-MIS had significantly better sensitivity and specificity (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve 0.83 vs. 0.80, P=0.004). At sensitivity 80%, the specificity of the MoCA-MIS was 69.1%, compared with 62.8% for the Craft Story.CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the MoCA-MIS, a recall score from items within the MoCA, is better at discriminating NCs from subjects with aMCI than the Craft Story. Word recall may be an efficient alternative to paragraph recall for diagnostic screening within clinical practice and research settings."

"29315714","Brain abnormalities in cognition, anxiety, and depression regulatory regions in adolescents with single ventricle heart disease.","BACKGROUND: Single ventricle heart disease (SVHD) adolescents show cognitive impairments and anxiety and depressive symptoms, indicating the possibility of brain injury in regions that control these functions. However, brain tissue integrity in cognition, anxiety, and depression regulatory sites in SVHD remains unclear. We examined brain tissue changes in SVHD compared to controls using T2-relaxometry procedures, which measure free water content and show tissue injury.METHODS: Proton-density and T2-weighted images, using a 3.0-Tesla MRI, as well as anxiety (Beck anxiety inventory [BAI]), depressive symptoms (patient health questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]), and cognition (wide range assessment of memory and learning 2 [WRAML2] and Montreal cognitive assessment [MoCA]) data were collected from 20 SVHD (age: 15.8<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.1 years, male/female: 11/9) and 36 controls (age: 16.0<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.1 years, male/female: 19/17). Whole-brain T2-relaxation maps were calculated, normalized to a common space, smoothed, and compared between groups and sexes (analysis of covariance; covariates: age, sex; p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001).RESULTS: SVHD subjects showed significantly increased BAI and PHQ-9 and reduced MoCA and WRAML2 scores over controls. Several brain regions in SVHD showed increased T2-relaxation values (chronic injury), including the cingulate, and insula, hippocampus/para-hippocampal gyrus, thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, frontal white matter, corpus callosum, brainstem, and cerebellar areas. Decreased T2-relaxation values (acute injury) emerged in a few regions, including the prefrontal and cerebellar cortices in SVHD over controls. In addition, male SVHD showed more brain changes over female SVHD.CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents with SVHD showed significant brain injury with variable male-female differences in areas that control cognition, anxiety, and depression, which may contribute to functional deficits found in the condition."
"29304951","Left atrial appendage angiography is associated with the incidence and number of magnetic resonance imaging-detected brain lesions after percutaneous catheter-based left atrial appendage closure.","BACKGROUND: Percutaneous catheter-based left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) is a procedure being increasingly performed in patients with atrial fibrillation and high bleeding risk.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-detected acute brain lesions (ABLs) as well as potential changes in neurocognitive function after percutaneous LAAC in patients with atrial fibrillation.METHODS: Brain MRI at 3 T was performed within 24 hours before and after LAAC along with neurologic (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score) and cognitive (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] test) assessment. Acquired MRI sequences included high-resolution diffusion-weighted imaging as well as fluid-attenuated inversion recovery.RESULTS: Successful device implantation was achieved in all 23 patients (age 74.1 ± 10.5 years; 16 male) using the Amulet (n = 18), Occlutech (n = 3), or LAmbre (n = 2) device. Thirty-seven ABLs were detected by MRI in 12 of 23 patients (52%) after LAAC. The number of periprocedural LAA angiographies was significantly higher in patients with ABL than in those without ABL (1.67 ± 0.65 vs 1.18 ± 0.41; P = .048) and was associated with a higher number of ABL (<U+03C1> = 0.615; P = .033). Compared to pre-LAAC assessment, post-LAAC MoCA and NIHSS scores revealed similar results. After LAAC, MoCA test (mean 24.1 ± 4.6 vs 23.2 ± 4.6; P = .09) and NIHSS score (mean 1.0 ± 1.7 vs 1.2 ± 1.8; P = .1) were similar between patients with and those without ABL, respectively.CONCLUSION: MRI-detected ABLs are commonly observed after percutaneous LAAC. The number of LAA angiographies is significantly associated with the number of ABLs; however, the clinical implications of ABL have yet to be determined."

"29300426","Physical Frailty Is Associated with Longitudinal Decline in Global Cognitive Function in Non-Demented Older Adults: A Prospective Study.","OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between physical frailty and subsequent decline in global cognitive function in the non-demented elderly.DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective population-based study in a west Japanese suburban town, with two-year follow-up.PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwellers aged 65 and older without placement in long-term care, and not having a history of dementia, Parkinson's disease and depression at baseline, who participated in the cohort of the Sasaguri Genkimon Study and underwent follow-up assessments two years later (N = 1,045).MEASUREMENTS: Global cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Physical frailty was identified according to the following five components: weight loss, low grip strength, exhaustion, slow gait speed and low physical activities. Linear regression models were used to examine associations between baseline frailty status and the MoCA scores at follow-up. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the risk of cognitive decline (defined as at least two points decrease of MoCA score) according to baseline frailty status.RESULTS: Seven hundred and eight non-demented older adults were included in the final analyses (mean age: 72.6 ± 5.5 years, male 40.3%); 5.8% were frail, and 40.8% were prefrail at baseline. One hundred and fifty nine (22.5%) participants experienced cognitive decline over two years. After adjustment for baseline MoCA scores and all confounders, being frail at baseline was significantly associated with a decline of 1.48 points (95% confidence interval [CI], -2.37 to -0.59) in MoCA scores, as compared with non-frailty. Frail persons were over two times more likely to experience cognitive decline (adjusted odds ratio 2.28; 95% CI, 1.02 to 5.08), compared to non-frail persons.CONCLUSION: Physical frailty is associated with longitudinal decline in global cognitive function in the non-demented older adults over a period of two years. Physically frail older community-dwellers should be closely monitored for cognitive decline that can be sensitively captured by using the MoCA."
"29292529","Converting MMSE to MoCA and MoCA 5-minute protocol in an educationally heterogeneous sample with stroke or transient ischemic attack.","BACKGROUND: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is psychometrically superior over the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) for cognitive screening in stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). It is free for clinical and research use. The objective of this study is to convert scores from the MMSE to MoCA and MoCA-5-minute protocol (MoCA-5 min) and to examine the ability of the converted scores in detecting cognitive impairment after stroke or TIA.METHODS: A total of 904 patients were randomly divided into training (n = 623) and validation (n = 281) samples matched for demography and cognition. MMSE scores were converted to MoCA and MoCA-5 min using (1) equipercentile method with log-linear smoothing and (2) Poisson regression adjusting for age and education. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was used to examine the ability of the converted scores in differentiating patients with cognitive impairment.RESULTS: The mean education was 5.8 (SD = 4.6; ranged 0-20) years. The entire spectrum of MMSE scores was converted to MoCA and MoCA-5 min using equipercentile method. Relationship between MMSE and MoCA scores was confounded by age and education, and a conversion equation with adjustment for age and education was derived. In the validation sample, the converted scores differentiated cognitively impaired patients with area under receiver operating characteristics curve 0.826 to 0.859.CONCLUSION: We provided 2 methods to convert scores from the MMSE to MoCA and MoCA-5 min based on a large sample of patients with stroke or TIA having a wide range of education and cognitive levels. The converted scores differentiated patients with cognitive impairment after stroke or TIA with high accuracy."
