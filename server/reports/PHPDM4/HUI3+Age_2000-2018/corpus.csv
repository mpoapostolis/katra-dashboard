"11360148","The health status of obese individuals in Canada.","OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is a clinically relevant difference in the health state utilities of obese and non-obese individuals as measured by the Health Utility Index Mark III.METHODS: Secondary analysis of the population-based, cross-sectional, interviewer-administered National Population Health Survey (NPHS), 1996-1997. A probability sample of house-dwelling Canadians, excluding populations on First Nations Reserves, Canadian Armed Forces Bases, the Yukon and Northwest Territories, and long-term residents of hospitals or residential care facilities. The sub-sample used in this analysis consisted of 38 151 respondents (52.4% male) between the ages of 20 and 64 y, excluding pregnant women. Health Utilities Index-Mark III (HUI3) scores were used to define normal weight (body mass index (BMI) 19-24.9 kg/m(2)), overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m(2)), obese (BMI 30-34.9 kg/m(2)), and morbidly obese (BMI&gt; or =35 kg/m(2)) individuals. HUI3 scores were age- and gender-standardized.RESULTS: The overall prevalence of obesity (BMI&gt; or =30 kg/m(2)) in this Canadian population was 13.3%. The average difference in HUI3 scores between normal weight and morbidly obese respondents was 0.04 (P&lt;0.001). Statistically significant (P&lt;0.05) differences across BMI categories were found in each of the eight component attributes of the HUI3. The attributes with the most substantial difference between normal and obese patients were cognition, mobility and pain. All demonstrated a &gt; or =2-fold increase in the proportion of individuals in poorer classifications of health when normal weight respondents were compared with the morbidly obese. The magnitude of the decrement in utility ratings associated with obesity was comparable with other chronic non-cardiovascular conditions such as migraine or colitis.CONCLUSION: The results indicate that changes in self-rated health status appear to be due to significant changes across several relevant domain attributes. Obesity has a significant impact on both quality of life and health."
"12410568","Health status and health-related quality of life associated with hemophilia.","The hemophilias are a group of disorders associated with a chronic burden of morbidity and early mortality. Improvements in these adverse features have been achieved by the use of clotting factor concentrates within comprehensive centers of specialized care providing home infusion programs. Offsetting effects from transfusion-transmitted hepatitis and HIV infection are in recent decline. The net impact of these changes merits assessment. To test the a priori hypotheses that increasing severity of factor VIII deficiency would be associated with an increasing burden or morbidity and that hepatitis and HIV positivity would impair health status further, a cross-sectional study of a population-based cohort was undertaken in a regional hemophilia program in Ontario, Canada. A survey was made of mild, moderate, and severe hemophiliacs over 13 years of age who self-reported their health status using a standard 15-item questionnaire. The responses were converted to levels in the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI2) and Mark 3 (HUI3) health status classification systems to form multi-element vectors from which single-attribute morbidity and overall health-related quality of life utility scores were determined. The burden of morbidity was greater in hemophiliacs than in the general population and correlated with the category of disease (mild &lt; moderate &lt; severe). Hepatitis and HIV positivity conferred additional burdens of morbidity, which were mainly in the attributes of mobility (HUI2), ambulation (HUI3), and pain (HUI2/3), all of these differences reaching levels of statistical significance. Despite demonstrable improvements in the safety, effectiveness, and utilization of clotting factor concentrates, hemophiliacs continue to experience an important burden of morbidity. Measurement of this burden, as reported here, provides a basis for future economic evaluation of the costs and consequences of health care interventions provided to this population."
"11802084","Multiattribute and single-attribute utility functions for the health utilities index mark 3 system.","BACKGROUND: The Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) is a generic multiattribute preference-based measure of health status and health-related quality of life that is widely used as an outcome measure in clinical studies, in population health surveys, in the estimation of quality-adjusted life years, and in economic evaluations. HUI3 consists of eight attributes (or dimensions) of health status: vision, hearing, speech, ambulation, dexterity, emotion, cognition, and pain with 5 or 6 levels per attribute, varying from highly impaired to normal.OBJECTIVES: The objectives are to present a multiattribute utility function and eight single-attribute utility functions for the HUI3 system based on community preferences.STUDY DESIGN: Two preference surveys were conducted. One, the modeling survey, collected preference scores for the estimation of the utility functions. The other, the direct survey, provided independent scores to assess the predictive validity of the utility functions.MEASURES: Preference measures included value scores obtained on the Feeling Thermometer and standard gamble utility scores obtained using the Chance Board.RESPONDENTS: A random sample of the general population (&gt; or =16 years of age) in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.RESULTS: Estimates were obtained for eight single-attribute utility functions and an overall multiattribute utility function. The intraclass correlation coefficient between directly measured utility scores and scores generated by the multiattribute function for 73 health states was 0.88.CONCLUSIONS: The HUI3 scoring function has strong theoretical and empirical foundations. It performs well in predicting directly measured scores. The HUI3 system provides a practical way to obtain utility scores based on community preferences."
"14672109","A comparison of the health utilities indices Mark 2 and Mark 3 in type 2 diabetes.","PURPOSE: Past research into health-related quality of life (HRQL) in diabetes using preference-based measures, such as the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI2) or the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3), is sparse. Important differences between the HUI2 and HUI3 could lead to differences in their abilities to capture HRQL deficits in type 2 diabetes. This analysis compared the extent to which the HUI2 and HUI3 detect differences associated with varying levels of disease severity or advancement in type 2 diabetes. METHODS. This analysis was conducted as part of using baseline, cross-sectional data from a larger, prospective, controlled study of an intervention to improve care for individuals with type 2 diabetes in rural communities in Alberta, Canada. The HU12 and HUI3 were self-administered to 372 community-dwelling individuals with type 2 diabetes.RESULTS: Relative to HUI2 scores, larger differences in overall HUI3 scores were seen for comparisons for individuals presumed to have more advanced disease. The pain attribute of the HUI3 categorized a larger proportion of individuals as moderately to severely impaired (41.5% v. 24.2%, P &lt; 0.001), as did the emotion attribute (20.5% v. 7.7%, P &lt; 0.001). For individuals with negative overall HUI3 scores, differences between overall HUI2 and HUI3 scores persisted after rescaling (mean difference = 0.33, P = 0.009).CONCLUSIONS: The greater range of possible scores on the HUI3, its relative ability to assess the utility of states worse than dead, and its relative superiority in discriminating moderate to severe impairment from mild or no impairment might favor its use over the HUI2 in type 2 diabetes."
"14614995","Is the Health Utilities Index responsive in total hip arthroplasty patients?","OBJECTIVE: The purpose is to examine the responsiveness of the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI2), Mark 3 (HUI3), and other generic and disease-specific measures in osteoarthritis patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA).METHODS: Ninety patients (mean age=68.13; SD=8.15) on a waiting list for THA completed measures that included the standard gamble, HUI2, HUI3, SF-36, Harris Hip Scale, WOMAC, and MACTAR. before and after THA. Responsiveness statistics (effect size, standardized response mean, Guyatt's responsiveness statistic, paired-sample t-tests, and relative efficiency statistic) were calculated.RESULTS: The disease-specific measures were more responsive than the generic measures. Rankings of the degree of responsiveness varied depending on the responsiveness statistic used.CONCLUSIONS: Disease-specific measures are the most responsive in THA patients. However, the SF-36, HUI2, and HUI3 had summary scores and domain/attributes scores that were also responsive and provided additional information. Among the generic measures, HUI3 was the most responsive."
"14530198","Health-related quality of life is better for cardiac arrest survivors who received citizen cardiopulmonary resuscitation.","BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the prehospital factors associated with better health-related quality of life for survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective, 20-community, cohort study involved consecutive, adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients who survived to 1 year. Patients were contacted by telephone and evaluated for the Health Utilities Index Mark III (HUI3), which describes health as a utility score on a scale from 0 (dead) to 1.0 (perfect health). The 8091 cardiac arrest patients had overall survival rates of 5.2% to hospital discharge and 4.0% to 1 year. We successfully contacted and evaluated 268 of 316 (84.8%) of known 1-year survivors. The median HUI3 score was 0.80 (interquartile range, 0.50 to 0.97), which compares well with age-adjusted values for the general population (0.83). Logistic regression identified 2 factors independently associated with very good quality of life (HUI3 &gt;0.90) and their odds ratios (95% CIs), as follows: age 80 years or older, 0.3 (0.1 to 0.84), and citizen-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), 2.0 (1.2 to 3.4) (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic, 0.74).CONCLUSIONS: This study is the largest ever conducted for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors, clearly shows that these patients have good quality of life, and is the first to demonstrate that citizen-initiated CPR is strongly and independently associated with better quality of life. These results emphasize the importance of optimizing community citizen CPR readiness. Given the low rate of citizen-initiated CPR in many communities, we believe that local and national initiatives should vigorously promote the practice of bystander CPR."
"12749012","Health status and health-related quality of life associated with von Willebrand disease.","Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the commonest inherited disorder of hemostasis and the majority of women with this disorder experience excessive uterine bleeding. Yet very little information is available on the health-related quality of life (HRQL) in individuals with VWD. To test the a priori hypotheses that these individuals will have poorer HRQL than members of the general population, and that this burden of morbidity will correlate with the severity of VWD, a cross-sectional study was undertaken of a population-based cohort in a regional hemophilia program in Ontario, Canada. A survey was made of individuals over 13 years of age with VWD who self-reported their health status using a standard 15 item questionnaire. The responses were converted to levels in the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI2) and Mark 3 (HUI3) health status classification systems to form multi-element vectors from which single attribute morbidity and overall HRQL utility scores were determined. As a group, individuals with VWD were shown to have poorer HRQL than members of the general population and those with Type 2 disease carried a greater burden of overall morbidity than those with Type 1 disorder. Morbidity was evident mainly in the attributes of emotion, cognition with pain. A striking difference was observed between males and females, with the latter having overall HRQL utility scores similar to those reported previously for HIV positive, severe hemophiliacs. It is possible that this remarkable burden of morbidity reflects chronic iron deficiency associated with menorrhagia. A national study has been proposed to address this likelihood as it offers an opportunity for effective therapeutic intervention (iron supplementation) with a concomitant gain in health status and HRQL."
"12625514","Adjusting distributions of the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 utility scores of health-related quality of life.","The Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) is a multi-dimensional, preference-based measure of health status and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). HUI3 scores correlate strongly with self-ratings of health status and functional disability and vary according to age, gender and occupation. In comparative studies relating to HRQoL, it is necessary to carry out adjusted comparison of the health status of the different groups. taking into account unbalanced distribution of confounding variables. This paper describes a stratification method to adjust the distributions of HUI3 scores. This method provides a graphical representation of adjusted distribution of HUI3, which can also be used to adjust other HRQoL scores. Cross-sectional data from the 1998/1999 National Population Health Survey (NPHS) in Canada were used to verify the proposed method. Male agriculture workers and male construction workers in Canada had quite different age distributions but similar HUI3 distributions. After adjusting the age distribution of the construction group to match the distribution of agriculture group, the mean HUI3 score of the former significantly decreased."
"15556237","Cut-point shift and index shift in self-reported health.","There is some concern that ordered responses on health questions may differ across populations or even across subgroups of a population. This reporting heterogeneity may invalidate group comparisons and measures of health inequality. This paper proposes a test for differential reporting in ordered response models which enables to distinguish between cut-point shift and index shift. The method is illustrated using Canadian National Population Health Survey data. The McMaster Health Utility Index Mark 3 (HUI3) is used as a more objective health measure than the simple five-point scale of self-assessed health. We find clear evidence of index shifting and cut-point shifting for age and gender, but not for income, education or language."
"15319619","Mapping the SF-12 to the HUI3 and VAS in a managed care population.","BACKGROUND: Transforming generic health-related quality of life (HRQOL) instruments to a summary utility index is useful for deriving quality-adjusted life years (QALY) in any cost/QALY analysis.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the SF-12 in predicting utility scores derived from Health Utility Index (HUI3) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS).METHOD: Data were obtained from a survey of 6923 managed care patients in the United States, aged 18 to 93 years, selected by strata of medication usage (at least 1 medication in target year, 5 or more medications, target medications, and both). The SF-12 was used to assess self-reported HRQOL. Utility was measured by the HUI3 and a VAS. The SF-12 items were used to predict HUI3 and VAS scores using ordinary least square regressions, with sociodemographic covariates. A second model entered each SF-12 item as categorized responses. A third model used the Physical Composite and Mental Composite scores to predict HUI3 and VAS scores.RESULTS: The SF-12 items and sociodemographic covariates accounted for 35% to 55% of the variations in HUI3 and VAS scores, respectively. Age and most SF-12 items were significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) associated with both utility scores in all 3 models.CONCLUSIONS: This research provides support that an algorithm can be derived from the SF-12 to estimate utility scores based on the HUI3 and VAS for studies in populations where utility has not or cannot be measured directly."
"16330290","Triple therapy with glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled by metformin and a thiazolidinedione: results of a 30-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.","OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus that was inadequately controlled with a combination of immediate- or extended-release metformin and a thiazolidinedione.METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 2-arm study consisting of a 4-week stabilization and eligibility period and a 26-week treatment period. Patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes for a minimum of 1 year received glimepiride (titrated sequentially from 2 to 4 to 8 mg/d over 6 weeks, followed by 20 weeks of maintenance therapy) or placebo in combination with an established regimen of immediate- or extended release metformin and rosiglitazone or pioglitazone. The primary efficacy outcome was the change in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) from baseline. The safety analysis was based on the incidence of hypo glycemia, adverse events, and laboratory abnormalities. Changes in lipid levels (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides) were evaluated, and health-related quality of life was assessed based on scores on the Diabetes Care Profile (DCP) and Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HU13).RESULTS: Of 170 randomized patients, 159 were included in the efficacy analysis and 168 were included in the safety analysis. Demographic variables were similar at baseline between the glimepiride and placebo groups (mean age, 56.5 and 56.4 years, respectively; percent men/women, 61.0%/39.0% and 62.3%/37.7%; weight, 100.9 and 96.3 kg). HbA(1c) was significantly improved at end point with glimepiride combination therapy compared with placebo (mean [SE], -1.31% [0.08] vs -0.33% [0.08], respectively; P &lt; 0.001). The majority of patients (62.2%) who received glimepiride achieved an HbA(1c) value of &lt; or =7%, compared with 26.0% of patients receiving placebo (P &lt; 0.001 between groups). At end point, the adjusted mean differences between treatments significantly favored the glimepiride combination in terms of fasting plasma glucose (-37.4 [4.0] mg/dL; P &lt; 0.001), fasting insulin (4.06 [1.69] microIU/mL; P &lt; 0.03), and C-peptide (124.5 [35.9] pmol/L; P &lt; 0.001). The adjusted mean changes in body mass index from baseline to end point were 1.26 (0.16) kg/m(2) with glimepiride and 0.17 (0.16) kg/m(2) with placebo (P &lt; 0.001). Similarly, the mean change in weight was greater with glimepiride than with placebo (3.76 [0.54] vs 0.45 [0.52] kg; P &lt; 0.001). There were no significant differences in lipid levels between groups. Clinically significant adverse events, laboratory abnormalities, and rates of severe hypoglycemia were similar between treatment groups. The overall incidence of hypoglycemia, however, was 51.2% in the glimepiride group and 8.3% in the placebo group (P &lt; 0.001). In general, there was no significant difference between treatment groups with respect to scores on the DCP or HUI3 over the study period.CONCLUSIONS: In these patients with type 2 diabetes that was not adequately controlled by dual combination therapy with metformin and a thiazolidinedione, the addition of glimepiride improved glycemic control compared with placebo with an acceptable tolerability profile. Although there were significantly more episodes of hypoglycemia with triple therapy than with dual therapy and placebo, the risk for severe hypoglycemia was low."
"16249475","The impact of age-related macular degeneration on health status utility values.","PURPOSE: To estimate health status utility values in patients with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) associated with visual impairments, by using preference-based measures of health.METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study involving patients with unilateral or bilateral ARMD who attended a large teaching hospital. Patients underwent visual tests (near and distant visual acuity [VA] and contrast sensitivity [CS]) and completed health status questionnaires including the Index of Visual Function (VF)-14 and three preference-based measures (the Health Utilities Index Mark III [HUI-3], the EuroQoL Health Questionnaire [EQ-5D], and the Short Form 6D Health Status Questionnaire [SF-6D]) and the time tradeoff (TTO). The mean health status is presented for five groups, defined according to the VA in the better-seeing eye and for four CS groups.RESULTS: Two hundred nine patients were recruited with substantial loss of visual function as obtained by visual tests (mean decimal VA in the better-seeing eye: 0.2) and self-report (mean VF-14 score: 41.5). The mean (+/-SD) utilities were 0.34 +/- 0.28 for HUI-3, 0.66 +/- 0.14 for SF-6D, 0.72 +/- 0.22 for EQ-5D, and 0.64 +/- 0.31 for TTO. The HUI-3 had the highest correlation with VA and CS (0.40 and -0.34), followed by TTO (0.25 and -0.21). Across the VA and CS groups, only HUI3 and TTO had a significant linear trend (P &lt; 0.05). In a regression model with CS and VA as explanatory variables, only the coefficient on CS was statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: ARMD is associated with a substantial impact on patients' health status, but this was not reflected in two of the generic preference-based measures used. The HUI-3 seems to be the instrument of choice for use in economic evaluations in which community data are needed. It may be more appropriate to base economic models on CS or some combination of CS and VA rather than on VA alone."
"16224300","Self-reported health status of the general adult U.S. population as assessed by the EQ-5D and Health Utilities Index.","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the self-reported health status of the general adult U.S. population using 3 multi-attribute preference-based measures: the EQ-5D, Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI2), and Mark 3 (HUI3).METHODS: We surveyed the general adult U.S. population using a probability sample with oversampling of Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks. Respondents to this home-visit survey self-completed the EQ-5D and HUI2/3 questionnaires. Overall health index scores of the target population and selected subgroups were estimated and construct validity of these measures was assessed by testing a priori hypotheses.RESULTS: Completed questionnaires were collected from 4048 respondents (response rate: 59.4%). The majority of the respondents were women (52.0%); the mean age of the sample was 45 years, with 14.8% being 65 or older. Index scores (standard errors) for the general adult U.S. population as assessed by the EQ-5D, HUI2, and HUI3 were 0.87 (0.01), 0.86 (0.01), and 0.81 (0.01), respectively. Generally, younger, male and Hispanic or non-Hispanic black adults had higher (better) index scores than older, female and other racial/ethnic adults; index scores were higher with higher educational attainment and household income. The 3 overall preference indices were strongly correlated (Pearson's r: 0.67-0.87), but systematically different, with intraclass correlation coefficients between these indices ranging from 0.59 to 0.77.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides U.S. population norms for self-reported health status on the EQ-5D, HUI2, and HUI3. Although these measures appeared to be valid and demonstrated similarities, health status assessed by these measures is not exactly the same."
"16133651","Health-related quality of life measurements in elderly Canadians with osteoporosis compared to other chronic medical conditions: a population-based study from the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMos).","The objective of this research was to determine the relative decrement in health-related quality of life, as measured by the health utilities index mark 3 (HUI3), in osteoporosis compared to other chronic medical conditions. The impact of chronic medical conditions other than osteoporosis on HUI3 measurements had been previously established in the 1996/1997 Canadian National Population Health Survey (NPHS). The Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMos) is a national population-based study in which regional participants were randomly recruited, regardless of presence of osteoporosis. We analyzed data from participants aged &gt; or = 65 years who completed a baseline HUI3 questionnaire and provided information on their medical history (n=3,750). We determined the age- and gender-adjusted mean decrement in HUI3 for several chronic medical conditions, including osteoporosis. The mean changes in HUI3 adjusted for age and gender (with 95% confidence intervals) were as follows: arthritis -0.10 (-0.11, -0.09), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) -0.07 (-0.09, -0.05), diabetes mellitus -0.05 (-0.08, -0.03), heart disease -0.06 (-0.08, -0.04), hypertension -0.02 (-0.03, -0.01), and osteoporosis -0.08 (-0.11, -0.06), respectively (model r2=0.17; P&lt;0.0001). These findings were comparable to those observed in the NPHS, with the exception of osteoporosis, which had not been previously studied in this fashion. The decrement in HUI3 score seen in participants with osteoporosis was comparable to that observed in other chronic medical conditions, such as arthritis, COPD, diabetes mellitus or heart disease."
"15916116","A comparison of the quality of life of hearing-impaired people as estimated by three different utility measures.","The purpose of this study was to compare the quality of life of hearing-impaired adults, as assessed by three different utility measures - the EuroQol (EQ-5D), the Health Utilities Index Mark III (HUI3), and the SF-6D (derived from the SF-36 questionnaire). Measuring quality of life in terms of utility enables the benefits of many interventions to be compared on a common scale, where 0 corresponds to death and 1 to perfect health. Utility scores for 915 new referrals (mean age 69 years, 55% male) to four UK audiology clinics were estimated. The mean utility scores on the EQ-5D (0.79), SF-6D (0.77), and HUI3 (0.56) were all significantly different from each other The agreement between measures was most commonly moderate according to the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC =0.36 to 0.58). This suggests that different utility measures will provide different estimates of the effectiveness of hearing aid provision."
"17119846","Determinants of health related quality of life and health state utility in patients with age related macular degeneration: the association of contrast sensitivity and visual acuity.","BACKGROUND: There has been increasing interest in the use of measures of health related quality of life (HRQoL) and health state utility values in Age Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD). Visual acuity has been found to be an important determinant of such measures in previous studies. More recently, another measure of visual impairment, contrast sensitivity has received considerable attention. We designed a study to examine whether the contribution of contrast sensitivity in explaining HRQoL and health utilities over and above that of visual acuity.METHODS: 209 patients with unilateral or bilateral ARMD were recruited into a cross-sectional study of patients from a large teaching hospital. Patients underwent visual tests (near and distant visual acuity, contrast sensitivity) and completed a vision function questionnaire, the VF-14, HUI3, and time trade-off.RESULTS: Using multivariate regression analysis, the study revealed that contrast sensitivity remained a statistically significant predictor of all outcome measures even when visual acuity was included. This result was supported by the correlation coefficients between measures.CONCLUSIONS: The measurement of contrast sensitivity appears to be better related to a person's HRQoL and health utility. Future studies should consider incorporating contrast sensitivity in addition to visual acuity. Studies, in particular economic evaluations, may underestimate the effect of treatment unless contrast sensitivity is considered."
"17076901","Deriving utility scores for co-morbid conditions: a test of the multiplicative model for combining individual condition scores.","BACKGROUND: The co-morbidity of health conditions is becoming a significant health issue, particularly as populations age, and presents important methodological challenges for population health research. For example, the calculation of summary measures of population health (SMPH) can be compromised if co-morbidity is not taken into account. One popular co-morbidity adjustment used in SMPH computations relies on a straightforward multiplicative combination of the severity weights for the individual conditions involved. While the convenience and simplicity of the multiplicative model are attractive, its appropriateness has yet to be formally tested. The primary objective of the current study was therefore to examine the empirical evidence in support of this approach.METHODS: The present study drew on information on the prevalence of chronic conditions and a utility-based measure of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), namely the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3), available from Cycle 1.1 of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS; 2000-01). Average HUI3 scores were computed for both single and co-morbid conditions, and were also purified by statistically removing the loss of functional health due to health problems other than the chronic conditions reported. The co-morbidity rule was specified as a multiplicative combination of the purified average observed HUI3 utility scores for the individual conditions involved, with the addition of a synergy coefficient s for capturing any interaction between the conditions not explained by the product of their utilities. The fit of the model to the purified average observed utilities for the co-morbid conditions was optimized using ordinary least squares regression to estimate s. Replicability of the results was assessed by applying the method to triple co-morbidities from the CCHS cycle 1.1 database, as well as to double and triple co-morbidities from cycle 2.1 of the CCHS (2003-04).RESULTS: Model fit was optimized at s = .99 (i.e., essentially a straightforward multiplicative model). These results were closely replicated with triple co-morbidities reported on CCHS 2000-01, as well as with double and triple co-morbidities reported on CCHS 2003-04.CONCLUSION: The findings support the simple multiplicative model for computing utilities for co-morbid conditions from the utilities for the individual conditions involved. Future work using a wider variety of conditions and data sources could serve to further evaluate and refine the approach."
"17063129","Is cataract surgery cost-effective among older patients with a low predicted probability for improvement in reported visual functioning?","INTRODUCTION: Although cataract surgery has been demonstrated to be effective and cost-effective, 5% to 20% of patients do not benefit functionally from the procedure. This study examines the cost-effectiveness of cataract surgery versus watchful waiting in a subgroup of patients who had less than a 30% predicted probability of reporting improvements in visual function after surgery.METHODS: Randomized trial (first eye surgery vs. watchful waiting) of 250 patients who based on a cataract surgery index (CSI) were felt to have less than a 30% probability of reporting improvements in visual functioning after surgery. Cost was estimated using monthly resource utilization surveys and Medicare billing and payment data. Effectiveness was evaluated at 6 months using the Activities of Daily Vision Scale (ADVS) and the Health Utilities Index, Mark 3 (HUI3).RESULTS: In terms of overall utility, the incremental cost-effectiveness of surgery was Dollars 38,288/QALY. In the subgroup of patients with a CSI score &gt; 11 (&lt; 20% probability of improvement), the cost-effectiveness of cataract surgery was Dollars 53,500/QALY. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that often this population of patients may not derive a utility benefit with surgery.CONCLUSION: Cataract surgery is cost-effective even in a subpopulation of patient with a lower, &lt; 30%, predicted probability of reporting improved visual functioning after surgery. There may be a subgroup of patients, CSI &gt; 11, for whom a strategy of watchful waiting may be equally effective and considerably less expensive."
"16721648","A study of the construct validity of the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) in patients with schizophrenia.","This study assessed the construct validity of the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) in patients with schizophrenia. Patients with schizophrenia recruited from a tertiary mental hospital in Singapore completed the HUI3, the Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) and the Schizophrenia Quality of Life Scale (SQLS). Patients were assessed for presence and absence of 22 common psychiatric symptoms. Construct validity was assessed using 6 a priori hypotheses. Two hundred and two patients (mean age: 37.8 years, female: 52%) completed the survey. As hypothesized, overall HUI3 utility scores were correlated with SF-36 measures (Spearman's rho: 0.19 to 0.51), SQLS scales (Spearman's rho: -0.56 to -0.36), and the number of psychiatric symptoms (Spearman's rho: -0.49). The HUI3 emotion attribute was moderately correlated with SF-36 mental health (Spearman's rho: 0.45) and SQLS psychosocial scales (Spearman's rho: -0.43), and HUI3 pain attribute was strongly correlated with SF-36 bodily pain scale (Spearman's rho: 0.58). The mean HUI3 overall, emotion, cognition, and speech scores for patients with schizophrenia were 0.07, 0.09, 0.04 and 0.04 points lower than respective age-, sex- and ethnicity-adjusted population norms (p&lt;0.001 for all, ANCOVA).

Profile measures often use a norm-based scoring algorithm where each scale is scored to have a standardized mean and standard deviation, relative to the general population scores/norms (i.e., norm-based). Preference-based index measures generate an overall scores on the conventional scale in which 0.00 is assigned to dead and 1.00 is assigned to perfect health. Our objective was to investigate the interpretation of norm-based scoring of generic health status measures in a population of adults with type 1 diabetes by comparing norm-based health status scores and preference-based health-related quality of life (HRQL) scores.METHODS: Data were collected through self-complete questionnaires sent to patients with type 1 diabetes. The RAND-36 and the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) were included.RESULTS: A total of 216 (61%) questionnaires were returned. The respondent sample was predominantly female (58.8%); had a mean (SD) age of 37.1 (14.3) years and a mean duration of diabetes of 20.9 (12.4) years. Mean (SD) health status scores were: RAND-36 PHC 47.9 (9.4), RAND-36 MHC 47.2 (11.8), and HUI3 0.78 (0.23). Histograms of these scores show substantial left skew. HUI3 scores were similar to those previously reported for diabetes in the general Canadian population. Physical and mental health summary scores of the RAND-36 suggest that this population is as healthy as the general adult population.CONCLUSION: In this sample, a preference-based measure indicated poorer health, consistent with clinical evidence, whereas a norm-based measure indicated health similar to the average for the general population. Norm-based scoring measure may provide misleading interpretations in populations when health status is not normally distributed."
"18093310","Physical activity as a mediator of the impact of chronic conditions on quality of life in older adults.","BACKGROUND: Chronic conditions could negatively affect the quality of life of older adults. This may be partially due to a relative lack of physical activity. We examined whether physical activity mediates the relationship between different chronic conditions and several health outcomes that are important to the quality of life of older adults.METHODS: The data were taken from the Canadian Community Health Survey (cycle 1.1), a cross-section survey completed in 2001. Only respondents who were 65 years or older were included in our study (N = 22,432). The Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) was used to measure overall quality of life, and to measure selected health outcomes (dexterity, mobility, pain, cognition, and emotional wellbeing) that are considered to be of importance to the quality of life of older adults. Leisure-time physical activity was assessed by determining weekly energy expenditure (Kcal per week) based on the metabolic equivalents of self-reported leisure activities. Linear and logistic regression models were used to determine the mediating effect of leisure-time physical activity while controlling for demographic variables (age and sex), substance use (tobacco use and alcohol consumption), and obesity.RESULTS: Having a chronic condition was associated with a relative decrease in health utility scores and a relative increase in mobility limitations, dexterity problems, pain, emotional problems (i.e., decreased happiness), and cognitive limitations. These negative consequences could be partially attributed to a relative lack of physical activity in older adults with a chronic condition (14% mediation for the HUI3 score). The corresponding degree of mediation was 18% for mobility limitations, 5% for pain, and 13% for emotional wellbeing (statistically significant mediation was not observed for the other health attributes). These values varied with respect to the different chronic conditions examined in our study.CONCLUSION: Older adults with chronic conditions are less likely to engage in leisure-time physical activities of at least 1,000 Kcal per week, and this association partially accounts for some negative consequences of chronic conditions, including mobility limitations, pain, and emotional problems. These findings provide support for health promotion programs that facilitate or encourage increased leisure-time physical activity in older people with chronic conditions."
"17939874","Comparing the health of low income and less well educated groups in the United States and Canada.","BACKGROUND: A limited number of health status and health-related quality of life (HRQL) measures have been used for inter-country comparisons of population health. We compared the health of Canadians and Americans using a preference-based measure.METHODS: The Joint Canada/United States Survey of Health (JCUSH) 2002-03 conducted a comprehensive cross-sectional telephone survey on the health of community-dwelling residents in Canada and the US (n = 8688). A preference-based measure, the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3), was included in the JCUSH. Health status was analyzed for the entire population and white population only in both countries. Mean HUI3 overall scores were compared for both countries. A linear regression determinants of health model was estimated to account for differences in health between Canada and the US. Estimation with bootstraps was used to derive variance estimates that account for the survey's complex sampling design of clustering and stratification.RESULTS: Income is associated with health in both countries. In the lowest income quintile, Canadians are healthier than Americans. At lower levels of education, again Canadians are healthier than Americans. Differences in health among subjects in the JCUSH are explained by age, gender, education, income, marital status, and country of residence.CONCLUSION: On average, population health in Canada and the US is similar. However, health disparities between Canadians and Americans exist at lower levels of education and income with Americans worse off. The results highlight the usefulness of continuous preference-based measures of population health such as the HUI3."
"17888214","Computerized administration of health-related quality of life instruments compared to interviewer administration may reduce sample size requirements in clinical research: a pilot randomized controlled trial among rheumatology patients.","OBJECTIVES: Computerized health-related quality of life (HRQoL) administration may facilitate clinical trials incorporating HRQoL assessment in rheumatology patients by reducing sample size requirements. We tested this hypothesis in a pilot randomized controlled trial.METHODS: Chinese-speaking adult rheumatology outpatients were randomized to computerized (PC) or interviewer (IA) administration of the EQ-5D (utility &amp; VAS), Health Utilities Index (HUI2 &amp; HUI3) and Family Functioning Measure (FFM). We compared measurement variability (i.e., variance) between PC and IA for each instrument before (Levene's test) and after adjusting for the effects of age, gender and education (multivariable modeling) and computed the variance ratio (VR) for PC over IA.RESULTS: In 138 patients (mean age: 48), the mean (SD) time for administration was similar for PC (n = 67) and IA (n = 71) at 17.7 (7.94) versus 17.3 minutes (7.49), respectively. More subjects expressed a preference for PC (n = 21) over IA (n = 13). Mean HRQoL scores were not significantly different for PC versus IA except for higher VAS scores with IA (difference -7.7, 95% CI -14.0 to 1.3, p = 0.018). Variances and adjusted VR were smaller with PC for the EQ-5D (adjusted VR 0.34, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.65), HUI3 (0.49, 0.27 to 0.89) and FFM (0.95, 0.61 to 1.46), but larger for the HUI2 (1.30, 0.67 to 2.55) and VAS (1.05, 0.55 to 2.00).CONCLUSION: The reduced variability in 3 of 5 instruments and good acceptance of computerized HRQoL assessment, if confirmed in larger studies, may lead to smaller sample size requirements, with potential reductions in cost and recruitment time for clinical trials and cohort studies."
"17645680","Assessing differences in utility scores: a comparison of four widely used preference-based instruments.","OBJECTIVES: To characterize the differences in utility scores (dUTY) among four commonly used preference-based Health-Related Quality of Life instruments, to evaluate the potential impact of these differences on cost-utility analyses (CUA), and to determine if sociodemographic/clinical factors influenced the magnitude of these differences.METHODS: Consenting adult Chinese, Malay and Indian subjects in Singapore were interviewed using Singapore English, Chinese, Malay or Tamil versions of the EQ-5D, Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI2) and Mark 3 (HUI3), and SF-6D. Agreement between instruments was assessed using Bland-Altman (BA) plots. Changes in incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) from dUTY were investigated using eight hypothetical decision trees. The influence of sociodemographic/clinical factors on dUTY between instrument pairs was studied using multiple linear regression (MLR) models for English-speaking subjects (circumventing structural zero issues).RESULTS: In 667 subjects (median age 48 years, 59% female), median utility scores ranged from 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80, 0.85) for the EQ-5D to 0.89 (95% CI 0.88, 0.89) for the SF-6D. BA plots: Mean differences (95% CI) exceeded the clinically important difference (CID) of 0.04 for four of six pairwise comparisons, with the exception of the HUI2/EQ-5D (0.03, CI: 0.02, 0.04) and SF-6D/HUI2 (0.02, CI: 0.006, 0.02). Decision trees: The ICER ranged from $94,661/QALY (quality-adjusted life-year; 6.3% difference from base case) to 100,693 dollars/QALY (0.3% difference from base case). MLR: Chronic medical conditions, marital status, and Family Functioning Measures scores significantly (P-value &lt; 0.05) influenced dUTY for several instrument pairs.CONCLUSION: Although CIDs in utility measurements were present for different preference-based instruments, the impact of these differences on CUA appeared relatively minor. Chronic medical conditions, marital status, and family functioning influenced the magnitude of these differences."
"17457630","Construct validity for the Health Utilities Index in a sleep center.","We utilized well-established and validated quality of life (QoL) measures to test the validity of the Health Utilities Index (HUI) in patients with untreated sleep disorders in a cross-sectional study. We submitted a 66-question survey to 86 patients presenting to the University of Maryland Sleep Disorders Center (68 with sleep apnea, 18 with other sleep disorders). HUI mark 2 (HUI2) and HUI mark 3 (HUI3) were compared with other indices of QoL: medical short form 12 (SF-12), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and Functional Outcomes of Sleepiness Questionnaire (FOSQ). The participants of this study were eighty-six patients presenting with untreated sleep disorders to the University Medical Center. There were no interventions. The mean age in our patients was 50.7 +/- 14.2 years with a mean body mass index of 32.9 +/- 7.6. For patients with sleep apnea, the mean respiratory disturbance index was 32.6 +/- 29.1. For all patients, the mean HUI2 score was 0.73 + 0.23, and the mean HUI3 score was 0.6 +/- 0.35 (p = 0.0066 for difference from HUI2). The mean SF-12 physical components (PC) score was 43.6 +/- 12.1, and the mean SF-12 mental components (MC) score was 49.8 identical with 40.1. The mean ESS score was 10.5 + 5.2, and the mean FOSQ score was 16.4 +/- 3.5. Significant bivariate correlations were found between HUI2 and HUI3 as well as between both of these and age, SF-12, SF-12 PC score, ESS, and FOSQ. Stepwise multivariate regression revealed significant independent correlations between HUI2 and age, SF-12 PC and the FOSQ, and between HUI3, SF-12 PC, and the FOSQ. There were no differences in HUI scores between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and non-OSA patients: (1) HUI3 scores are lower than HUI2 scores, (2) both HUI2 and HUI3 are correlated with other indices of QoL in sleep patients, and (3) the HUI surveys should be considered in QoL and economic impact studies in patients with sleep disorders."
"17446823","Health-related quality of life consequences of implantable cardioverter defibrillators: results from MADIT II.","BACKGROUND: Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) improve survival and extend lives of patients with severe heart disease.OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the impact of ICDs on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) during the first 3 years after implantation.SUBJECTS: A total of 1089 patients from the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial II (MADIT II) were randomized to an ICD or medical treatment only.MEASURES: Health Utility Index (HUI3) at baseline, 3, 12, 24, and 36 months following randomization; survival data.RESEARCH DESIGN: We constructed mean profiles of HRQOL for living patients, estimated overall quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), separately by treatment arm, and calculated cumulative QALY gains/losses as the difference between the areas under the treatment specific HRQOL profiles. Multivariate fixed effect regression models were developed to impute the missing HRQOL data using baseline patient characteristics (age, gender, treatment, HUI3 score, diabetes, diuretics use, and NYHA class). Bootstrapped standard errors were calculated for the estimated differences in HRQOL gains/losses between treatment arms. Similarly, we performed subgroup analyses (by gender, age, and baseline NYHA class, blood urine nitrogen, ejection fraction, and QRS).RESULTS: There were no differences in QALYs loss for living patients by treatment group (-0.037, P = 0.64) or in overall QALYs loss by treatment group (0.043, P = 0.37) over 3 years. In subgroup analysis, female subjects demonstrated a trend towards greater survival benefit (0.298, P = 0.07) and overall QALYs (0.261, P = 0.14).CONCLUSIONS: Adverse effects of the ICD on HRQOL together with lower HRQOL among survivors may offset the 3-year survival benefits of ICDs."
"19106731","Relative efficiency of the EQ-5D, HUI2, and HUI3 index scores in measuring health burden of chronic medical conditions in a population health survey in the United States.","OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the ability of the EQ-5D, Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI2), and HUI Mark 3 (HUI3) index scores to discriminate between respondents based on the presence or absence of chronic medical conditions in a population health survey.METHODS: Secondary analyses were conducted with data from a probability sample (n = 3480, mean age: 42.5 years, male: 42.4%, Hispanic: 28.6%) of the 2001 noninstitutionalized US general adult population. F-statistic ratios were used to evaluate the relative efficiency of the EQ-5D, HUI2, and HUI3 in differentiating respondents with or without each of 18 chronic medical conditions, and differentiating respondents with low- or high-burden conditions.RESULTS: In comparing respondents with and without chronic medical conditions, the F-statistic values of these 3 indices were not significantly different, except for EQ-5D versus HUI2 [mean F-statistic ratio: 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.59-0.98]. In comparing respondents with a low-burden condition with those with a high-burden condition, the F-statistic values of EQ-5D and HUI2 index scores were similar, while those for EQ-5D versus HUI3 (mean: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.66-0.92) and for HUI2 versus HUI3 (mean: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.71-0.95) were significantly less than 1.0. The overall ceiling effects of the EQ-5D, HUI2, and HUI3 index scores were 48.9%, 15.4%, and 15.3%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Although the EQ-5D seems to be marginally less informative, the EQ-5D, HUI2, and HUI3 index scores were generally comparable in determining health burden of chronic medical conditions in this population health survey data."
"19067006","Importance of sociodemographic and morbidity aspects in measuring health-related quality of life: performances of three tools: comparison of three questionnaire scores.","BACKGROUND: Since health-related quality of life (HRQL) measures are numerous, comparisons have been suggested.AIM: To compare three HRQL measures: SF6D, HUI3 and EQ5D.METHODS: Three questionnaires (SF36, HUI3, EQ5D) were administered to 1,011 patients attending 16 general practices in two Italian cities. Information about patients' gender, age, education, marital status, smoking, body mass index (BMI) and chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal diseases) were also collected. Questionnaires scores were calculated using the appropriate algorithms; in particular SF6D scores were obtained from SF36 items. Agreement and correlation between questionnaires scores were investigated using Bland and Altman method and Spearman coefficient. The influence of socio-demographic and morbidity indicators on scores was analysed using the nonparametric quantile regression.RESULTS: The Spearman coefficient was about 0.6 for all questionnaires. The 95% limits of agreement of the scores were approximately from -0.5 to 0.3 except for SF6D and EQ5D when they were from -0.4 to 0.2. The measures were influenced by socio-demographic and clinical variables in a similar way, especially SF6D (the index obtained from SF36) and EQ5D, which appeared to be influenced by the same pattern of factors, including gender, chronic diseases, smoking and BMI.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the agreement between questionnaires scores was quite low, whilst the correlation level was good. Questionnaire scores were influenced by socio-demographic and clinical variables in a similar way, especially SF6D and EQ5D. Therefore, the descriptive capacity of SF6D and EQ5D was found to be similar."
"18949580","Health-related quality of life and utilities in primary-care patients with generalized anxiety disorder.","BACKGROUND: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is prevalent and significantly impacts patient health-related quality of life (HRQL) and disability.PURPOSE: This study evaluated the effect of GAD and anxiety symptom severity on the HRQL of primary-care patients with GAD.METHODS: Patients 18 years or older with GAD were recruited from an integrated health care delivery system. Clinical assessments included the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), GAD Questionnaire-IV (GAD-Q-IV), and the Patient Health Questionnaire depression module (PHQ). HRQL was assessed by the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), SF-12 Health Survey (SF-6D), and the Health Utilities Index (HUI2, HUI3).RESULTS: The sample included 297 patients, 72% women with mean +/- standard deviation (SD) age of 47.6 +/- 13.7 years. At baseline, the mean HAM-A score was 16.8 +/- 7.6 (suggesting the presence of moderate anxiety symptoms). Anxiety and depression symptoms were significantly correlated with mental component summary (MCS), Q-LES-Q-SF, SDS, SF-6D, HUI2, and HUI3 scores (all P &lt; 0.001). The mean HRQL and all of the preference-based measures varied significantly by anxiety severity groups (all P &lt; 0.001). Anxiety and depression symptoms significantly predicted HRQL and preference-based scores (R(2) values ranged from 0.22 to 0.57).CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety symptoms reported by GAD patients resulted in significant impairment to HRQL and functional outcomes."
"18948561","Prevalence and factors associated with thriving in older adulthood: a 10-year population-based study.","BACKGROUND: Interest in the determinants of &quot;successful aging&quot; is growing. Nonetheless, successful aging remains ill defined, and its appropriate measurement is hotly contested. Most studies have focused on the absence of disability or deficits in physical performance as outcomes. The present study extends this research by using the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3), a multidimensional measure of health status, to examine the maintenance of exceptionally good health among older participants in the Canadian National Population Health Survey (1994--2004).METHODS: The maintenance of exceptionally good health in old age was examined prospectively among 2432 individuals (65-85 years old at baseline) who met the inclusion criteria. The participants were classified into one of four health trajectories: thrivers (who maintained exceptional health with no or only mild disability), nonthrivers (who experienced a moderate or severe disability), the deceased, and the institutionalized.RESULTS: In 10 years of follow-up, 190 (8%) were thrivers (HUI3 score &gt; or = 0.89 at all interviews), 1076 (47%) were nonthrivers, 893 (36%) died, and 273 (9%) were institutionalized. The maintenance of exceptionally good health among the elderly participants was related to younger age at baseline, socioeconomic status (higher income), psychosocial factors (including lower psychological distress), and behavioral factors (never smoked and moderate alcohol use).CONCLUSIONS: The maintenance of exceptionally good health in old age is related, at least in part, to modifiable lifestyle factors. However, elevated socioeconomic status also distinguishes those who are able to maintain exceptionally good health."
"18489670","Validation of a prediction model to estimate health utilities index Mark 3 utility scores from WOMAC index scores in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip.","OBJECTIVE: To examine the validity of a newly developed prediction model translating osteoarthritis (OA)-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL) scores measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) into generic utility-based HRQL scores measured using the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3).METHODS: Preintervention data from 145 patients with hip OA and complete WOMAC and HUI3 baseline assessments from the Alberta Hip Improvement Project study were used to validate three utility prediction models. These models were estimated using data from a previous study of knee OA patients. Predictive performance was assessed using the mean absolute prediction error (MAE) criterion and several other criteria.RESULTS: The validation sample appeared healthier (on the basis of the HUI3 and WOMAC) than the subjects used toestimate the prediction models. Nevertheless, the validation sample outperformed the predictive performance of the model sample. The results from the validation sample support the conclusions from the original study in that the primary model identified during model development (a model using WOMAC subscales, their interactions, their square terms, age, OA duration, their square terms, and gender) performed better on the MAE criterion than competing models.CONCLUSION: These results support the external validity of the prediction model for the retrospective estimation of HUI3 utility scores for use in economic evaluation."
"18387053","The association of body mass index with health-related quality of life: an exploratory study in a multiethnic Asian population.","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between body mass index (BMI) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a multiethnic Asian population in Singapore, and to explore if the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation of alternative BMI cutoffs for Asians could be further strengthened by evidence of higher risk of impaired HRQoL using these criteria.METHODS: Consenting English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil-speaking primary care patients (age &gt;or= 21 years) were interviewed using English/their respective mother tongue versions of the EQ-5D/EQ-VAS, Health Utilities Index (HUI2 &amp; HUI3) and the SF-6D. We first evaluated the relationship between BMI and HRQoL (overall and individual attributes for each instrument) using multiple linear/logistic regression (where appropriate) to adjust for factors known to affect HRQoL. We next reorganized BMI into five categories (reflecting the differences in cutoffs between International/Asian classifications) and evaluated if median HRQoL scores were significantly different across these categories.RESULTS: Among 411 participants [response rate: 87%; median age: 51 years; obese: 19% (International); 33% (Asian)], after adjusting for sociodemographic and other factors, a tendency for underweight and obese subjects to report lower overall HRQoL scores was observed for most instruments. At the individual attribute level, obese subjects reported significantly lower HUI2 pain scores (regression coefficient: -0.035, P = 0.029) and greater odds of reporting problems for SF-6D role-limitations (odds ratio: 2.9, P = 0.005). Median overall HRQoL scores were not significantly different across the five BMI categories.CONCLUSION: Consistent with available studies, obese subjects reported worse HRQoL than normal-weight subjects. That underweight subjects also reported worse HRQoL is interesting and requires confirmation. HRQoL was similar in Asians using either WHO criteria."
"18380644","Migraine frequency and health utilities: findings from a multisite survey.","OBJECTIVES: Assess the relationship between migraine frequency and health utility.METHODS: Patients aged &gt;/=18 years diagnosed with episodic migraine were enrolled at three US sites representing varied models of health-care delivery. All subjects completed a questionnaire that included demographic and clinical information, a migraine-specific disability questionnaire, and the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3). The HUI3 is a generic health status and health-related quality-of-life measure. HUI3 health status data are translated into utility scores anchored by 0 (dead) and 1 (perfect health).RESULTS: The study enrolled 150 patients. The mean age was 44 years and 87% were female. Mean (+/-SD) monthly migraine frequency was 4.4 +/- 3.6, with 34% reporting &lt;/=2 migraines per month and 20% reporting &gt;6 migraines per month. The mean (+/-SD) HUI3 score was 0.62 +/- 0.26. After controlling for study center, demographics, comorbidities, migraine characteristics, and level of migraine disruptiveness, migraine frequency was found to be significantly (P &lt; 0.05) and negatively associated with HUI3 scores. Subjects with &gt;6 migraines per month had an adjusted mean HUI3 score of 0.41; the corresponding mean for those reporting &lt;/=2 migraines per month was 0.67. Migraine frequency was positively associated with higher levels of disability for the emotion, cognition, and pain components of the HUI3.CONCLUSIONS: Among this group of care-seeking patients, migraineurs' health utilities were inversely related to headache frequency. Although these data may not be generalizable to the entire migraine population, they may be useful in assessing the comparative cost-effectiveness of preventive migraine therapies."
"18179687","The burden of multiple sclerosis: a community health survey.","BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQL) in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) who reside within the community relative to the general population is largely unknown. Data from the Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 1.1 (CCHS 1.1) were used to compare HRQL of persons with MS and the general population.METHODS: A representative sample of adults (18 years or older) from the cross sectional population health survey, CCHS 1.1, was examined to compare scores on the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3), a generic preference-based HRQL measure, of respondents with (n = 302) and without (n = 109,741) MS. Selected sociodemographic covariates were adjusted for in ANCOVA models. Normalized sampling weights and bootstrap variance estimates were used in the analysis.RESULTS: The mean difference in overall HUI3 scores between respondents with and without MS was 0.25 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.31); eight times greater than the clinically important difference. The largest differences in scores were seen with the ambulation (0.26; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.32) and pain attributes (0.14; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.19). Clinically important differences with dexterity and cognition were also observed.CONCLUSION: While the proportion of the Canadian population with MS is relatively small in comparison to other diseases, the magnitude of the burden is severe relative to the general population."
"19851533","Improvement in health-related quality of life after lung transplantation.","OBJECTIVE: Traditional survival outcomes do not reflect the effects on the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of patients. HRQL following lung transplantation has not been studied systematically. The Health Utilities Index (HUI) is a family (HUI2 and HUI3) of measures of HRQL that has not been previously used to assess HRQL in lung transplantation. The objective of the present study was to assess the impact of lung transplantation on patient's HRQL using the HUI.METHODS: A total of 43 patients completed a battery of questionnaires before lung transplantation, and at three months and six months after lung transplantation. The 15-item questionnaire (HUI2 and HUI3) was used. Overall scores were based on a conventional scale (0.00 = dead, 1.00 = perfect health). Mental health was assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Adherence to medication and exercise were assessed by Morisky's and Godin's questionnaires, respectively.RESULTS: Sixty-five per cent of the patients were men, with a mean age of 53 years (range 18 to 67 years). The mean overall HUI3 score for the lung transplant candidates (0.57) was much lower than for the lung transplant recipients (0.82) at six months post-transplantation. This difference was clinically important and statistically significant (P&lt;0.05 [paired t test, degrees of freedom (df) = 35]). Differences in mean Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores after transplantation were statistically significant (P&lt;0.05 [paired t test, df=35]). After six months, transplant recipients were more adherent to medication (P&lt;0.05 [X2 test, df=1]). Recipients were able to increase the duration of exercise at all levels of intensity.CONCLUSION: Lung transplantation improved the patients' HRQL and adherence to medication. Anxiety levels persisted six months after transplantation but depression levels had decreased significantly."

Patients were randomly assigned to treatment by an automated telephone service using a permuted block randomisation technique with block sizes of four or eight, and no stratification.SETTING: Mainland Scotland, with referrals mainly from general practice to 17 hospital trial sites.PARTICIPANTS: Adults (aged 16 years or older) with unilateral facial nerve weakness of no identifiable cause presenting to primary care, the emergency department or NHS24 within 72 hours of symptom onset.INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomised to receive active preparations or placebo for 10 days: (1) prednisolone (50 mg per day, 2 x 25-mg capsules) and aciclovir (2000 mg per day, 5 x 400-mg capsules); (2) prednisolone and placebo (lactose, indistinguishable); (3) aciclovir and placebo; and (4) placebo and placebo.OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was recovery of facial function assessed by the House-Brackmann scale. Secondary outcomes included health status, pain, self-perceived appearance and cost-effectiveness.RESULTS: Final outcomes were available for 496 patients, balanced for gender; mean age 44 years; initial facial paralysis moderate to severe. One half of patients initiated treatment within 24 hours of onset of symptoms, one-third within 24-48 hours and the remainder within 48-72 hours. Of the completed patients, 357 had recovered by 3 months and 80 at 9 months, leaving 59 with a residual deficit. There were significant differences in complete recovery at 3 months between the prednisolone comparison groups (83.0% for prednisolone, 63.6% for no prednisolone, a difference of + 19.4%; 95% confidence interval (CI): + 11.7% to + 27.1%, p &lt; 0.001). The number needed to treat (NNT) in order to achieve one additional complete recovery was 6 (95% CI: 4 to 9). There was no significant difference between the aciclovir comparison groups (71.2% for aciclovir and 75.7% for no aciclovir). Nine-month assessments of patients recovered were 94.4% for prednisolone compared with 81.6% for no prednisolone, a difference of + 12.8% (95% CI: + 7.2% to + 18.4%, p &lt; 0.001); the NNT was 8 (95% CI: 6 to 14). Proportions recovered at 9 months were 85.4% for aciclovir and 90.8% for no aciclovir, a difference of -5.3%. There was no significant prednisolone-aciclovir interaction at 3 months or at 9 months. Outcome differences by individual treatment (the four-arm model) showed significant differences. At 3 months the recovery rate was 86.3% in the prednisolone treatment group, 79.7% in the aciclovir-prednisolone group, 64.7% in the placebo group and 62.5% in the aciclovir group. At 9 months the recovery rates were respectively 96.1%, 92.7%, 85.3% and 78.1%. The increase in recovery rate conferred by the addition of prednisolone (both for prednisolone over placebo and for aciclovir-prednisolone over aciclovir) is highly statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). There were no significant differences in secondary measures apart from Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) at 9 months in those treated with prednisolone.CONCLUSIONS: This study provided robust evidence to support the early use of oral prednisolone in Bell's palsy as an effective treatment which may be considered cost-effective. Treatment with aciclovir, either alone or with steroids, had no effect on outcome."
"19527920","Do the determinants of health differ between people living in the community and in institutions?","Determinants of health studies have mainly dealt with samples of community-dwelling subjects. We utilized the 1996/97 Canadian National Population Health Survey community and institutional surveys to identify factors associated with the selection of individuals to institutions. We also assessed whether the same determinants of health variables explain variations in health in those living in the community and those living in institutions. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate factors associated with selection to institutions. Results showed that health status, age, chronic conditions, education, race, marital status, smoking and alcohol were associated with the probability of being in an institution. Multiple linear regression analyses (dependent variable: Health Utilities Index Mark 3 [HUI3] score) with individual characteristics, socio-economic status, and health risk factors were also estimated. Results showed that advanced age, higher number of chronic conditions, lower education, smoking and being an alcohol non-drinker were negatively and significantly associated with HUI3 scores for the community sample. Except for age, chronic conditions and being an alcohol non-drinker, none of these factors were significantly associated with HUI3 for the institutional sample. Moreover, the association between age and HUI3 was weaker for the institutional sample in comparison to the community sample. Implications are that, for those who are institutionalized, the usual determinants of health factors are less important. In conclusion, there appears to be important heterogeneity in determinants of health between persons living in the institution and community."
"19490557","Valuing condition-specific health states using simulation contact lenses.","OBJECTIVE: This article reports on a study that used contact lenses to simulate the effects of a visual impairment caused by age-related macular degeneration (ARMD). The primary objective was to examine the feasibility of using this method of simulation. A secondary objective was to compare the results from this experiment with those obtained from ARMD patients (n = 209) using generic preference-based measures (Health Utilities Index 3 (HUI3) and EUROQOL 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and patient time trade-off (TTO).METHODS: Utility values were elicited from healthy participants (n = 108) for three ARMD states simulated using contact lenses.RESULTS: A significant relationship was found between visual acuity and TTO values elicited from our sample population (n = 108). It was stronger than that found for HUI3, EQ-5D, and own TTO values from patients (n = 209). Our sample values informed by the experience of simulation were found to be significantly different from values from patient TTO and generic preference-based measures obtained from patients for the same level of visual impairment. Sociodemographic characteristics did not significantly affect results, although baseline TTO utility values were positively associated with TTO values for simulated states. Nevertheless, the patient population was significantly older than the sample population.CONCLUSIONS: ARMD has a major impact on our sample values TTO health state values. Differences across four visual health severity groups appear larger than those found for a generic preference-based measure and patient TTO values. For conditions that are difficult to describe and imagine, simulation methods may offer an additional tool when combined with usual methods of description for obtaining better informed general population preferences."
"19473334","Effects of mode and order of administration on generic health-related quality of life scores.","OBJECTIVE: We evaluate the effects of mode and order of administration on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) scores.METHOD: We analyzed HRQOL data from the Clinical Outcomes and Measurement of Health Study (COMHS). In COMHS, we enrolled patients with heart failure or cataracts at three sites (University of California, San Diego, University of California, Los Angeles, and University of Wisconsin). Patients completed self-administered HRQOL instruments at baseline and months 1 and 6 post-baseline, including the EuroQol (EQ-5D), Health Utilities Index (HUI), Quality of Well-Being Scale--self-administered (QWB-SA), and the Short Form (SF)-36v2. At the 6 months follow-up, individuals were randomized to mail or telephone administration first, followed by the other mode of administration. We used repeated measures mixed effects models, adjusting for site, patient age, education, gender, and race.RESULTS: Included were 121 individuals entering a heart failure program and 326 individuals scheduled for cataract surgery who completed the survey by mail or phone at the 6-month follow-up. The majority of the sample was female (53%) and white (86%). About a quarter of the sample had high school education or less (26%). The average age was 66 (36-91 range). HRQOL scores were higher (more positive) for phone administration following mail administration. The largest differences in scores between phone and mail responses occurred for comparisons of telephone responses for those who were randomized to a mail survey first compared with mail responses for those randomized to a telephone survey first (i.e., mode effects for responses that were given on the second administration of the HRQOL measures). The QWB-SA was the only measure that did not display the pattern of mode effects. The biggest differences between modes were 4 points on the SF-36v2 physical health and mental health component summary scores, 0.06 on the SF-6D, 0.03 on the QWB-SA, 0.08 on the EQ-5D, 0.04 on the HUI2, and 0.10 on the HUI3.CONCLUSIONS: Telephone administration yields significantly more positive HRQOL scores for all of the generic HRQOL measures except for the QWB-SA. The magnitude of effects was clearly important, with some differences as large as a half-standard deviation. These findings confirm the importance of considering mode of administration when interpreting HRQOL scores."
"19277898","The construct validity of the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 in assessing mental health in population health surveys.","PURPOSE: To examine the construct validity of the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) by exploring relationships among several well-recognized measures of mental health, the K6 and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), and the HUI3 in a large, nationally representative sample of community-dwelling subjects. Known-group comparisons were also included in the validation process.METHODS: We specified a priori hypotheses about the expected degree of association between the measures. Correlation coefficients of &lt;0.1 were defined as negligible, 0.1 to &lt;0.3 as small, 0.3 to &lt;0.5 as medium, and &gt; or =0.5 as large. Data from the Statistics Canada National Population Health Survey (NPHS) Cycle 2 (1996/97) for respondents 20 years of age or older (n = 66,435) were used to test the a priori hypotheses.RESULTS: In 58.1% of cases, predictions of association were correct. Predictions were off by one category in 38.9% of cases and a priori predictions were off by two categories in 3.0% of cases.CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence supporting the cross-sectional construct validity of the HUI3 emotion and HUI3 in a nationally representative sample of the community-dwelling population. The results also provide further evidence of the cross-sectional construct validity of the HUI3 in assessing population health."
"20920198","The construct validity of the health utilities index mark 3 in assessing health status in lung transplantation.","PURPOSE: To assess the cross-sectional construct validity of the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) in lung transplantation.METHODS: Two hundred and thirteen patients (103 pre-transplant and 110 post-transplant) with mean age 53 years old (SD 13) were recruited during a randomized controlled clinical trial at the out-patient clinic in a tertiary institution. At baseline, patients self-completed measures that included the HUI3, EuroQol EQ-5D, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and socio-demographic questionnaire. Six-minute walk test scores and forced expiratory volume in 1 second data were collected from patient's medical records. A priori hypotheses were formulated by members of the transplant team about the expected degree of association between the measures. Correlation coefficients of &lt; 0.1 were considered as negligible, 0.1 to &lt; 0.3 as small, 0.3 to &lt; 0.5 as medium, and = 0.5 as large.RESULTS: Of the ninety predictions made, forty three were correct but in 31 the correlation was slightly lower than predicted and in 7 the correlations were much higher than predicted. In 48% of the cases, predicted and observed associations were in agreement. Predictions of associations were off by one category in 42% of the cases; in 10% of the cases the predictions were off by two categories.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study providing evidence of cross-sectional construct validity of HUI3 in lung transplantation. Results indicate that the HUI3 was able to capture the burden of lung disease before transplantation and that post-transplant patients enjoyed higher health-related quality of life than pre-transplant patients."
"20678681","Relationship between rheumatoid arthritis disease severity, health-related utility, and resource use in Australian patients: A cross-sectional, multicenter study.","OBJECTIVES: This research explores the relationship between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) severity measures, clinical characteristics, and patient preference-based health-related quality of life (ie, utility) in Australian RA patients. A secondary objective was to investigate the relationship between a range of disease severity measures, clinical characteristics, and the cost of RA-related resource use.METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, multicenter study of consecutive patients with RA aged &gt; or =18 years attending routine clinical appointments. Patients completed a questionnaire comprising general demographic, resource use, and disease-specific questions; the RA-specific Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ); and 2 multiattribute preference-based quality-of-life (utility) instruments, the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) and the EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D). A second questionnaire was completed by the patient's rheumatologist, with questions on key clinical data pertinent to RA, including the number and location of tender joints and swollen joints, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration, current and previous treatments, and details of important comorbid conditions. Data on RA-specific resource use were also collected, including health-professional visits (eg, general practitioner, specialist, nurse, occupational therapist, paid caregivers), hospital admissions, surgery, and RA-associated home modifications. Spearman nonparametric correlation, simple linear, multiple, and stepwise regression analyses were used to explore the relationship between utility scores (HUI3 and EQ-5D) and variables including HAQ, RA-related resource use, and key demographic, physical, and biochemical measures.RESULTS: A total of 170 patients were recruited from 4 centers in Australia. Consistent with the epidemiology of RA, the ratio of women to men was approximately 3:1 (126 vs 44, respectively). Male and female patients were of similar age (mean [SD], 59.2 [12.9] and 58.9 [12.2] years, respectively). Time since diagnosis of RA was significantly shorter for men than for women (mean difference, -4.52 years; 95% CI, -8.65 to -0.38; P = 0.03). Of all the disease severity measures and clinical characteristics investigated, patients' HAQ scores predicted their utility most closely (for HUI3, R(2) = 0.626, P &lt; 0.001; for EQ-5D, R(2) = 0.403, P &lt; 0.001). The Disease Activity Score 28 severity index provided the next best relationship with a patient's utility; however, its explanatory power was poor (for HUI3, R(2) = 0.085, P &lt; 0.001; for EQ-5D, R(2) = 0.042, P = 0.008). ESR, CRP, and, RA-affected joint counts had negligible explanatory power for patient utility. In analyses of the relationship between a range of key variables and the direct costs associated with RA, the HAQ score explained 22% of the variability in log costs (P &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSION: This study found that of all the disease severity measures and clinical characteristics investigated, patients' HAQ scores predicted their utility most closely."
"20570982","The measurement of long-term health-related quality of life after injury: comparison of EQ-5D and the health utilities index.","OBJECTIVE: Empirical head-to-head comparison of the health utility index (HUI) mark 2 and 3 and the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) in injury patients of all severity levels to obtain more insight into the strengths and limitations of the multi-attribute utility measures (MAUI) to estimate utility losses in injury populations.DESIGN: A self-assessment survey that included the EQ-5D, HUI2 and HUI3 to measure generic health-related quality of life.PATIENTS: Injury patients in The Netherlands 2 years after they attended the emergency department.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Shannon's index and Shannon's evenness index were used to assess absolute and relative informativity, both for the summary scores and by dimension. The study also analysed convergent and construct validity of the MAUI.RESULTS: Mean summary scores significantly differed between the instruments, with highest summary scores for HUI2 (0.88), followed by HUI3 (0.80) and EQ-5D (0.78). Absolute and relative informativity by dimension was highest for the HUI3 descriptive system. The HUI3 was most sensitive for ageing and comorbidity. The largest differences between the MAUI were found for pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression/emotion. The largest differences in discriminative power between EQ-5D and HUI (mark 2 and 3) were seen for skull-brain injury, internal organ injury and upper extremity fractures.CONCLUSIONS: Different MAUI resulted in significantly different summary scores. The instruments and their dimensions performed differently for injury severity levels, ageing, comorbidity and injury groups. A combination of the HUI and EQ-5D should be used in studies on injury-related disability, because the combination covers all relevant health dimensions, is applicable in all kinds of injury populations and in widely different age ranges."
"20496168","Gender differences in health-related quality-of-life are partly explained by sociodemographic and socioeconomic variation between adult men and women in the US: evidence from four US nationally representative data sets.","PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe gender differences in self-reported health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) and to examine whether differences are explained by sociodemographic and socioeconomic status (SES) differentials between men and women.METHODS: Data were from four US nationally representative surveys: US Valuation of the EuroQol EQ-5D Health States Survey (USVEQ), Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), National Health Measurement Study (NHMS) and Joint Canada/US Survey of Health (JCUSH). Gender differences were estimated with and without adjustment for sociodemographic and SES indicators using regression within and across data sets with SF-6D, EQ-5D, HUI2, HUI3 and QWB-SA scores as outcomes.RESULTS: Women have lower HRQoL scores than men on all indexes prior to adjustment. Adjusting for age, race, marital status, education and income reduced but did not remove the gender differences, except with HUI3. Adjusting for marital status or income had the largest impact on estimated gender differences.CONCLUSIONS: There are clear gender differences in HRQoL in the United States. These differences are partly explained by sociodemographic and SES differentials."
"20429875","Comparing population health in the United States and Canada.","BACKGROUND: The objective of the paper is to compare population health in the United States (US) and Canada. Although the two countries are very similar in many ways, there are potentially important differences in the levels of social and economic inequality and the organization and financing of and access to health care in the two countries.METHODS: Data are from the Joint Canada/United States Survey of Health 2002/03. The Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) was used to measure overall health-related quality of life (HRQL). Mean HUI3 scores were compared, adjusting for major determinants of health, including body mass index, smoking, education, gender, race, and income. In addition, estimates of life expectancy were compared. Finally, mean HUI3 scores by age and gender and Canadian and US life tables were used to estimate health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE).RESULTS: Life expectancy in Canada is higher than in the US. For those &lt; 40 years, there were no differences in HRQL between the US and Canada. For the 40+ group, HRQL appears to be higher in Canada. The results comparing the white-only population in both countries were very similar. For a 19-year-old, HALE was 52.0 years in Canada and 49.3 in the US.CONCLUSIONS: The population of Canada appears to be substantially healthier than the US population with respect to life expectancy, HRQL, and HALE. Factors that account for the difference may include access to health care over the full life span (universal health insurance) and lower levels of social and economic inequality, especially among the elderly."
"20189839","The reliability and validity of the Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand, EuroQol-5D, Health Utilities Index, and Short Form-6D outcome instruments in patients with proximal humeral fractures.","HYPOTHESIS: The Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, Hand (DASH), EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D), Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3), and Short Form (SF)-6D questionnaires are reliable and valid measures of functional outcome and health state values in patients with proximal humeral fractures.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients aged 55 and older treated for a proximal humeral fracture during a 5-year period completed the DASH, EQ-5D, HUI3, and SF-12 questionnaires. Test-retest reliability was quantified using intraclass correlation (ICC 2,1) and Bland-Altman agreement statistics during a second administration of the questionnaires. Correlations between the 4 study instruments, the SF-12, and a subjective global assessment of shoulder function were used to test construct validity. Ceiling/floor effects were quantified for each questionnaire.RESULTS: Sixty-one individuals (mean age, 69+/-10 years) participated. ICC showed the reliability (95% confidence interval) was 0.926 (0.860-0.963) for the DASH, 0.783 (0.604-0.875) for the EQ-5D, 0.794 (0.634-0.889) for the SF-6D, and 0.469 (0.184-0.686) for the HUI3. The Bland-Altman limits of agreement, however, highlighted limitations for repeated measurements with all 4 instruments at the individual patient level. Moderate construct validity was confirmed for all instruments. A significant ceiling effect was observed with the EQ-5D: 30% of participants reported &quot;perfect health,&quot; compared with less than 7% with DASH, HUI3, or SF-6D questionnaires.DISCUSSION: The DASH and SF-6D questionnaires demonstrated the best psychometric properties among the study instruments. These results support their use as appropriate measures of functional outcome and health state values in patients with proximal humeral fractures."
"22193054","Health-related quality of life and comorbidities associated with lumbar spinal stenosis.","BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Spinal stenosis is one of the most commonly diagnosed pathologies of the lumbar spine and the leading indication for spine surgery in adults aged 65 years and older. Yet, the burden of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) alone, and in combination with common comorbidities, on health-related quality of life (HRQL) is unknown as are comorbidities specifically associated with this chronic condition.PURPOSE: To estimate the illness burden of LSS on HRQL, adjusting for the effects of specific comorbidities, age, and gender, and investigate whether specific comorbidities are associated with the condition.SETTING: A community-based cohort of 245 patients diagnosed with LSS was assembled and compared with a representative sample of 7,489 adults from the base population of Albertans responding to the Canadian Community Health Survey on HRQL and comorbidities.METHODS: Health-related quality-of-life data were acquired through interviews for both groups using the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3). Both groups were also queried about the presence of 13 specific chronic conditions. Linear regression was used to model HUI3 scores as a function of group, age, gender, and specific comorbid conditions. Logistic regression was used to compare the odds of having particular comorbid conditions between the LSS and general population groups.RESULTS: The mean unadjusted overall HUI3 scores were 0.60 for the LSS group and 0.85 for the general population (1=perfect health). After adjustment, HRQL deficits four times that deemed a clinically important difference remained between the groups. Controlling age and gender, the prevalence of arthritis, migraines, hypertension, and incontinence was significantly greater in the LSS group as compared with the general population sample.CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosed LSS is associated with a very substantial burden of illness that is compounded by associated comorbidities, with implications for clinical care, health-care policy decisions, and research. Attention to comorbidities is particularly important in LSS."
"22152124","Health state utilities of a population of Nigerian hypertensive patients.","BACKGROUND: Establishment of the health impact of hypertension on quality of life of Nigerians is a step towards controlling the disease. The study aimed to provide a Nigerian specific reference list of utility scores of hypertensive patients with various interacting conditions.FINDINGS: An interviewer-based, cross-sectional study was conducted using hypertensive patients in two purposively selected tertiary hospitals located in South-Eastern Nigeria. Health Utility Index Mark 3 (HUI3) was used.A total of 384 participants with either hypertension alone or with hypertension-associated complications were interviewed in the two tertiary hospitals.The overall mean utility score was 0.35 +/- 0.42. Patients with hypertension alone had the highest overall mean utility score (0.57 +/- 0.29) while hypertensive patients with stroke had the lowest overall mean score (0.04 +/- 0.36). Being a male, increase in age and mean arterial blood pressure, emergency visit and loss of work due to illness were associated with significant decrease in overall utility scores.CONCLUSIONS: This study presented a reference for health state utilities of a population of Nigerian hypertensive patients."
"21298347","Health-related quality of life in adults reporting arthritis: analysis from the National Health Measurement Study.","BACKGROUND: Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in the United States. We assess the generic health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults with and without self-reported arthritis.METHODS: The NHMS, a cross-sectional survey of 3,844 adults (35-89 years) administered EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D), Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI2) and 3 (HUI3), SF-36v2, Quality of Well-being Scale self-administered form (QWB-SA), and the Health and Activities Limitations index (HALex) to each respondent via a telephone interview. Weighted multiple linear regression was used to generate age-gender-arthritis-stratified unadjusted HRQOL means and means adjusted for sociodemographic, socioeconomic covariates and comorbidities by arthritis-age category.RESULTS: The estimated population prevalence of self-reported arthritis was 31%. People with arthritis were more likely to be woman, older, of lower socioeconomic status, and had more self-reported comorbidities than were those not reporting arthritis. Adults with arthritis had lower HRQOL on six different indexes compared with adults without arthritis, with overall differences ranging from 0.03 (QWB-SA, age-group 65-74) to 0.17 (HUI3, age-group 35-44; all P-value &lt; .05).CONCLUSION: Arthritis in adults is associated with poorer HRQOL. We provide age-related reference values for six generic HRQOL measures in people with arthritis."
"23204877","Patient-reported outcome 2 years after lung transplantation: does the underlying diagnosis matter?","PURPOSE: Transplantation has the potential to produce profound effects on survival and health-related quality of life (HRQL). The inclusion of the patient's perspective may play an important role in the assessment of the effectiveness of lung transplantation. Patient perspectives are assessed by patient-reported outcome measures, including HRQL measures. We describe how patients' HRQL among different diagnosis groups can be used by clinicians to monitor and evaluate the outcomes associated with transplantation.METHODS: Consecutive lung transplant recipients attending the lung transplant outpatient clinic in a tertiary institution completed the 15-item Health Utilities Index (HUI) questionnaire on a touchscreen computer. The results were available to clinicians at every patient visit. The HUI3 covers a range of severity and comorbidities in eight dimensions of health status. Overall HUI3 scores are on a scale in which dead = 0.00 and perfect health = 1.00; disability categories range from no disability = 1 to severe disability &lt;0.70. Single-attribute and overall HUI3 scores were used to compare patients' HRQL among different diagnosis groups. Random-effect models with time since transplant as a random variable and age, gender, underlying diagnoses, infections, and broncholitis obliterans syndrome as fixed variables were built to identify determinants of health status at 2-years posttransplantation.RESULTS: Two hundred and fourteen lung transplant recipients of whom 61% were male with a mean age of 52 (19-75) years were included in the study. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis patients displayed moderate disability, while pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary arterial hypertension patients displayed severe disability. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had the worst pain level, whereas patients with pulmonary fibrosis had the worst emotion and cognition levels. A random-effect model confirmed that development of broncholitis obliterans syndrome was the most important determinant of health status (P = 0.03) compared to other variables, such as cytomegalovirus infections and underlying diagnoses.CONCLUSION: Descriptions of patients' HRQL among different diagnosis groups could be used by clinicians to assist individualized patient care."
"23164316","Health outcomes among youths and adults with spina bifida.","OBJECTIVE: To describe the health and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) outcomes of youths and young adults with spina bifida.STUDY DESIGN: One global rating of self-rated health and 2 generic measures of HR-QoL were administered to a group of youths and young adults with spina bifida. HR-QoL was measured using the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) and the Assessment of Quality of Life version 1 (AQoL).RESULTS: Data was obtained from 40 youth (mean age 16.0 years) and 13 young adults (mean age 26.6 years). Most youth rated their overall health as either excellent or very good (65%) compared with fewer adults (23%) (P = .007). The mean HR-QoL scores for youths versus adults were 0.57 versus 0.36 (P = .03) for the HUI(3) and 0.37 versus 0.25 for the AQoL (P = .09). HUI(3) and AQoL scores were correlated with level of anatomic lesion (rho = 0.64 and rho = 0.42, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: The HR-QoL of youths and young adults with spina bifida was low on measures that are aggregated using societal values (the HUI3 and AQoL). This is in contrast to their single global self-ratings of health, which were more favorable. These findings underscore the distinction between ratings of HR-QoL based on societal values versus the personal lived experiences of adults with childhood-onset disability."

There are two current HUI systems: HUI2 and HUI3. Since no Thai version of self-administered HUI was available, the study objective was to translate and test the psychometric properties of the HUI self-complete Thai-language questionnaire in terms of practicality, reliability, validity and responsiveness. A convenience sample of 216 outpatients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) was selected. Mean age was 60.3  7.2 (range 37-77) and 37.2% were males. The floor and ceiling effects of the total scores for both HUI were &lt;15%. The intraclass correlation coefficients were from moderate to high for all attributes and total scores. The correlations of HUI2 and HUI3 when compared with the EQ-5D and MacNew global scores were high (Spearman's rho &gt; 0.5, P &lt; 0.001). Discriminant validity was proved among three groups of different specific activity scale classes (P &lt; 0.001). The effect size was the highest (0.92) in the patients reporting worsened health status assessed by the HUI2. In conclusion, both of the HUIs demonstrated conditionally satisfactory psychometric properties in the patients with IHD."
"22941670","Interpersonal discrimination and health-related quality of life among black and white men and women in the United States.","OBJECTIVE: We assessed associations between discrimination and health-related quality of life among black and white men and women in the United States.METHODS: We examined data from the National Health Measurement Study, a nationally representative sample of 3,648 adults aged 35-89 in the non-institutionalized US population. These data include self-reported lifetime and everyday discrimination as well as several health utility indexes (EQ-5D, HUI3, and SF-6D). Multiple regression was used to compute mean health utility scores adjusted for age, income, education, and chronic diseases for each race-by-gender subgroup.RESULTS: Black men and women reported more discrimination compared to white men and women. Health utility tended to be worse as reported discrimination increased. With a few exceptions, differences between mean health utility scores in the lowest and highest discrimination groups exceeded the 0.03 difference generally considered to be a clinically significant difference.CONCLUSIONS: Persons who experienced discrimination tended to score lower on health utility measures. The study also revealed a complex relationship between experiences of discrimination and race and gender. Because of these differential social and demographic relationships caution is urged when interpreting self-rated health measures in research, clinical, and policy settings."

The final model retained squared terms for CD4 counts, age, and time since HIV diagnosis and eliminated history of AIDS-defining condition and the nonsquared time since HIV diagnosis. Prediction error was assessed in 14 subgroups using the validation set. Two subgroups had mean prediction errors greater than 0.02. Limitations. All statistical models are limited by the data used to develop and test the model. The model estimates health utility scores primarily through CD4 counts. Therefore, the model may be inappropriate if noninfectious diseases are a significant factor.Results provide a model for predicting health preference values from CD4 counts.</AbstractText>: Results provide a model for predicting health preference values from CD4 counts."

"22352152","Strategies for handling normality assumptions in multi-level modeling: a case study estimating trajectories of Health Utilities Index Mark 3 scores.","BACKGROUND: With longitudinal data, lifetime health statuso dynamics can be estimated by modeling trajectories. Health status trajectories measured by the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) modeled as a function of age alone and also of age and socio-economic covariates revealed non-normal residuals and variance estimation problems. The possibility of transforming the HUI3 distribution to obtain residuals that approximate a normal distribution was investigated.DATA AND METHODS: The analysis is based on longitudinal data from the first six cycles of the National Population Health Survey (NPHS). The data pertain to 7,784 individuals, who, in 1994/1995, were aged 40 to 99, were living in private households, and had complete information on HUI3. A multilevel growth model was used to examine the hierarchical structure of NPHS data (repeated measurements nesting within respondents). The transformation of arcsine [2 x (HUI + 0.36) / (1 + 0.36)-1] was used to improve the distribution of the residuals at both levels and limit the conditional mean to the -0.36 to 1.00 interval. A model was estimated using socio-economic determinants. Analyses were performed with SAS and MLwiN.RESULTS: After the transformation of HUI3, the model was satisfactory and allowed for inclusion of new socio-demographic and health variables in order to estimate their impact on the health-related quality of life of aging populations. Because of the complex transformation of the arcsine model, the regression coefficients were not interpreted. Instead, the estimation results were summarized graphically."

Patients were followed over 24  3 months with intermediate data points at 6  2 months and 12  2 months, and a limited data point at 2.5  1 month that coincided with the end of the loading phase. Outcomes included visual acuity (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study), visual function (National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 [NEI VFQ-25]), quality of life (Health Utilities Index Mark III [HUI3]), and safety.RESULTS: A total of 267 patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (mean  standard deviation [SD] age = 78.5  7.3 years; 62.4% were female; 34.5% with dual eye involvement; 74.9% were treatment-nave) were treated (309 eyes were treated). The mean  SD Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study score at baseline was 56.3  14.3 letters. The mean  SD number of injections over 24 months was 7.6  4.1, including 2.5  0.7 and 5.9  3.6 during the loading and maintenance phases, respectively, with corresponding treatment intervals of 4.8  1.4 weeks and 11.5  9.5 weeks, respectively. Improvements in visual acuity over baseline were reached at 2.5 months and maintained at 6 months (both P &lt; 0.0001). The mean visual acuity increase over baseline at 12 months was not significant (P = 0.08); the decline over baseline at 24 months statistically significant (P = 0.02). Overall, 94.3% of patients showed stable or improved disease at 6 months and 81.5% of patients showed stable or improved disease at 24 months. At 6 months, improvements over baseline were significant for VFQ-25 (P = 0.03) and HUI3 (P = 0.02), but not at 12 months and 24 months. Improvements in VFQ-25 and HUI3 were maintained at 24 months in 38% and 34% of patients, respectively. In total 78 serious adverse events were reported in 40 patients and 77 nonserious adverse events in 34 patients. Nine serious adverse events and nine nonserious adverse events in 14 patients were suspected to be related to ranibizumab treatment.CONCLUSION: The &quot;real-world&quot; clinical effectiveness of ranibizumab was evidenced by the initial improvements over baseline in visual acuity and quality of life, as well as the maintenance of these outcomes at baseline levels at 24 months, and this was observed under variable treatment conditions. The findings underscore the need for individualized treatment with regular monitoring to achieve optimal vision and quality of life outcomes."
"24004384","A systematic literature review of utility weights in wet age-related macular degeneration.","OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to conduct a systematic review of utility weight estimates relevant to economic models for wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD).METHODS: A systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and EconLit was performed (January 1995-December 2010) and then updated (October 2010-May 2012; February 2012-July 2013) identifying articles reporting utilities in patients with wAMD and visual impairment. Extracted studies were also assessed for compliance with the NICE reference case.RESULTS: Of 2415 articles identified from the searches, 212 articles were reviewed in full, and 17 selected for data extraction. Most studies used time trade-off (TTO) techniques to estimate utilities; other methods included standard gamble, EuroQoL Health Questionnaire 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D); Short-Form 6D Health Status Questionnaire (SF-6D); and Health Utilities Index Mark III (HUI3). Correlation between utility estimates and visual acuity (VA) differed between the instruments. Time trade-off methods were more sensitive to VA changes than standard gamble methods. HUI3 estimates were most highly correlated with VA changes, followed by TTO; no trend was observed between VA and EQ-5D or SF-6D utility weights. Six of the 17 studies complied with the NICE reference case.CONCLUSIONS: Several instruments have been used to elicit utilities from patients with wAMD. Because TTO methods were more sensitive to VA changes than standard gamble and HUI3 estimates were most highly correlated with VA changes, TTO and HUI3 may be suitable methods for economic evaluations in these patients. The EQ-5D and SF-6D were poor indicators of the impact of VA on HRQL."

EP/ELBW adolescents reported similar overall quality of life, health status, and self-esteem as controls (P &gt; .05). Birth at younger gestational age or lower birth weight were not related to poorer quality of life within the EP/ELBW cohort (P &gt; .05). EP/ELBW adolescents reported less physical activity (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.8; P &lt; .01), sexual activity (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9; P = .01), and alcohol intake (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.8; P = .01) compared with controls. Other aspects of risk-taking behavior were similar in the 2 groups (P &gt; .05).CONCLUSION: EP/ELBW individuals born after the introduction of exogenous surfactant are transitioning well into young adulthood, despite the fact that more of the tiniest and most immature infants survive than ever before. They report similar quality of life, self-esteem, and social and risk-taking behaviors as controls."
"23618072","Do generic utility measures capture what is important to the quality of life of people with multiple sclerosis?","PURPOSE: The three most widely used utility measures are the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 and 3 (HUI2 and HUI3), the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) and the Short-Form-6D (SF-6D). In line with guidelines for economic evaluation from agencies such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH), these measures are currently being used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different interventions in MS. However, the challenge of using such measures in people with a specific health condition, such as MS, is that they may not capture all of the domains that are impacted upon by the condition. If important domains are missing from the generic measures, the value derived will be higher than the real impact creating invalid comparisons across interventions and populations. Therefore, the objective of this study is to estimate the extent to which generic utility measures capture important domains that are affected by MS.METHODS: The available study population consisted of men and women who had been registered after 1994 in three participating MS clinics in Greater Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Subjects were first interviewed on an individualized measure of quality of life (QOL) called the Patient Generated Index (PGI). The domains identified with the PGI were then classified and grouped together using the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), and mapped onto the HUI2, HUI3, EQ-5D and SF-6D.RESULTS: A total of 185 persons with MS were interviewed on the PGI. The sample was relatively young (mean age 43) and predominantly female. Both men and women had mild disability with a median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 2. The top 10 domains that patients identified to be the most affected by their MS were, work (62%), fatigue (48%), sports (39%), social life (28%), relationships (23%), walking/mobility (22%), cognition (21%), balance (14%), housework (12%) and mood (11%). The SF-6D included the most number of domains (6 domains) important to people with MS, followed by the EQ-5D (4 domains) and the HUI2 (4 domains) and then the HUI3 (3 domains). The mean and standard deviation (SD) for the PGI, EQ-5D and the SF-6D were 0.50 (SD 0.25), 0.69 (0.18) and 0.69 (0.13), respectively. The magnitude of difference between the PGI and the generic utility measures was large and statistically significant.CONCLUSION: Although the generic utility measures included certain items that were important to people with MS, there were several that were missing. An important consequence of this mismatch was that values of QOL derived from the PGI were importantly and significantly lower than those estimated using any of the generic utility measures. This could have a substantial impact in evaluating the effect of interventions for people with MS."

QoL data were assessed by the Health Utility Index (HUI3) and the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25).RESULTS: 154 patients (17.5% OHT, 27.9% early, 22.7% moderate, and 31.8% advanced POAG) were included. The HUI3 scores for OHT, early, moderate, and advanced POAG were 0.87  0.09, 0.85  0.15, 0.75  0.23, and 0.58  0.32, respectively. Compared to a normal population matched by age and gender, for moderate and severe POAG a difference of -0.06  0.24 and -0.19  0.28, respectively, was observed. NEI-VFQ-25 scores illustrate different dimensions of the impact on QoL; reduced peripheral vision or difficulties to drive a car were more crucial to glaucoma patients than social factors.CONCLUSIONS: The key difference for QoL impairment in glaucoma lies between OHT/early POAG versus moderate/severe POAG, hence every possible effort needs to be made to prevent disease progression over this threshold."
"23564620","A reference set of health utilities for long-term survivors of prostate cancer: population-based data from Ontario, Canada.","PURPOSE: To measure quality of life (QOL) and utilities for prostate cancer (PC) patients and determine their predictors.METHODS: A population-based, community-dwelling, geographically diverse sample of long-term PC survivors in Ontario, Canada, was identified from the Ontario Cancer Registry and contacted through their referring physician. Consenting patients completed questionnaires by mail: Health Utilities Index (HUI 2/3), Patient Oriented Prostate Utility Scale PORPUS-U (utility), PORPUS-P (health profile), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P), and Prostate Cancer Index (PCI). Clinical data were obtained from chart reviews. Regression models determined the effects of a series of variables on QOL and utility.RESULTS: We received questionnaires and reviewed charts for 585 patients (mean age 72.6, 2-13years postdiagnosis). Mean utility scores were as follows: PORPUS-U=0.92, HUI2=0.85, and HUI3=0.78. Mean health profile scores were as follows: PORPUS-P=71.7, PCI sexual, urinary, and bowel function=23.7, 79.1, and 84.6, respectively (0=worst, 100=best), and FACT-P=125.1 (0=worst, 156=best). In multiple regression analyses, comorbidity and PCI urinary, sexual, and bowel function were significant predictors of other QOL measures. With all variables, 32-50% of the variance in utilities was explained.CONCLUSIONS: Many variables affect global QOL of PC survivors; only prostate symptoms and comorbidity have independent effects. Our model allows estimation of the effects of multiple factors on utilities. These utilities for long-term outcomes of PC and its treatment are valuable for decision/cost-effectiveness models of PC treatment."
"23306666","Erratum to: Interpersonal discrimination and health-related quality of life among black and white men and women in the United States.","OBJECTIVE: We assessed associations between discrimination and health-related quality of life among black and white men and women in the United States.METHODS: We examined data from the National Health Measurement Study, a nationally representative sample of 3,648 adults aged 35-89 in the non-institutionalized US population. These data include self-reported lifetime and everyday discrimination as well as several health utility indexes (EQ-5D, HUI3, and SF-6D). Multiple regression was used to compute mean health utility scores adjusted for age, income, education, and chronic diseases for each race-by-gender subgroup.RESULTS: Black men and women reported more discrimination than white men and women. Health utility tended to be worse as reported discrimination increased. With a few exceptions, differences between mean health utility scores in the lowest and highest discrimination groups exceeded the 0.03 difference generally considered to be a clinically significant difference.CONCLUSIONS: Persons who experienced discrimination tended to score lower on health utility measures. The study also revealed a complex relationship between experiences of discrimination and race and gender. Because of these differential social and demographic relationships caution is urged when interpreting self-rated health measures in research, clinical, and policy settings."

Members of group 1 reported stable scores as they made the transition to adulthood, while many of the group 2 members experienced declines, with relative risk of 1.47 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-2.24) on the GMFCS, 1.36 (95% CI, 0.83-2.23) on the SRH, 1.19 (95% CI, 0.66-2.15) on the HUI3, and 3.17 (95% CI, 1.12-9.00) on the AQoL.CONCLUSIONS: Although much attention has focused on the transitions of persons with CP during their late teens and early 20s, this research found that deteriorations in the GMFCS levels and the HRQOL were most evident in adults in their late 20s and 30s. More detailed longitudinal studies are required to evaluate the longer-term health outcomes among persons with CP into their 30s and beyond."
"24763518","Bilateral Vestibular Deficiency: Quality of Life and Economic Implications.","IMPORTANCE: Bilateral vestibular deficiency (BVD) causes chronic imbalance and unsteady vision and greatly increases the risk of falls; however, its effects on quality of life and economic impact are not well defined.OBJECTIVE: To quantify disease-specific and health-related quality of life, health care utilization, and economic impact on individuals with BVD in comparison with those with unilateral vestibular deficiency (UVD).DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional survey study of patients with BVD or UVD and healthy controls at an academic medical center. Vestibular dysfunction was diagnosed by means of caloric nystagmography.INTERVENTIONS: Survey questionnaire.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Health status was measured using the Dizziness Handicap Index (DHI) and Health Utility Index Mark 3 (HUI3). Economic burden was estimated using participant responses to questions on disease-specific health care utilization and lost productivity.RESULTS: Fifteen patients with BVD, 22 with UVD, and 23 healthy controls participated. In comparison with patients with UVD and controls, patients with BVD had significantly worse DHI (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.001) and HUI3 scores. Statistically significant between-group differences were observed for overall HUI3 score (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.001) and for specific attributes including vision, hearing, ambulation, emotion, and pain (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.001 for all). Generalized linear model analysis of clinical variables associated with HUI3 scores after adjustment for other variables (including sex, race, education, age, and frequency of dizziness-related outpatient clinic visits) showed that the presence of UVD (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.001) or BVD (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.001), increased dizziness-related emergency room visits (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.002), and increased dizziness-related missed work days (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.001) were independently associated with worse HUI3 scores. Patients with BVD and UVD incurred estimated mean (range) annual economic burdens of $13,019 ($0-$48,830) and $3531 ($0-$48,442) per patient, respectively.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Bilateral vestibular deficiency significantly decreases quality of life and imposes substantial economic burdens on individuals and society. These results underscore the limits of adaptation and compensation in BVD. Furthermore, they quantify the potential benefits of prosthetic restoration of vestibular function both to these individuals and to society."

Participants were 18years or older, hospitalised for at least 1 day and normally residing in Thai Binh province. Data on demographic and injury characteristics were collected during their hospital stay. Data on HRQoL, measured by the Health Utilities Index mark 3 (HUI3), were collected in the participants' home at 1, 2, 4 and 12months after their hospital discharge. Generalised estimating equation model was selected to examine the association of demographic and injury characteristics with HRQoL which were repeatedly measured over time.RESULTS: HUI3 multi-attribute score was lowest at the first follow-up (0.52 for males, 0.28 for females). The scores significantly improved over time (increment of 0.08 or greater, p values<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). Ambulation and Pain were single-attributes with scores significantly increased over time (increment of 0.05 or greater, p values<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). Factors identified to be associated with lower HUI3 scores were older age (p values<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.02 or less), more severe injury (p values<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05 or less) and having other illnesses (p values<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01).CONCLUSION: The study provides important, and previously unreported, estimates of post-injury HRQoL in Vietnam.

The convenience sample was compared to an age-matched cross-sectional sample of the general US population (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>1266). The main outcome was QoL measured by the Ontario Health Utilities Index Mark III (HUI3).Loss of vestibular function with aging significantly decreases quality of life across multiple domains of well-being. These QoL reductions are responsible for heavy societal economic burdens of vestibular loss, which reveal potential benefits of prompt diagnosis and treatment of this condition.</AbstractText>: Loss of vestibular function with aging significantly decreases quality of life across multiple domains of well-being.

"29435802","Measuring health related quality of life (HRQoL) in community and facility-based care settings with the interRAI assessment instruments: development of a crosswalk to HUI3.","BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measures are of interest because they can be used to describe health of populations and represent a broader health outcome for population health analyses than mortality rates or life expectancy. The most widely used measure of HRQoL for deriving estimates of health-adjusted life expectancy is the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3). The HUI3 is available in most national surveys administered by Statistics Canada, and has been used as part of a microsimulation model to examine the impact of neurological conditions over the life course. Persons receiving home care and nursing home services are often not well-represented in these surveys; however, interRAI assessment instruments are now used as part of normal clinical practice in these settings for nine Canadian provinces/territories. Building on previous research that developed a HUI2 crosswalk for the interRAI assessments, the present study examined a new interRAI HRQoL index crosswalked to the HUI3.METHODS: interRAI and survey data were used to examine the distributional properties of global and domain-specific interRAI HRQoL and HUI3 index scores, respectively. Three populations were considered: well-elderly persons not receiving home care, home care clients and nursing home residents.RESULTS: The mean HUI3 and interRAI HRQoL index global scores declined from independent healthy older persons to home care clients, followed by nursing home residents. For the home care and nursing home populations, the interRAI HRQoL global estimates tended to be lower than HUI3 global scores obtained from survey respondents. While there were some statistically significant age, sex and diagnostic group differences in global scores and within attributes, the most notable differences were between populations from different care settings.DISCUSSION: The present study provides strong evidence for the validity of the interRAI HRQoL based on comparisons of distributional properties with those obtained with survey data based on the HUI3. The results demonstrate the importance of admission criteria for home care and nursing home settings, where function plays a more important role than demographic or diagnostic criteria. The interRAI HRQoL has a distinct advantage because it is gathered as part of normal clinical practice in care settings where interRAI instruments are mandatory and are used to assess all eligible persons in those sectors. In particular, those with severe cognitive and functional impairments (who tend to be under-represented in survey data) will be evaluated using the interRAI tools. Future research should build on this work by providing direct, person-level comparisons of interRAI HRQoL index and HUI3 scores, as well as longitudinal analyses to examine responsiveness to change."
