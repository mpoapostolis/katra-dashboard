"11025833","Efficacy of 3 commonly used hearing aid circuits: A crossover trial. NIDCD/VA Hearing Aid Clinical Trial Group.","CONTEXT: Numerous studies have demonstrated that hearing aids provide significant benefit for a wide range of sensorineural hearing loss, but no carefully controlled, multicenter clinical trials comparing hearing aid efficacy have been conducted.OBJECTIVE: To compare the benefits provided to patients with sensorineural hearing loss by 3 commonly used hearing aid circuits.DESIGN: Double-blind, 3-period, 3-treatment crossover trial conducted from May 1996 to February 1998.SETTING: Eight audiology laboratories at Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers across the United States.PATIENTS: A sample of 360 patients with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (mean age, 67.2 years; 57% male; 78.6% white).INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 sequences of linear peak clipper (PC), compression limiter (CL), and wide dynamic range compressor (WDRC) hearing aid circuits. All patients wore each of the 3 hearing aids, which were installed in identical casements, for 3 months.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of tests of speech recognition, sound quality, and subjective hearing aid benefit, administered at baseline and after each 3-month intervention with and without a hearing aid. At the end of the experiment, patients ranked the 3 hearing aid circuits.RESULTS: Each circuit markedly improved speech recognition, with greater improvement observed for soft and conversationally loud speech (all 52-dB and 62-dB conditions, P&lt;/=.001). All 3 circuits significantly reduced the frequency of problems encountered in verbal communication. Some test results suggested that CL and WDRC circuits provided a significantly better listening experience than PC circuits in word recognition (P =.002), loudness (P =.003), overall liking (P =.001), aversiveness of environmental sounds (P =.02), and distortion (P =.02). In the rank-order ratings, patients preferred the CL hearing aid circuits more frequently (41.6%) than the WDRC (29.8%) and the PC (28.6%) (P =.001 for CL vs both WDRC and PC).CONCLUSIONS: Each circuit provided significant benefit in quiet and noisy listening situations. The CL and WDRC circuits appeared to provide superior benefits compared with the PC, although the differences between them were much less than the differences between the aided vs unaided conditions.

"11019588","[Assessment of the psychological stress experienced before and after the use of a hearing aid in elderly patients].","Hearing aids are useful instruments for elderly patients with impaired hearing. However, the psychological effects of wearing a hearing aid have remained unclear until recently. A study was therefore performed at the Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital to determine such effects. Eighteen out of 50 questions included in the &quot;Psychological Stress Response Scale (PSRS)&quot; were selected and used to produce a questionnaire. The questionnaire was then given to and completed by 31 elderly patients who received and willingly used hearing aids. Of these patients, 20 were female and 11 were male. Their average age was 80.4 years (+/- 5.3 years ranging from 66-89 years). The questionnaire was completed by each patient on two separate occasions: before the hearing aids were fitted and after. In addition to the PSRS questionnaires, a second &quot;hearing satisfaction&quot; questionnaire was also completed, both before and after the hearing aids were fitted. The scores for depression, anxiety and anger were significantly lower after the hearing aid had been fitted. The score for depression showed a particularly distinctive decrease. The statistics also showed that the use of a hearing aid produced a significant improvement in the level of satisfaction patient's felt regarding their hearing. We conclude that the use of hearing aids by elderly patients not only alleviates their dissatisfaction with being unable to hear, but has additional psychological advantages. These results suggest that the use of a hearing aid not only improves hearing but may also delay or offset the development of dementia. Accordingly, suitable hearing aids should be provided to elderly patients so that they may recover their hearing and benefit from the associated psychological advantages."
"11527040","An investigation of the applicability of the inventory, satisfaction with amplification in daily life, at 2 weeks post hearing aid fitting.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the applicability of the self-report inventory, Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life (SADL), at 2 wk postfitting.DESIGN: The SADL was completed by two groups of hearing aid users, one fitted 2 wk before completion, the other at least 1 yr before. All SADLs were completed as a paper and pencil exercise, without involvement of an audiologist or other clinic staff. All the aid users were Government funded, all were fitted with the same model hearing aid, all were over the age of 60 yr, and all were fitted and counselled by the same two audiologists. Comparisons were made of the two groups' scores on each subscale and Global score, as well as on scores for each individual question.RESULTS: All scores for subscales, Global score, and individual questions were higher at 2 wk postfitting than at 1 yr. Significant differences were found for subscales Positive Effect (p &lt; 0.05), Service and Cost (p &lt; 0.025), Negative Features (p &lt; 0.001), as well as for the Global score (p &lt; 0.001). The only subscale not resulting in a significant difference was Personal Image (p &gt; 0.10). It was noted that Negative Features, such as background interference, acoustic feedback, and problems with telephone use, apparently take longer to be observed than Positive Effects such as improved communication and good sound quality. By contrast with some other reported studies, these results all display a reduction in self-reported outcome, rather than stability, or even improvement, over time. Among other possibilities, this finding may suggest the SADL measures something different to that measured by other inventories.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this investigation suggest that, if the aim is to predict long-term satisfaction with aid fitting, 2 wk postfitting is too early for meaningful application of the SADL as an outcome measure. It is possible that an earlier stability in SADL scores might be obtained by inclusion of additional questions aimed at earlier detection of negative features. Such inclusions may detract from one of the SADL's advantages, namely its brevity. It also is suggested that the long-term value of self-report methods will depend on development of rigorous and scientifically acceptable administration procedures, including appropriate times for application."
"11324843","Using conjoint analysis to examine the importance of hearing aid attributes.","OBJECTIVE: To introduce conjoint analysis (CA) as a method to explain choice decisions of hearing aid users and to measure the contributions of different hearing aid attributes involved.DESIGN: The study was conducted using CA, a method that is well established in marketing, but has not been used for hearing aid research. CA examines the contributions (importance) various attributes make to overall preference judgements. It is based on the premises that objects (i.e., hearing aids) can be described as different combinations of several attributes. The relative importance of the attributes is estimated from integral judgements of hypothetical hearing aids. The advantages of CA are a more realistic presentation of complete products instead of isolated attributes and the consideration of trade-offs between the features. The following attributes selected from 12 features in a prestudy were included in the application: speech perception in quiet, speech perception in noise, handling, sound quality, localization, and feedback. 93 randomly chosen experienced hearing aid wearers participated in the survey.RESULTS: It was found that the attributes concerning speech perception were by far most important. Speech discrimination in quiet and in noise were almost equally significant and contributed with 56% to the preference decisions of the subjects. The remaining attributes showed values in the range of 10% to 12%. When comparing various subgroups dependent on age, sex, hearing loss, satisfaction, etc., significant differences concerning the preferences were found. Elder and female subjects attached greater importance of the attribute &quot;handling&quot; whereas younger patients judged &quot;speech in noise&quot; more important. In general, subjects with greater hearing loss considered speech intelligibility in quiet to be more important than in noisy surroundings. Moreover, sound quality seems to be a significant indicator for satisfaction with the hearing aid.CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes CA as a survey technique to examine individual preferences for hearing aids. Several assumptions about the importance of hearing aid features for different groups of users could be confirmed quantitatively. Segmentation showed valid results depending on socio-demographic and user-specific parameters. The method used and the results are of interest for audiologists as well as the hearing aid industry. They provide valuable tools for future hearing aid design and should be considered in the development of self-assessment inventories."
"11296940","Clinical study of hearing instruments: a cross-sectional longitudinal audit based on consumer experiences.","The objective of the present audit was to document improvements/changes in hearing instrument (HI) benefit in terms of use and satisfaction throughout the 1990s and compare the benefit in consumers fitted with analogue (A), programmable (P), and digital signal processing (DSP) HIs. The audit data are based on a questionnaire mailed to subjects fitted with HIs 3 to 4 months after the fitting, including questions concerning satisfaction with the HI, use of the HI, ability to manage the HI, and satisfaction with the overall services in the department. Information was obtained from 32,694 subjects (i.e., 71.2 per cent of those fitted with HIs throughout the last decade), with a median age at fitting of 78 years (range, 18-102), with a preponderance of females. No significant differences in age, gender distribution, and hearing instrument distribution were found between the respondents and non-respondents. The audit shows that there are no significant differences in any of the benefit parameters throughout the decade, irrespective of the introduction of P-HIs in 1995 and of the DSP-HIs in 1998. Thus, from the consumers' perspective, no changes have appeared in the last decade. A comparative analysis of the A-HIs, P-HIs, and DSP-HIs shows that among those provided with P-HIs and DSP-HIs, only 69.6 per cent (CI 68.1-71.0) and 65.5 per cent (CI 60.2-78.8), respectively, were very satisfied/satisfied with the HI, which is significantly less than the 73.5 per cent (CI 72.4-74.5) in those fitted with A-HIs. The daily/weekly use of all three types of HIs was similar. However, the group fitted with DSP-HIs was significantly less satisfied with the general services compared with those fitted with A-HIs and P-HIs, respectively. Based on these audit data, it is concluded that, according to the consumers, the outcome from HIs has not changed over the last decade, and a comparison between the traditional A-HIs with both P-HIs and DSP-HIs is in favour of the traditional A-HIs."
"11293315","[Users' experiences with modern hearing aids. An audit].","INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to evaluate satisfaction with use and manipulation of hearing aids (HA), and to compare these parameters for analogue (A-HA), programmable (P-HA), and digital signal processing aids (DSP-HA).METHOD: An audit was made of data on users' experiences, as indicated in a questionnaire posted 3-4 months after the HA fitting.MATERIAL: Questionnaires were posted to 18,702 persons, who, during the period 1997-1999, had been provided with a HA at a median age of 77 years (range 18-98), 41.8% of whom were men, and 58.2% women. Responses were returned by 12,866 (68.8%), and, as there were no differences between the respondents and non-respondents with respect to age, gender, and distribution of HA type, the responses were considered representative.RESULTS: According to the replies, 71.5% were very satisfied/satisfied with their HA; 89% used the instrument daily/weekly, and 75% were able to manipulate the HA without problems. However, 10.7-12.7% said they never used the fitted HA. A significantly higher proportion were satisfied with A-HAs as compared to P-HAs and DSP-HAs, whereas there was no significant difference in use as a function of type. A significantly higher number of the users fitted with a DSP-HA could manipulate them, but 36.5% of these needed follow-up in contrast to 25.5% fitted with a P-HA, and 21.6% fitted with an A-HA. A significantly smaller proportion of the elderly were able to manipulate the HA.CONCLUSION: The users of modern HAs are satisfied with them, use them, and most are able to manipulate the HA without problems. The new technology has raised unrealistic expectations in the users, and the DSP-HAs account for larger costs to the national health services, because they are more expensive and the need for staff resources is greater."
"11214976","Clinical application of the SADL scale in private practice II: predictive validity of fitting variables. Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life.","Predictive validity of 44 independent variables and their interactions with Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life (SADL) scores was assessed. SADL scores were influenced by patient age, years of hearing aid experience, hours of use per day, perceived hearing difficulty, pure-tone average, hearing aid style, processor type, and manufacturer's invoice cost. The relative importance of these variables to SADL measures was complex and very small, but the variables and their squares and interactions improved r2 predictions of SADL Global and subscale scores in a separate stepwise multiple linear regression procedure by 12 to 33 percent compared to SADL norms alone. More research with additional variables is needed to develop a clinically useful model for predicting wearer satisfaction. Clinically, SADL scores yield subscale-specific patterns of satisfaction and dissatisfaction that help in intervention planning and serve as graphic &quot;snapshots&quot; of satisfaction status. A series of patient profiles are presented illustrating the potential usefulness of the SADL in predicting hearing aid satisfaction. With its good construct and psychometric properties, the SADL could serve as a gold standard for satisfaction outcomes and a basis for development of a predictive model of hearing aid fitting success."
"12477172","Opting for two hearing aids: a predictor of long-term use among adult patients fitted after screening.","This study is a follow-up of patients fitted with one or two hearing aids, approximately 10 years previously. Our patients were identified through population screening for hearing difficulties when they were aged 50-65 years. At the time, they had a trial of unilateral and bilateral fittings, and then they made their own choice to keep one or two aids. We found that 10 of the 12 who had opted for two aids and were available for follow-up 10 years later continued using at least one aid (83%, 95% CI 55-95). Six of the 17 who opted for unilateral fitting and were available for follow-up used a hearing aid in the long term (35%, 95% CI: 17-59%). Therefore, this study suggests that people who are identified through population screening, are bilaterally impaired, are willing to try bilateral fitting, and choose to continue with two aids, are likely to become long-term users of (one or two) hearing aids. Those who choose to continue with one aid after a trial of bilateral fitting are at high risk of rejecting the aid in the long term. Our sample is small, and we took a number of steps in the analysis in order to clarify whether these findings are reliable. We could not identify any confounding factors. The patients' preference for continuing with bilateral or unilateral aids after fitting was the only predictor of long-term use in our sample. Remarkably, bilateral preference was a better predictor of long-term use than the degree of hearing impairment. We discuss how this study provides useful information for planning population screening for hearing difficulties in middle age."
"12391946","Development of a questionnaire to measure hearing-related health state preferences framed in an overall health perspective.","OBJECTIVES: The objective was to develop the Audiological Disabilities Preference Index (ADPI), a measure to determine health state preferences associated with audiological disabilities. The ADPI consists of a hearing-related health state description, hearing-related health state valuation, and transformation of the latter to the overall health scale. Research questions were: a) to determine the feasibility of ADPI in an older hearing-impaired population; b) to assess gain in health state preference after hearing aid fitting; c) to evaluate the reliability of ADPI using hypothetical health states; and d) to compare the results of ADPI with the EuroQol.METHODS: The ADPI, the marker states, and the EuroQol were administered to 78 first-time hearing aid users before and 12 and 25 weeks after hearing aid fitting.RESULTS: The ADPI was feasible in an older hearing-impaired population (mean age, 69.1 years). After hearing aid fitting, all dimensions of audiological disability improved (p &lt; .001). Change in hearing-specific health state and the latter framed in overall health were 0.27 and 0.12, respectively (p &lt; .001). The mean values of the marker states were stable, but the intraclass correlation coefficients were low. Correlations between ADPI and hearing loss and the EuroQol, respectively, were low, while moderate with hearing aid satisfaction. There was a slight change on the EuroQol visual analog scale, with only an improvement in the feeling dimension (p &lt; .05).CONCLUSIONS: The ADPI provides a practical and useful method to assess hearing-related health state preferences needed for clinical decision making and cost-effectiveness analysis."
"12170145","Determining the importance of fundamental hearing aid attributes.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the importance of fundamental hearing aid attributes and to elicit measures of satisfaction and dissatisfaction.STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study based on a survey using a decompositional approach of preference measurement (conjoint analysis).SETTING: Ear, nose, and throat university hospitals in Cologne and Giessen; various branches of hearing aid dispensers.PATIENTS: A random sample of 175 experienced hearing aid users aged 20 to 91 years (mean age, 61 yr) recruited at two different sites.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Relative importance of different hearing aid attributes, satisfaction and dissatisfaction with hearing aid attributes.RESULTS: Of the six fundamental hearing aid attributes assessed by the hearing aid users, the two features concerning speech perception attained the highest relative importance (25% speech in quiet, 27% speech in noise). The remaining four attributes (sound quality, handling, feedback, localization) had significantly lower values in a narrow range of 10 to 12%. Comparison of different subgroups of hearing aid wearers based on sociodemographic and user-specific data revealed a large interindividual scatter of the preferences for the attributes. A similar examination with 25 clinicians revealed overestimation of the importance of the attributes commonly associated with problems. Moreover, examination of satisfaction showed that speech in noise was the most frequent source of dissatisfaction (30% of all statements), whereas the subjects were satisfied with speech in quiet.CONCLUSIONS: The results emphasize the high importance of attributes related to speech perception. Speech discrimination in noise was the most important but also the most frequent source of negative statements. This attribute will be the outstanding parameter of future developments. Appropriate handling becomes an important factor for elderly subjects. However, because of the large interindividual scatter of data, the preferences of different hearing aid users were hardly predictable, giving evidence of multifactorial influences."
"11808724","Personal and social conditions potentially influencing women's hearing loss management.","Little gender-specific data related to hearing loss and hearing loss management are available. The purpose of this investigation was to examine personal and social conditions affecting women at selected stages of the adult life course that may influence hearing loss management. In all, 191 women in three age groups, ranging from 35 to 85 years old, participated. None reported hearing problems. Participants completed a demographic data form and were given a standard audiometric evaluation to confirm age-normal hearing. Each completed assessments of speech understanding in quiet and noise, auditory signal duration discrimination, and binaural processing. Measures of hearing knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes; health-related locus of control; ego strength; and, social support were administered. Results revealed that although some variables deteriorate among subsequent age groups (i.e., hearing thresholds, central auditory processing, and ego strength), the reverse is true for others (i.e., social interaction and satisfaction with income). Age-specific sociodemographic burdens that may interfere with hearing loss management were noted. New psychosocial data are revealed against which women and men with impaired hearing may be compared."
"11758306","Dynamic modeling in medical technology assessment. Fitting hearing aids in The Netherlands.","OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this article is to demonstrate the usefulness of dynamic modeling for an economic assessment of technology in health care. Specifically, this approach is applied to assess the impact of the use of hearing aids in Dutch health care.METHODS: The population is divided into different health classes between which, over time, transitions occur. Transition probabilities are derived from exogenous data. The transitions are associated with economic and societal costs and benefits. People who are satisfied with their hearing aids experience benefits. These benefits are expressed by quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs are made during transitions (mainly the fitting of hearing aids). A cohort analysis is carried out, starting with people in a particular age group. The starting point is a fixed number of people within this age group, who are followed during their whole lifetime.RESULTS: Costs per QALY ratios are calculated for two health programs. The Fitting Hearing Aid Program describes the present situation in the Netherlands; the Post-purchase Counseling Hearing Aid Program is a hypothetical addition to the first program, where an intervention based on a Dutch study is undertaken to improve satisfaction with hearing aids. Future benefits and costs are discounted at a rate of 5%.CONCLUSIONS: The dynamic modeling approach provides a more realistic picture than a static approach. Particularly, the cost-effectiveness of the Fitting Hearing Aid Program is compared with the Post-purchase Counseling Hearing Aid Program."
"14658856","Expectations about hearing aids: demographic and audiological predictors.","The Expected Consequences of Hearing Aid Ownership inventory (ECHO) is a 14-item questionnaire for measuring expectations about hearing aids. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the ECHO questionnaire used in the Danish National Hearing Health Service in terms of reliability and validity; to use the inventory to assess the patients' pre-fitting expectations in different domains, to gain information on possible predictors for the magnitude of expectations, and to evaluate whether first-time users had realistic expectations. The questionnaire was administered to 805 consecutive patients, and responses were received from 47.7%, representative for the population examined in the department. The median age was 74.1 years, with an even distribution of males and females, and a median better-ear pure-tone average (0.5-4 kHz) of 41.3 dB HL. The results showed that the questionnaire had acceptable reliability and validity when the original subscales were rearranged. The pre-fitting expectations with regard to the positive effect of amplification and different aspects related to the hearing aid and service were, overall, very high. Age and hearing status were predictors of the magnitude of expectations related to the hearing aid and the service. In first-time users, unrealistic positive expectations were found with regard to potentially negative features of hearing aids."
"14582640","Examination of differences between successful and unsuccessful elderly hearing aid candidates matched for age, hearing loss and gender.","This study examined group differences on a variety of measures for three groups of elderly hearing aid candidates matched for gender, age and hearing loss. These three groups were: (1) 26 candidates who declined amplification (non-adherents); (2) 24 individuals who purchased hearing aids, but subsequently returned them (rejected HA); and (3) 26 who purchased hearing aids and continued to use their hearing aids for at least the first 6 months following delivery (accepted HA). Following demonstration of adequate reliability for these measures, using the non-adherents as the test retest study sample, group differences were examined for each pre-fit measure. The group of non-adherents who declined amplification differed from the two groups who purchased hearing aids on their scores for the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE) and for several scales of the Communication Profile for the Hearing Impaired (CPHI) that assessed the individual's personal adjustment to hearing impairment. These findings were generally confirmed for the individual data, with the use of discriminant analysis. For the two groups who tried hearing aids, there were no group differences between those who retained them and those who did not. Discriminant analysis, however, indicated that those in the group who retained their (linear) hearing aids tended to have better finger dexterity and higher loudness discomfort levels than those who did not."
"12918634","Beyond hearing aid fitting: improving communication for older adults.","Many older adults with hearing impairment continue to have substantial communication difficulties after being fitted with hearing aids, and many do not choose to wear hearing aids. Two group communication education programs aimed at such older people are described. The 'Keep on Talking' program has a health promotion focus, and is aimed at maintaining communication for older adults living in the community. An experimental group (n = 120) attended the program, and a control group (n = 130) received a communication assessment but no intervention. Significant improvements were found in the experimental participants in terms of knowledge about communication changes with age and about strategies to maintain communication skills. At the follow-up evaluation at 1 year, 45% of the experimental group, compared to 10% of the control group, had acted to improve their communication skills. The 'Active Communication Education' program focuses on the development of problem-solving strategies to improve communication in everyday life situations. Preliminary outcomes have been assessed on a small scale (n = 14) to date. It is concluded that communication programs represent an important adjunct to, or supplement for, the traditional approach that focuses on hearing aid fitting."
"12918630","Demands on hearing aid features--special signal processing for elderly users?","Age-related effects on several parameters of hearing aid provision, comprising the importance of various hearing aid attributes, the main reason for dissatisfaction, and a measure for aided performance, were examined. When comparing two subgroups of younger and elderly hearing aid users, a significant difference occurred for the importance of the attribute 'handling', whereas all other features examined showed only differences in trends. The question posed for the main reason for dissatisfaction with the hearing aids revealed no significant contrasts. Problems with the instruments in several listening situations were investigated by means of the Gothenburg Profile. Items related to communication in groups showed significant differences between younger and older subjects, but only non-significant contrasts remained when the mean hearing losses of the two subgroups were properly matched. Based on the data presented, some age-related concerns should be taken into account in hearing-aid provision for elderly users, but special signal processing does not seem to be necessary."
"12701750","The hearing aid revolution: fact or fiction?","OBJECTIVE: To present the experiences of consumers with traditional hearing aids (T-HAs) and digital signal processing hearing aids (DSP-HAs) during the period 1999-2001, based on data obtained from an ongoing quality assurance programme.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A questionnaire is mailed to subjects fitted with HAs 3-4 months after the fitting, and includes questions concerning satisfaction with the HA, frequency of use of the HA, ability to manipulate the HA, satisfaction with the overall services of the department and need (if any) for additional appointments.RESULTS: The response rate was 69.5%, and thus information was obtained from 14 325 subjects (44.9% male, 55.1% female; median age 72 years; range 18-97 years). Of the respondents, 7,983 (55.7%) had been provided with T-HAs and 6,342 (44.3%) with DSP-HAs. The results of the questionnaire were as follows: 71.4% of those fitted with a T-HA were very satisfied/satisfied with it, compared to 68.1% with a DSP-HA (p &lt; 0.05); 91.6% and 89.1%, respectively used their HA daily/weekly (p &lt; 0.05); 80.5% and 82.2%, respectively, were able to manipulate their HA; 96.2% and 97.3%, respectively were satisfied with the overall services of the department; and 32.5% and 48.5%, respectively, indicated a need for an additional appointment (p &lt; 0.05). A comparison between high- and low-cost DSP-HAs showed that 68.4% and 68.2%, respectively were very satisfied/satisfied with their HA (p = NS).CONCLUSIONS: According to consumers the &quot;HA revolution&quot; has failed to materialize; the significantly higher proportion of subjects with DSP-HAs who need an additional appointment represents a heavy burden on the hearing health services. The lack of a difference between the benefits obtained with low- and high-cost DSP-HAs emphasizes the need for appropriately designed and performed trials before new HA technology is launched."
"15592858","Detecting components of hearing aid fitting using a self-assessment-inventory.","The evaluation of hearing-aid fitting includes numerous assessments such as electro- and psychoacoustic tests. The subjective estimation of the hearing aid user can be elicited with self-assessment inventories encompassing various parameters, e.g., benefit, satisfaction and usage. A questionnaire comprising 11 domains (disability, handicap, frequency and significance of the listening situation, importance of the hearing aid, expectation, demand, aided performance, benefit, satisfaction and usage) within three different conditions (speech in quiet and in noise and listening to sounds) was used to detect components underlying hearing aid fitting. The data show a three-factor structure (situation-, restriction- and aid-related variables) independent from the conditions. Usage depends on all of the three factors. Disability and handicap reveal the highest values for speech in noise, whereas the aid-related factor shows the lowest values for this condition. Global satisfaction with the hearing aid is significantly correlated with the aid-related factor, but independent from the restriction of hearing. The aid-related factor is positively influenced by the amount of social activity because more active persons report higher benefit and satisfaction for all listening conditions. Age does not exhibit a significant relationship to one of the components. Basically, all correlation coefficients are only intermediate, revealing that inter-individual differences of the patients are rather high. The data indicate that extra-audiological factors might also play an important role in the success of hearing aid fitting."
"15506496","Predicting success with hearing aids in everyday living.","Persons with impaired hearing who are candidates for amplification are not all equally successful with hearing aids in daily living. Having the ability to predict success with amplification in everyday life from measures that can be obtained during an initial evaluation of the patient's candidacy would result in greater patient satisfaction with hearing aids and more efficient use of clinical resources. This study investigated the relationship between various demographic and audiometric measures, and two measures of hearing aid success in 50 hearing aid wearers. Audiometric predictors included measures of audibility and suprathreshold distortion. The unaided and aided signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss on the QuickSIN test provided the best predictors of hearing aid success in daily living. However, much of this predictive relationship appeared attributable to the patient's age."
"15239204","Analysis of prefitting versus postfitting hearing aid orientation using the Glasgow Hearing Aid Benefit Profile (GHABP).","Results of this study demonstrate the advantages of both pre- and postfitting hearing aid orientation (HAO) sessions. This study demonstrated that HAO counseling is helpful in expediting hearing aid benefit and satisfaction through the education of our clients and that this benefit and satisfaction is age dependent as measured by the Glasgow Hearing Aid Benefit Profile (GHABP) (Gatehouse, 1997). Patients with greater initial disability, as identified by item 1 of the GHABP, receive significant benefit from prefitting and/or postfitting counseling as compared to patients receiving no counseling. Implications of these findings are discussed."
"15224866","Clinical trial of a low-cost, solar-powered hearing aid.","OBJECTIVE: In July 2001 the World Health Organization (WHO) launched their &quot;Guidelines for hearing aids and services for developing countries&quot;. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of an analogue, low-cost, behind-the-ear hearing aid (BTE-HA) that met the minimum technical requirements outlined by the WHO.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 25 subjects (17 males, 8 females; median age 74 years; range 50-86 years) were recruited among patients referred for audiological evaluation who consented to participate in the trial. All subjects had a hearing loss of &lt; or = 60 dB HL at 2 kHz, were mobile and mentally unimpaired; 13 were experienced users of HAs, 3 suffered from mixed conductive/sensorineural hearing impairment (HI) and the remainder had pure sensorineural HI. Based on pure-tone, speech and impedance audiometry the BTE-HAs were fitted, using the National Acoustic Laboratories-R (NAL-R) prescription rule, 21 binaurally and 4 monaurally. All fittings were validated by insertion gain measurements, and the immediate benefit was measured by means of the speech recognition score in background noise (SRSN; signal:noise ratio = 10 dB) without and with the HA. After a 6-week trial period a structured interview based on the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HAs) was performed.RESULTS: The results showed that the amplification of the HA deviated significantly from the NAL-R target at all frequencies, giving significantly more amplification at 500 and 1000 Hz despite maximum bass-cut, whenever relevant, and significantly less amplification as required at 2, 3 and 4 kHz. The median SRSN without HA was 48% (range 0-96%), which improved significantly to 80% (range 24-100%) with HA. The median individual difference in SRSN without and with HA was 20% (range 0-72%). The total IOI-HA score with the test HA was 4.1 (range 2.6-4.6), showing that it offered subjectively high satisfaction and reduction in limitations of activity.CONCLUSIONS: The low-cost HA: (i) provides benefit to the hearing-impaired person; (ii) offers poor amplification in the high frequencies; and (iii) gives subjective satisfaction similar to that for modern available HAs."
"15004647","Modeling and predicting hearing aid outcome.","Following a brief tutorial on the application of factor analysis to hearing aid outcome measures, three studies of hearing aid outcome measures in elderly adults are presented and analyzed. Two of the studies were completed at Indiana University (IU-1 and IU-2), and one was a collaborative multisite study by the Veterans Administration and the National Institute of Deafness and other Communication Disorders (NIDCD/VA). IU-1 measured hearing aid outcome in 173 elderly wearers of single-channel, linear, in-the-ear hearing aids with output-limiting compression, whereas IU-2 obtained the same extensive set of outcome measures from 53 elderly wearers of two-channel, wide-dynamic-range compression, in-the-canal hearing aids. In the NIDCD/VA study, 333 to 338 participants wore three single-channel circuits in succession, with each circuit housed within an in-the-ear shell. The three circuits included in that study and in this analysis were: (1) linear with peak clipping, (2) linear with output-limiting compression, and (3) single-channel, wide-dynamic-range compression. Evaluation of the many outcome measures completed in each study using principal components factor analysis revealed that from three (both IU studies) to five (NIDCD/VA study) principal components captured the individual differences in hearing aid outcome. This was independent of hearing aid type (in-the-ear or in-the-canal) and circuitry. Subsequent multiple regression analyses of individual differences in performance along each dimension of hearing aid outcome revealed that these individual differences could be accounted for reasonably well by various prefit variables for some dimensions of outcome, but not others. In general, measures of speech recognition performance were well accounted for by prefit measures, with the best predictors being hearing loss, cognitive performance, and age. Measures of hearing aid usage were less well accounted for by prefit measures, with the most accurate predictor of current hearing aid use being prior hearing aid use. The outcome dimension accounted for most poorly was that associated with hearing aid satisfaction, with subjective measures of aided sound quality being the best predictor of performance along this dimension of hearing aid outcome. Additional multicenter, large-scale studies are needed to develop more complete models of hearing aid outcome and to identify the variables that influence various aspects of hearing aid outcome. It is only through this additional research that it will be possible to optimize outcome for hearing aid wearers."
"16377990","Hearing aid patients in private practice and public health (Veterans Affairs) clinics: are they different?","OBJECTIVE: In hearing aid research, it is commonplace to combine data across subjects whose hearing aids were provided in different service delivery models. There is reason to question whether these types of patients are always similar enough to justify this practice. To explore this matter, this investigation evaluated similarities and differences in self-report data obtained from hearing aid patients derived from public health (Veterans Affairs, VA) and private practice (PP) settings.DESIGN: The study was a multisite, cross-sectional survey in which 230 hearing aid patients from VA and PP audiology clinic settings provided self-report data on a collection of questionnaires both before and after the hearing aid fitting. Subjects were all older adults with mild to moderately severe hearing loss. About half of them had previous experience wearing hearing aids. All subjects were fitted with wide-dynamic-range-compression instruments and received similar treatment protocols.RESULTS: Numerous statistically significant differences were observed between the VA and PP subject groups. Before the fitting, VA patients reported higher expectations from the hearing aids and more severe unaided problems compared with PP patients with similar audiograms. Three wks after the fitting, VA patients reported more satisfaction with their hearing aids. On some measures VA patients reported more benefit, but different measures of benefit did not give completely consistent results. Both groups reported using the hearing aids an average of approximately 8 hrs per day. VA patients reported age-normal physical and mental health, but PP patients tended to report better than typical health for their age group.CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that hearing aid patients seen in the VA public health hearing services are systematically different in self-report domains from those seen in private practice services. It is therefore risky to casually combine data from these two types of subjects or to generalize research results from one group to the other. Further, compared with PP patients, VA patients consistently reported more favorable hearing aid fitting outcomes. Additional study is indicated to explore the determinants of this result and its generalizability to other public health service delivery systems such as those in other countries. Moreover, efforts should be made to assess the potential for transferring positive elements from the VA system to the PP service delivery system, if possible."
"16180973","Recognition of hearing aid orientation content by first-time users.","PURPOSE: To examine how well hearing aid orientation (HAO) content is remembered immediately and 1 month after the HAO, and whether the ability to remember this information differs as a function of the audiologist providing the information, patient's age, degree of hearing loss, and prior knowledge of hearing aids.METHOD: A convenience sample of 100 older adults completed a multiple-choice test of hearing aid knowledge immediately following the HAO and 1 month later. Covariate and regression analyses were used to address the study purpose.RESULTS: On average, participants recognized 74% of the information immediately following HAO and 78% at 1 month. Hearing loss was associated with declining recognition for hearing aid use and care information immediately following HAO, whereas prior knowledge was associated with successful recognition. Participants who recognized more HAO content immediately also remembered more at 1 month. A difference in recognition of hearing aid information based on audiologist was suggested immediately following HAO, but there were no differences at 1 month. Ability to recognize HAO content was not related to age of participants.CONCLUSIONS: On average, participants recognized approximately 75% of the HAO content, which is encouraging from a clinical standpoint, providing support for the efficacy of the HAO and the time audiologists spend in completing it. Moreover, recognition of HAO content improved when tested at 1 month, suggesting audiologists may expect their patients to be aware of a majority of hearing aid use and care information following the hearing aid trial period."
"16178409","Measuring hearing aid outcomes using the Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life (SADL) questionnaire: Australian data.","The aims of this study were to investigate hearing aid satisfaction for a group of older Australians fitted with government-funded hearing aids using the Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life (SADL) questionnaire; to compare the Australian data gathered with the provisional normative data reported by Cox and Alexander (1999); and to investigate the relationship between SADL satisfaction and several participant variables, hearing aid variables, and other outcome measures. The SADL questionnaire and a Client Satisfaction Survey (CSS) were distributed by mail to 1284 adults fitted with government-funded hearing aids three to six months previously. 1014 surveys were returned. The mean age of participants was 75.32 years; 54.4% of participants were male, and 54.8% were fitted binaurally. Participants were fitted primarily with digitally programmable hearing aids of various styles (22.5% BTEs, 34.8% ITEs, 41.8% ITCs, 0.9% nonstandard [NS] devices). Overall, participants reported a considerable level of satisfaction with their devices. SADL Global and subscale scores were significantly higher for the Australian sample than the U.S. norms described by Cox and Alexander (1999)."
"15724520","Self-reported outcomes of aural rehabilitation in a developing country.","The aim of this study was to evaluate self-reported outcomes among hearing aid users (age 16-89 years; mean 45.8 years) to determine the effectiveness of aural rehabilitation in Nigeria based on the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA). The responses were evaluated with descriptive statistics, factor analysis of the principal components and multiple regressions. Most respondents reported favorable outcomes in all domains of the inventory, comprising: daily use (mean 4.1; SD 1.2), benefits (mean 3.5; SD 1.1), residual activity limitation (mean 3.4; SD 1.2), satisfaction (mean 3.7; SD 1.2), residual participation restriction (mean 3.5; SD 1.3), impact on others (mean 3.4; SD 1.3) and changes in quality of life (mean 3.8; SD 1.0). The mean score distribution compared favorably with those reported in the developed world. There were significant intercorrelations among all items, and two factors (eigenvalue&gt;1) accounted for 68% of the underlying variance. Impact on others was the only domain associated with demographic/audiologic variables. The study showed that aural rehabilitation is feasible and effective in enhancing activity and participation for the hearing impaired in a developing country."
"16672792","The Performance-Perceptual Test (PPT) and its relationship to aided reported handicap and hearing aid satisfaction.","OBJECTIVE: Results of objective clinical tests (e.g., measures of speech understanding in noise) often conflict with subjective reports of hearing aid benefit and satisfaction. The Performance-Perceptual Test (PPT) is an outcome measure in which objective and subjective evaluations are made by using the same test materials, testing format, and unit of measurement (signal-to-noise ratio, S/N), permitting a direct comparison between measured and perceived ability to hear. Two variables are measured: a Performance Speech Reception Threshold in Noise (SRTN) for 50% correct performance and a Perceptual SRTN, which is the S/N at which listeners perceive that they can understand the speech material. A third variable is computed: the Performance-Perceptual Discrepancy (PPDIS); it is the difference between the Performance and Perceptual SRTNs and measures the extent to which listeners &quot;misjudge&quot; their hearing ability. Saunders et al. in 2004 examined the relation between PPT scores and unaided hearing handicap. In this publication, the relations between the PPT, residual aided handicap, and hearing aid satisfaction are described.DESIGN: Ninety-four individuals between the ages of 47 and 86 yr participated. All had symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss and had worn binaural hearing aids for at least 6 wk before participating. All subjects underwent routine audiological examination and completed the PPT, the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly/Adults (HHIE/A), and the Satisfaction for Amplification in Daily Life questionnaire. Sixty-five subjects attended one research visit for participation in this study, and 29 attended a second visit to complete the PPT a second time.RESULTS: Performance and Perceptual SRTN and PPDIS scores were normally distributed and showed excellent test-retest reliability. Aided SRTNs were significantly better than unaided SRTNs; aided and unaided PPDIS values did not differ. Stepwise multiple linear regression showed that the PPDIS, the Performance SRTN, and age were significant predictors of scores on the HHIE/A such that greater reported handicap is associated with underestimating hearing ability, poorer aided ability to understand speech in noise, and being younger. Scores on the Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life were not well explained by the PPT, age, or audiometric thresholds. When individuals were grouped by their HHIE/A scores, it was seen that individuals who report more handicap than expected based on their audiometric thresholds, have a more negative PPDIS, i.e., underestimate their hearing ability, relative to individuals who report expected handicap, who in turn have a more negative PPDIS than individuals who report less handicap than expected. No such patterns were apparent for the Performance SRTN.CONCLUSIONS: The study showed the PPT to be a reliable outcome measure that can provide more information than a performance measure and/or a questionnaire measure alone, in that the PPDIS can provide the clinician with an explanation for discrepant objective and subjective reports of hearing difficulties. The finding that self-reported handicap is affected independently by both actual ability to hear and the (mis)perception of ability to hear underscores the difficulty clinicians encounter when trying to interpret outcomes questionnaires. We suggest that this variable should be measured and taken into account when interpreting questionnaires and counseling patients."
"17445260","Potential barriers and facilitators for implementation of an integrated care pathway for hearing-impaired persons: an exploratory survey among patients and professionals.","BACKGROUND: Because of the increasing costs and anticipated shortage of Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) specialists in the care for hearing-impaired persons, an integrated care pathway that includes direct hearing aid provision was developed. While this direct pathway is still under investigation, in a survey we examined expectations and potential barriers and facilitators towards this direct pathway, of patients and professionals involved in the pathway.METHODS: Two study populations were assessed: members of the health professions involved in the care pathway for hearing-impaired persons (general practitioners (GPs), hearing aid dispensers, ENT-specialists and clinical audiologists) and persons with hearing complaints. We developed a comprehensive semi-structured questionnaire for the professionals, regarding expectations, barriers, facilitators and conditions for implementation. We developed two questionnaires for persons with hearing complaints, both regarding evaluations and preferences, and administered them after they had experienced two key elements of the direct pathway: the triage and the hearing aid fitting.RESULTS: On average GPs and hearing aid dispensers had positive expectations towards the direct pathway, while ENT-specialists and clinical audiologists had negative expectations. Professionals stated both barriers and facilitators towards the direct pathway. Most professionals either supported implementation of the direct pathway, provided that a number of conditions were satisfied, or did not support implementation, unless roughly the same conditions were satisfied. Professionals generally agreed on which conditions need to be satisfied. Persons with hearing complaints evaluated the present referral pathway and the new direct pathway equally. Many, especially older, participants stated however that they would still visit the GP and ENT-specialist, even when this would not be necessary for reimbursement of the hearing aid, and found it important that the ENT-specialist or Audiological Centre evaluated their hearing aid.CONCLUSION: This study identified professional concerns about the direct pathway for hearing-impaired persons. Gaps exist in expectations amongst professions. Also gaps exist between users of the pathway, especially between age groups and regions. Professionals are united in the conditions that need to be fulfilled for a successful implementation of the direct pathway. Implementation on a regional level is recommended to best satisfy these conditions."
"18664691","Candidacy for bilateral hearing aids: a retrospective multicenter study.","PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to find factors for refining candidacy criteria for bilateral hearing aid fittings. Clinical files of 1,000 consecutive hearing aid fittings were analyzed.METHOD: Case history, audiometric, and rehabilitation data were collected from clinical files, and an extensive questionnaire on long-term outcome measures was conducted. After at least 2 years of hearing aid use, 505 questionnaires were returned. In order to compare differences in benefits between unilateral and bilateral fittings, two subgroups were composed in which most relevant variables (age, degree of hearing loss, and audiometric asymmetry) were matched for unilateral fittings (n=212) and bilateral fittings (n=477).RESULTS: The bilateral group had significantly higher benefit scores than the unilateral group for detection, speech intelligibility in reverberation, and localization, but poorer scores for comfort of loud sounds. The benefit of bilateral hearing aids was not significantly related to the level of technology of the hearing aids.CONCLUSION: The analysis of the relation between objective parameters and the subjective outcome measures showed that candidacy for a successful bilateral fitting could not be predicted from age, maximum speech intelligibility, employment, exposure to background noise, or social activities."
"18567593","A multicenter trial of an assess-and-fit hearing aid service using open canal fittings and comply ear tips.","Large potential benefits have been suggested for an assess-and-fit approach to hearing health care, particularly using open canal fittings. However, the clinical effectiveness has not previously been evaluated, nor has the efficiency of this approach in a National Health Service setting. These two outcomes were measured in a variety of clinical settings in the United Kingdom. Twelve services in England and Wales participated, and 540 people with hearing problems, not previously referred for assessment, were included. Of these, 68% (n = 369) were suitable and had hearing aids fitted to NAL NL1 during the assess-and-fit visit using either open ear tips, or Comply ear tips. The Glasgow Hearing Aid Benefit Profile was used to compare patients fitted with open ear tips with a group of patients from the English Modernization of Hearing Aid Services evaluation, who used custom earmolds. This showed a significant improvement in outcome for those with open ear tips after allowing for age and hearing loss in the analysis. In particular, the benefits of using bilateral open ear tips were significantly larger than bilateral custom earmolds. This assess-and-fit model showed a mean service efficiency gain of about 5% to 10%. The actual gain will depend on current practice, in particular on the separate appointments used, the numbers of patients failing to attend appointments, and the numbers not accepting a hearing aid solution for their problem. There are potentially further efficiency and quality gains to be made if patients are appropriately triaged before referral."
"18540375","[Analyses of factors contributing to hearing aids use and both subjective and objective estimates of hearing].","The use of hearing aids, regardless actual implementation, may be interpreted as a cry for help in hearing difficulty. We assessed factors contributing to hearing aid possession and predicted needs of hearing assistance from the distribution of hearing level in self-estimated (subjective) hearing loss and hearing loss pointed out by others (objective) in a population-based aging cohort. Of 1192 men and 1163 women aged 40 to 84 years, the prevalence of hearing loss using the criteria of a mean hearing threshold&gt;25dB at frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz in the better ear was 23.6%. Hearing aids were possessed by 11.0% in the hearing loss group. Statistical analysis by gender was done to identify factors associated with hearing aid possession using stepwise multiple regression in which independent variables were age, hearing in the better and worse ear, and items from response to a questionnaire on self-estimated hearing loss, hearing loss pointed out by others, job, household income, financial satisfaction, education, housemate, how often others were talked to and how often those surveyed went out. Age, better-ear hearing, worse-ear hearing, and education statistically influenced hearing aid possession in men, and age, better-ear hearing, and hearing loss pointed out by others statistically influenced women. Age had a negative effect on hearing aid possession in both men and women, indicating that possession decreased with aging. Scattergrams were plotted with worse-ear hearing on the y axis and better-ear hearing on the x axis for 4 groups of respondents divided into groups with self-estimated hearing loss or hearing loss pointed out by others: (1) no subjective and objective hearing loss, (2) subjective but no objective hearing loss, (3) objective but no subjective hearing loss, and (4) both subjective and objective hearing loss. Many respondents had either subjective or objective or both subjective and objective hearing loss, even within 20 dB of hearing level of both ears in their 40s. These facts implied that early-stage candidates for hearing aids may not require threshold reduction, although aided thresholds were commonly used indicators in fitting."
"18503844","Measurement of hearing aid outcome in the elderly: comparison between young and old elderly.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate speech performance and subjective outcomes for older individuals who have hearing impairment and use digital hearing aids. The outcomes between young and old elderly users were compared.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with hearing loss fitted with digital hearing aids were included. They were divided into two groups. Group A consisted of 32 subjects aged 65 to 80 years, whereas group B had 27 subjects older than 80 years. Speech performance and subjective outcomes were measured 4 months after fitting of hearing aids. Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly-Screening Version (HHIE-S), Client Oriented Scale of Improvement (COSI), satisfaction, and usage questionnaires were used as subjective assessments.RESULTS: Improvements in speech performance were not significantly different between these two groups. There were no statistical differences in terms of HHIE-S score reduction, satisfaction rate, daily usage time, and COSI scores between both groups.CONCLUSION: Age by itself is not a limiting factor for older patients with hearing impairment to benefit from digital hearing aids."
"18415113","A survey of satisfaction and use among patients fitted with a BAHA.","We compared the indices of satisfaction and use among patients wearing an osseo-integrated prosthesis BAHA (bone anchored hearing aid) according to the indications: conductive or mixed hearing loss (CHL) and patients with single side deafness (SSD). The study was carried out among patients wearing a BAHA fitted in one of three French departments between November 2001 and November 2005. Each patient received a postal questionnaire relating to the ease of use and the daily utilization period of the prosthesis, as well as a satisfaction rating (from 1 to 10) evaluating improvement in quality of life, overall satisfaction, improvement in sound localization and satisfaction from the aesthetic point of view. In total, 170 out of 231 patients responded to the questionnaire (response rate of 73.5%). The average age at the time of fitting of the BAHA was 56 years (18-79 years). The SSD group was composed of 118 patients (69.4%): 92 following surgery for vestibular schwannoma, 2 following surgery for meningioma and 24 with &quot;other&quot; causes (e.g. idiopathic sudden deafness, sensori neural hearing loss complicating surgery of the middle ear). The CHL group was composed of 52 patients (30.5%): 44 patients with a chronic otitis and 8 with a malformation of the middle ear. The average duration of use of the prosthesis was 22 months (3-72 months). The average utilization period was higher than 8 h per day in 48.5% of cases. There was a significant difference between the two groups concerning the quality of life (p &lt; 0.0001), general satisfaction (p &lt; 0.0001) and sound localization (p &lt; 0.01). There was no significant difference concerning aesthetics. Among the patients of the CHL group, the levels of satisfaction and quality of life are comparable with recent data in the literature with scores of good or very good. The BAHA thus remains one of the methods of choice for hearing rehabilitation in this group of patients. Among the patients of the SSD group, the levels of satisfaction and quality of life are significantly poorer than in the CHL group, but remain generally good with the exception of sound localization. The treatment of SSD patients with a BAHA is interesting. A study comparing the BAHA with the WIFI CROS system is justified in order to ascertain the respective advantages of these two treatment options."
"19594085","Evaluation of the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids in a veteran sample.","BACKGROUND: The International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA) was developed as a global hearing aid outcome measure targeting seven outcome domains. The published norms were based on a private-pay sample who were fitted with analog hearing aids.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the IOI-HA and to establish normative data in a veteran sample.RESEARCH DESIGN: Survey.STUDY SAMPLE: The participants were 131 male veterans (mean age of 74.3 years, SD = 7.4) who were issued hearing aids with digital signal processing (DSP).INTERVENTION: Hearing aids with DSP that were fitted bilaterally between 2005 and 2007.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Veterans were mailed two copies of the IOI-HA. The participants were instructed to complete the first copy of the questionnaire immediately and the second copy in two weeks. The completed questionnaires were mailed to the laboratory. The psychometric properties of the questionnaire were evaluated. As suggested by Cox and colleagues, the participants were divided into two categories based on their unaided subjective hearing difficulty. The two categories were (1) those with less hearing difficulty (none-to-moderate category) and (2) those who report more hearing difficulty (moderately severe+ category). The norms from the current veteran sample then were compared to the original, published sample. For each hearing difficulty category, the critical difference values were calculated for each item and for the total score.RESULTS: A factor analysis showed that the IOI-HA in the veteran sample had the identical subscale structure as reported in the original sample. For the total scale, the internal consistency was good (Chronbach's alpha = 0.83), and the test-retest reliability was high (lambda = 0.94). Group and individual norms were developed for both hearing difficulty categories in the veteran sample. For each IOI-HA item, the critical difference scores were &lt; 1.0. This finding suggests that for any item on the IOI-HA, there is a 95 percent chance that an observed change of one response unit between two test sessions reflects a true change in outcome for a given domain.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study confirmed that the psychometric properties of the IOI-HA questionnaire are strong and are essentially the same for the veteran sample and the original private-pay sample. The veteran norms, however, produced higher outcomes than those established originally, possibly because of differences in the population samples and/or hearing aid technology. Clinical and research applications of the current findings are presented. Based on the results from the current study, the norms established here should replace the original norms for use in veterans with current hearing aid technology."
"19380509","Do experienced hearing aid users know how to use their hearing AIDS correctly?","PURPOSE: To assess experienced hearing aid users' ability to use their hearing aids correctly.METHOD: In this study, we developed the Practical Hearing Aid Skills Test (PHAST) to objectively test a hearing aid user's ability to manipulate his or her hearing aids. The PHAST requires hearing aid users to perform 8 hearing aid care and use tasks that are basic skills typically taught to new hearing aid users at the time of their hearing aid fitting. The PHAST was administered to a group of 50 experienced hearing aid users. In addition, participants were administered questionnaires about hearing aid satisfaction (i.e., Satisfaction With Amplification in Daily Life; R. M. Cox &amp; G. C. Alexander, 1999), benefit (i.e., Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit; R. M. Cox &amp; G. C. Alexander, 1995), and use.RESULTS: Participants' performance on the PHAST ranged from 48% to 100%, and the scores were normally distributed around the mean (78.56%). No significant relationship was observed between the PHAST and any of the other tests administered in this study. The only variable significantly associated with participants' performance on the PHAST was age.CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study suggest that experienced hearing aid users range from having an excellent understanding of how to use their hearing aids to a poor understanding. The variability in performance among experienced hearing aid users highlights the importance of directly assessing a client's ability to use his or her hearing aids."
"19363721","Pilot study: Efficacy of recalling adult hearing-aid users for reassessment after three years within a publicly-funded audiology service.","Routine recall for reassessment of adult hearing-aid users has been recommended by national audiology standards in the United Kingdom. The objective of this study was to determine whether recalling patients after three years was appropriate within a publicly-funded health service model, by investigating changes in hearing thresholds, and problems presented by adult hearing-aid users at reassessment appointments. Patients who had not had contact (except for the repair service) with the department for three years or more were invited to participate in the pilot reassessment programme, and 62% attended (total of 95 subjects). The reassessment appointment was found to be clearly appropriate for 58% of subjects seen, using our defined criteria. 100% of subjects were also found to need minor interventions. It is suggested that recall for reassessment after three years was generally appropriate for this patient group whose needs were not adequately met by self-referral and repair services. Some evidence was also found that subjects who have not accessed open repair clinics might be suitable for targeting for reassessment appointments."
"19363719","Survey on hearing aid use and satisfaction in Switzerland and their determinants.","The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficiency of the Swiss hearing aid dispensing system, and to determine factors contributing to successful hearing aid provision. A national cross sectional survey was performed using a postal questionnaire with 8707 adult hearing aid owners (response rate 62%). To correct results for a potential non-response bias, 193 randomly selected non-respondents were contacted by telephone. Data on hearing loss and type of hearing aid were provided by the hearing aid dispensing practice. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify determinants of non-regular use and dissatisfaction. Eighty-five percent used their device(s) regularly, 12% only occasionally and 3% never. Eighty percent were satisfied with their aids. Non-regular use of hearing aids was significantly associated with age, gender, regional language, total duration of use, type of amplification, hearing aid category, hearing loss, and dissatisfaction with and difficulties in managing the aid. Dissatisfaction was associated with regional language, total duration of use, difficulties in managing the aid, and non-regular use. It was concluded that rates of regular hearing aid use and satisfaction are high in Switzerland."
"19358456","Using trainable hearing aids to examine real-world preferred gain.","BACKGROUND: While there have been many studies of real-world preferred hearing aid gain, few data are available from participants using hearing aids with today's special features activated. Moreover, only limited data have been collected regarding preferred gain for individuals using trainable hearing aids.PURPOSE: To determine whether real-world preferred hearing aid gain with trainable modern hearing aids is in agreement with previous work in this area, and to determine whether the starting programmed gain setting influences preferred gain outcome.RESEARCH DESIGN: An experimental crossover study. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Following initial treatment, each subject crossed to the opposite group and experienced that treatment.STUDY SAMPLE: Twenty-two adults with downward sloping sensorineural hearing loss served as participants (mean age 64.5; 16 males, 6 females). All were experienced users of bilateral amplification.INTERVENTION: Using a crossover design, participants were fitted to two different prescriptive gain conditions: VC (volume control) start-up 6 dB above NAL-NL1 (National Acoustic Laboratories-Non-linear 1) target or VC start-up 6 dB below NAL-NL1 target. The hearing aids were used in a 10 to 14 day field trial for each condition, and using the VC, the participants could &quot;train&quot; the overall hearing aid gain to their preferred level. During the field trial, daily hearing aid use was logged, as well as the listening situations experienced by the listeners based on the hearing instrument's acoustic scene analysis. The participants completed a questionnaire at the start and end of each field trial in which they rated loudness perceptions and their satisfaction with aided loudness levels.RESULTS: Because several participants potentially experienced floor or ceiling effects for the range of trainable gain, the majority of the statistical analysis was conducted using 12 of the 22 participants. For both VC-start conditions, the trained preferred gain differed significantly from the NAL-NL1 prescriptive targets. More importantly, the initial start-up gain significantly influenced the trained gain; the mean preferred gain for the +6 dB start condition was approximately 9 dB higher than the preferred gain for the -6 dB start condition, and this difference was statistically significant (p &lt; .001). Partial eta squared (n2) = 0.919, which is a large effect size. Deviation from the NAL-NL1 target was not significantly influenced by the time spent in different listening environments, amount of hearing aid use during the trial period, or amount of hearing loss. Questionnaire data showed more appropriate ratings for loudness and higher satisfaction with loudness for the 6 dB below target VC-start condition.CONCLUSIONS: When trainable hearing aids are used, the initial programmed gain of hearing instruments can influence preferred gain in the real world."
"19307291","Hearing aid outcomes for listeners with high-frequency hearing loss.","PURPOSE: To determine whether listeners with primarily high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (HF SNHL) perceived benefit from amplification provided by completely-in-the-canal (CIC) hearing aids.METHOD: The Hearing Handicap for the Elderly-Screening version, the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit, and the Satisfaction With Amplification in Daily Life questionnaires were mailed to 2 groups of listeners (n = 79) who matched preset criteria, including threshold at 2000 Hz and use of CIC amplification. Sixty-seven percent (n = 53) of the questionnaires were returned and were divided into 2 groups. Group I (n = 26) consisted of listeners with normal hearing through 2000 Hz, and Group II (n = 27) consisted of listeners with normal hearing only through 1000 Hz.RESULTS: Results revealed that both groups perceived significant hearing handicap, hearing aid benefit, and hearing aid satisfaction. Differences between the 2 groups on the 3 measures, however, were not statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: Listeners with HF SNHL perceived benefit and satisfaction from amplification with CIC hearing aids. Individuals with SNHL limited to the high frequencies should be considered candidates for amplification."
"21109549","Factors influencing help seeking, hearing aid uptake, hearing aid use and satisfaction with hearing aids: a review of the literature.","OBJECTIVES: This descriptive summary of the literature provides an overview of the available studies (published between January 1980 and January 2009) on correlates of help-seeking behavior for hearing loss, hearing-aid uptake, hearing-aid use, and satisfaction with the device.METHODS: Publications were identified by structured searches in Pubmed and Cinahl and by inspecting the reference lists of relevant articles. The articles covered different stages that a person with hearing impairment may go through: prior to hearing aid fitting, the period covering the fitting and the period post hearing aid fitting. Inclusion of articles occurred according to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were extracted by two independent researchers. Thirty-nine papers were included that identified 31 factors examined in relation to the four outcome measures. These covered personal factors (e.g., source of motivation, expectation, attitude), demographic factors (e.g., age, gender) and external factors (e.g., cost, counseling). Only two studies covered the actual fitting process. There was only one factor positively affecting all four outcome variables. This was self-reported hearing disability. The vast majority of studies showed no relationship of age and gender with any of the outcome domains.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Whereas research of the last 28 years yielded valuable information regarding relevant and irrelevant factors in hearing aid health care, there are still many relevant issues that have never been investigated in controlled studies.

It was developed with the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of hearing aid rehabilitation. Few psychometric properties have been presented for a Swedish translation of the IOI-HA. Furthermore, previous studies have examined the IOI-HA in mainly sensorineural hearing losses, and we do not know how the type of hearing loss affects the outcome.PURPOSE: To evaluate the hearing aid fitting outcome measured in a clinical setting using a Swedish translation of the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA), to determine the psychometric properties of the translation, and to examine how a number of demographic variables such as type of hearing loss affect the outcome.RESEARCH DESIGN: A descriptive and correlational study in a retrospective sample.STUDY SAMPLE: Two hundred and twenty-four (107 females and 117 males; ages 27-94 yr with an average of 66.1 yr) first-time hearing aid users.INTERVENTION: Mostly digital hearing aids (97.8%) were fitted monaurally (60%) or binaurally (40%) between 2007 and 2009.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The subjects were mailed the IOI-HA questionnaire six months after their final appointment, and the completed questionnaire was returned by mail to the clinic. The psychometric properties were evaluated and compared to previous studies using the IOI-HA. The associations between the outcome scores and a number of demographic variables (age, gender, degree of hearing loss, type of hearing loss, number of hearing aids, and type of hearing aids) were examined. Based on the pure tone audiograms, the subjects were divided into three groups; those with conductive hearing losses, sensorineural hearing losses, and mixed hearing losses. For these groups, the differences in outcome measured as IOI-HA were examined.RESULTS: The psychometric properties of the present translation of the IOI-HA showed resemblance in many aspects to previous reports. Furthermore, the type of hearing loss seems to affect the IOI-HA outcome. Hearing loss increases with increasing age, and hearing aid use increases with increasing degree of hearing loss. Subjects with sensorineural hearing losses show significantly poorer scores on items concerning introspective aspects of the outcome in comparison to subjects with mixed hearing losses and subjects with conductive hearing losses. Monaurally fitted subjects tend to report lower scores on average, but monaural or binaural hearing aid fitting do not significantly affect the subjective outcome.CONCLUSIONS: The psychometric properties of the present Swedish translation of the IOI-HA show resemblance in many aspects to previous reports, but the differences observed could be due to differences in the study populations. Overall, the demographic variables examined could not be used as predictors for the hearing aid fitting outcome, and more reliable predictors need to be identified."
"20380609","Survey on hearing aid outcome in Switzerland: associations with type of fitting (bilateral/unilateral), level of hearing aid signal processing, and hearing loss.","The present investigation further analysed results of a previously reported survey with a large sample of hearing aid owners (Bertoli et al, 2009) to determine the individual and technological factors related to hearing aid outcome. In particular the associations of hearing loss, level of signal processing, and fitting type (bilateral versus unilateral fitting) with hearing aid use, satisfaction with and management of the aid were evaluated. A sub-group with symmetrical hearing loss was analysed (n = 6027). Regular use was more frequent in bilateral users and in owners of devices with more complex signal processing, but the strongest determinant of regular use was severity of hearing loss. Satisfaction was higher in the group wearing simple devices, while fitting type and degree of hearing loss had no influence on satisfaction rates. Moderate and severe hearing loss was associated more frequently with poor management of the aid than mild hearing loss. It was concluded that bilateral amplification and advanced signal processing features may contribute to successful hearing aid fitting, but the resulting differences must be considered to be relatively small."
"22030962","Cultural adaptation of the SADL (satisfaction with amplification in daily life) questionaire for Brazilian Portuguese.","There are some motivational processes associated with the use of an Individual Sound Amplification Device (ISAD): acceptance, benefit and satisfaction.</AbstractText>: There are some motivational processes associated with the use of an Individual Sound Amplification Device (ISAD): acceptance, benefit and satisfaction.OBJECTIVE: To make a cultural adaptation of the SADL (Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life) questionnaire to use with the brazilian population; to assess its reproducibility and to describe its results in patients fit with an ISAD.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical study. Translation and cultural adaptation of the questionnaire; translation from English into Portuguese and linguistic adaptation; review of the grammatical and idiomatic equivalence; evaluation of the inter and intra-researcher assessment. There were 30 ISAD users older than 18 years of age participating in the study (mean: 66.36 years); 19 men (63%); 11 women (37%).RESULTS: The participants reported greater satisfaction (mean) for questions: 1 (6.35); 3 (6.85); 5 (6.10); 6 (6.80); 8 (6.33); 9 (6.80); 11 (6.16); 12 (6.93) and 15 (6.52). Less satisfaction: question 4 (3.16); 7 (3.41) and 13 (2.83). The comparison of each question with the first and second application of the questionnaire did not present statistically significant results, thus yielding good reproducibility. There was a greater satisfaction for subscales: Positive Effect (6.50) and Services and Costs (6.26) and less satisfaction for Negative Factors (4.73).CONCLUSION: It was possible to adapt the questionnaire for the brazilian population."
"22026556","Daily life consequences of hearing loss in the elderly.","PURPOSE: To assess the daily life consequences of hearing loss in older adults and to explore the influences of hearing loss, subjective assessment of health and general life satisfaction, gender, age and marital status.METHOD: Eighty-four participants, each older than 65 years, were consecutively recruited from a hospital waiting list for outpatient hearing aid fitting. All participants were assessed by pure-tone audiometry. Daily life consequences of hearing loss were measured using the Hearing Disability and Handicap Scale, which assesses perceived activity limitation and participation restriction. Another questionnaire was used to measure self-assessed health and life satisfaction.RESULTS: Adjusted linear regression analysis showed that activity limitation was significantly associated with increased hearing loss (p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.028) and decreased health (p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.009), and participation restriction with lower estimated life satisfaction (p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.001). Gender, age and marital status were not determinant factors for perceived activity limitation or participation restriction.CONCLUSIONS: Daily life consequences of hearing loss, health conditions and general life satisfaction are closely related. These findings indicate that health factors and psychosocial aspects should be emphasised as a natural part of audiological rehabilitation."
"21942678","Hearing help-seeking and rehabilitation: perspectives of adults with hearing impairment.","OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the perspectives of adults with hearing impairment on hearing help-seeking and rehabilitation.DESIGN: Individual semi-structured interviews were completed.STUDY SAMPLE: In total, 34 adults with hearing impairment in four countries (Australia, Denmark, UK, and USA) participated. Participants had a range of experience with hearing help-seeking and rehabilitation, from never having sought help to being satisfied hearing-aid users.RESULTS: Qualitative content analysis identified four main categories ('perceiving my hearing impairment', 'seeking hearing help', 'using my hearing aids', and 'perspectives and knowledge') and, at the next level, 25 categories. This article reports on the densest categories: they are described, exemplified with interview quotes, and discussed.CONCLUSIONS: People largely described hearing help-seeking and rehabilitation in the context of their daily lives. Adults with hearing impairment rarely described clinical encounters towards hearing help-seeking and rehabilitation as a connected process. They portrayed interactions with clinicians as isolated events rather than chronologically-ordered steps relating to a common goal. Clinical implications of the findings are discussed."
"21795978","Gender and hearing aids: patterns of use and determinants of nonregular use.","OBJECTIVE: Research addressing gender and hearing has focused mainly on differences in the auditory systems of men and women, communication, and psychological issues. Differences between men and women in the use of hearing aids are less clear. To date, no study has examined the effects of gender on hearing aid use as a primary aim. However, use patterns and underlying reasons for not using hearing aids may differ between men and women, or there might be a gender difference in the impact of some determinants on hearing aid use. A consideration of such factors could increase hearing aid use. Therefore, the aim of the present investigation was to provide information about gender-related influences on hearing aid use by examining differences in usage patterns and determinants of nonregular use.DESIGN: This study used cross-sectional survey data from 4979 adult male and 3410 adult female hearing aid owners in Switzerland in 2005. The survey data, including self-reported hearing aid use, were matched to the hearing loss data and the hearing aid technical information. Descriptive analyses were performed for the use patterns, age at first fitting, and audiogram slope. The determinants of nonregular use were examined using logistic regression models that were stratified by gender.RESULTS: Compared with men, women reported a higher prevalence of daily and regular use and a longer daily duration of use of hearing aids. Men more commonly indicated a limited benefit as a reason for nonregular use. The multivariate analyses showed that nonregular use was significantly less likely in women. The audiogram slope strongly contributed to this difference. Stratified analyses showed that for both men and women, poor handling and low satisfaction were associated with a higher likelihood for nonregular hearing aid use. Associations were discrepant for asymmetric hearing loss, which was a risk factor in women but a protective factor in men. Higher risks of nonregular use were found in men with steeper audiogram slopes and longer durations of ownership of their current aids, in women fitted with their first aid in the previous 2 to 5 yr, and in women older than 65 yr.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the present study provides evidence of gender-specific factors that influence hearing aid use patterns in men and women and of groups at higher risk for nonregular hearing aid use. Men with steeper audiogram slopes and the other subgroups of men and women with an increased risk for nonregular use should given particular attention when fitting their aids. As common risk factors for nonregular use, poor handling and low satisfaction should be addressed during the fitting process for all users. Further research is needed to clarify the differential influence of asymmetric hearing loss on hearing aid use in men and women. This information could improve hearing aid use and should be incorporated into daily clinical practice."
"21756843","Rehabilitative online education versus internet discussion group for hearing aid users: a randomized controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: By using the Internet in the audiological rehabilitation process, it might be possible in a cost-effective way to include additional rehabilitation components by informing and guiding hearing aid users about such topics as communication strategies, hearing tactics, and how to handle hearing aids.PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of an online education program for adult experienced hearing aid users including professional guidance by an audiologist and compare it with the effects of participation in an online discussion forum without any professional contact.RESEARCH DESIGN: A randomized controlled study with two groups of participants. Repeated measures at prestudy, immediate follow-up, and a 6 mo follow-up.STUDY SAMPLE: Fifty-nine experienced hearing aid users participated in the study, ranging in age from 24 to 84 yr (mean 63.5 yr).INTERVENTION: The intervention group (N = 29) underwent a five-week rehabilitative online education in which activities for each week included information, tasks, and assignments, and contact with a professional audiologist was included. The participants in the control group (N = 30) were referred to an online discussion forum without any audiologist contact.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A set of questionnaires administered online were used as outcome measures: (1) Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly, (2) International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids, (3) Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life, and (4) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.RESULTS: Significant improvements measured by the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly were found in both groups of participants, and the effects were maintained at the 6 mo follow-up. The results on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale showed that the participants in the intervention group showed reduced symptoms of depression immediately/6 mo after the intervention. At the 6 mo follow-up participants in the control group reported fewer symptoms of anxiety than they did before the intervention started.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that the Internet can be used to deliver education to experienced hearing aid users who report residual hearing problems such that their problems are reduced by the intervention. The study also suggests that online discussion forums could be used in rehabilitation. A combination of online professional supervised education and online informal discussions could be a promising rehabilitation tool."
"21595614","[Hearing aid use and patient satisfaction].","OBJECTIVES: In this study, we assessed the hearing aid usage ratios and durations, patient satisfaction and the probable causes of disuse if they are not used.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A questionnaire with 16 questions was applied to the patients who were prescribed hearing aids in our clinic between January 2007 and December 2009. A total of 517 patients were called by phone. Hundred and seventy-nine of the patients (75 females, 104 males; mean age 6023 years; range 17 to 94 years) participated in the trial. Hearing aid usage ratios and patients' satisfaction were determined and the factors influencing usage were statistically investigated.RESULTS: Hundred and forty-two of the patients used their hearing aids regularly and 37 of the patients either used their aids rarely or never used them. The most common cause reported for disuse was the frequent noise coming from the hearing aid.CONCLUSION: Failure to explain the usage of the hearing aids to the patients and age over 70 years have a statistically significant negative effect on the duration of hearing aid use and patient satisfaction."

The problems caused by sensory deprivation can be minimized with the use of hearing aids (HA).AIM: To analyze the correlation between the prescribed grain and the insertion gain difference and with the results obtained regarding the benefit and satisfaction with the use of hearing aids in unilateral hearing impaired patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective study with 15 subjects, mean age of 41.6 years, of both genders, users of hearing aids effectively. We used the International Questionnaire Results for hearing aids (International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids - IOI-HA), measured with a probe microphone.RESULTS: The mean values in the analyses of the IOI-HA per item were positive and higher than four points. In relation to the objective measures, the frequencies in which we obtained the gain values which were closer to the target were: 1K Hz, 2K Hz and 500 Hz, respectively.CONCLUSION: The satisfaction of individuals using hearing aid unilaterally is not completely correlated to the prescribed gain, because even if the target is not being reached in some frequencies, the individuals were pleased as to the use of their hearing aids."
"21329261","Self-reported outcomes of aural rehabilitation for adult hearing aid users in a South African context.","Hearing impairment has far-reaching consequences for affected individuals, in terms of quality of life indicators. In the public health care sector of South Africa the hearing-impaired population is faced with limited aural rehabilitation services. This study evaluated self-reported outcomes of aural rehabilitation in a group of adults in the public health care sector with a standardised outcomes measurement tool (IOI-HA). Sixty-one participants were included (44% male; sample mean age 69.7 years) through face-to-face or telephonic interviews. Results revealed that the average perceived outcome of participants (5 = best outcome; 1 = poorest outcome) was positive across all domains of the inventory including daily use of hearing aids (4.3); benefits provided by hearing aids (4.3); residual activity limitation (3.9); satisfaction with hearing aids (4.5); residual participation restriction (4.0); impact of hearing difficulties on others (4.6); and changes in quality of life (4.5). Statistically significant relationships for daily use of hearing aids, degree of hearing loss, type of hearing aids fitted, and the perceived benefit from hearing aids in difficult listening environments (p&lt;0.05) were evident. Adult aural rehabilitation for hearing loss in a public health care facility, even without optimal hearing aid fittings, was effective in providing positive perceived outcomes comparable to similar studies in developed countries. The findings advocate for the initiation of affordable and sustainable aural rehabilitation services in developing countries despite apparent resource limitations."
"23169196","Subjective and objective outcomes from new BiCROS technology in a veteran sample.","BACKGROUND: Patients with single-sided deafness (SSD), where one ear has an unaidable hearing loss and the other ear has normal or aidable hearing, often complain of difficulties understanding speech and localizing sound sources, and report a higher self-perceived hearing disability. Patients with SSD may benefit from using contralateral routing of signal (CROS) or bilateral contralateral routing of the signal (BiCROS) amplification. Dissatisfaction of previously available (Bi)CROS devices has been reported, such as, interfering transmissions, low-fidelity sound quality, poor &quot;user-friendly&quot; set-up, and a bulky and cosmetically cumbersome appearance.PURPOSE: Recent advances in hearing aid technology have improved (Bi)CROS hearing aids; however, these devices have not been experimentally evaluated. We hypothesized that newer technology with reports of improved digital signal processing, wireless transmission, and physical design would be as good, or better than, our participants' previous-generation BiCROS systems.RESEARCH DESIGN: A within-subjects, pretest-posttest design was executed.STUDY SAMPLE: Thirty-nine veterans (one female, 38 males; mean age = 74 yr, range = 49-85 yr) from the Audiology Section of the Bay Pines Veterans Affair Healthcare System participated. All participants were previously experienced BiCROS hearing aid users with varying degrees of sensorinerual hearing impairment in their better ear.INTERVENTION: Participants were provided at least 4 wk of consistent use with the new BiCROS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSES: Participants completed three research visits. At Visit 1, with their previous BiCROS, and at Visit 3, with their new BiCROS, the following objective and subjective measures were obtained: (1) soundfield speech-in-noise testing using the Words-In-Noise (WIN) test; (2) speech, spatial, and qualities of the hearing scale (SSQ) questionnaire; (3) selected questions from the MarkeTrak questionnaire; and, (4) three open-ended questions. Data were analyzed using parametric and nonparametric statistics.RESULTS: Overall, the objective (WIN) and subjective (SSQ, MarkeTrak, and open-ended questions) measures indicated that the new BiCROS provided better outcomes than the previous BiCROS system. In addition, an overlap of favorable results was seen across measures.CONCLUSIONS: Of the 39 participants, 95% reported improvements with the new BiCROS and chose to utilize the device regularly. The favorable objective and subjective outcomes indicate that the new BiCROS system is as good, or better than, what was previously utilized by our sample of veterans."

In general, participants with higher daily use are happier."
"23072178","Presbycusis, part 1: can you hear the music of life?","We used a novel approach allowing participants in this study to self-monitor their hearing sensitivity to familiar sounds in the environment. The objective of this approach was to establish whether participants in the 80-89 and 90-99 age groups would recognize the degree of their hearing impairment. It was our hope that participants would value audiology treatment and that it would improve their quality of life over a short period. The pilot study took place in a clinical environment where participants answered survey questions before and after audiology treatment, which pertained to their hearing impairment, morale, social support, and life satisfaction. Caregivers were included in the research to rate and record participants' problem behaviors (e.g., shouting, anger, agitation, repetitive speech dialog, and depression) before, during, and after treatment. This research validates other scientists' findings that annoying problem behaviors may actually be the result of hearing loss because of a person's inability to recognize speech. The pilot study shows that participants with mild dementia adapted well to speech and sounds in the natural environment without agitation as well as to management of hearing aids within a 30-day period. The participants with moderate dementia were slower to adapt. All participants with dementia required the cooperation of their caregivers to maintain hygiene of ear canals and hearing aids and insertion. This study suggests that the sooner people receive treatment for hearing loss, the quicker they are to recognize speech and to master hearing aid technology."

"22752928","Hearing aid satisfaction and use in the advanced digital era.","HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate satisfaction ratings and use patterns of advanced digital hearing aids (HAs) in a group of hearing-impaired adults by means of self-report questionnaires.STUDY DESIGN: A self report questionnaire study.METHODS: One hundred seventy-seven hearing-impaired adults who were fitted with advanced digital HAs at the Speech and Hearing Center at Sheba Medical Center were asked to participate in a structured telephone interview regarding HA satisfaction and use by means of the Satisfaction With Amplification in Daily Life (SADL) questionnaire. Patients who were not using their HAs completed a nonuse questionnaire.RESULTS: One hundred thirty-one patients participated in the survey, yielding a response rate of 74%. Eighty-three percent used their HAs regularly, whereas 17% were nonusers. Of the users, 92% were satisfied to some degree with their HAs. The global SADL score was 5.12 on a scale of 1 to 7. Background variables that were significantly associated with satisfaction ratings were hours of HA use per day, fitting mode (binaural vs. monaural), age, and degree of hearing loss. Although nonuse was not significantly associated with background variables, the main reasons for nonuse were excessive amplification in background noise and minimal functional benefit.CONCLUSIONS: High satisfaction and use rates were characteristic of adults fitted with advanced digital HAs. Patients should be advised that longer use of HAs per day may lead to higher satisfaction and that binaural amplification is advantageous, especially while communicating in noise. Finally, expectation from HA functionality in challenging listening situations should be realistic, as additional research and technology development is still needed."

"22710661","Factors associated with third-party disability in spouses of older people with hearing impairment.","OBJECTIVES: This study had two aims: (1) to describe the extent of third-party disability in a sample of spouses of older people with hearing impairment, and (2) to investigate factors associated with third-party hearing disability. Third-party disability is defined as the disability and functioning of family members as a result of the health condition of their significant other.DESIGN: One hundred older spouses who had partners with hearing impairment participated. All assessments were self-reported, and included a set of measures (the 36-item Significant Other Scale for Hearing Disability, SOS-HEAR; the Relationship Assessment Scale; and the Significant Other Assessment of Communication) administered to the target population of normally hearing older spouses, and those administered to the hearing impaired partners of the spouses in the study (the Self Assessment of Communication). To address the first aim, descriptive statistics were used to describe the extent of third-party hearing disability in the spouses. To address the second aim, binary logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with third-party hearing disability. Factors investigated were focused on the spouse (e.g., spouse perception of relationship satisfaction) and on the partners with hearing impairment (e.g., partners' level of hearing impairment).RESULTS: Most spouses (98%) reported some degree of third-party hearing disability on at least one item of the SOS-HEAR, with the majority reporting a mild disability. Three risk factors were found to be significantly associated with severe or complete third-party disability: lower relationship satisfaction as reported by the spouse (Relationship Assessment Scale), spousal age difference, and spouse perception of their partner's hearing disability (Significant Other Assessment of Communication). Partners' level of hearing impairment, self-reported hearing disability (Self Assessment of Communication), use of hearing aids, and spouse satisfaction that their hearing-impaired partner had done all they could to help with hearing were not associated with third-party disability.CONCLUSIONS: This research study shows that spouses of older people with hearing impairment experience third-party disability as a result of their partners' hearing impairment and that the SOS-HEAR could be used to identify the nature of the disability. The three factors found to be associated with third-party disability could identify spouses at risk of third-party disability related to hearing impairment and form the basis of an intervention."
"22618352","Auditory cortex signs of age-related hearing loss.","Age-related hearing loss, or presbyacusis, is a major public health problem that causes communication difficulties and is associated with diminished quality of life. Limited satisfaction with hearing aids, particularly in noisy listening conditions, suggests that central nervous system declines occur with presbyacusis and may limit the efficacy of interventions focused solely on improving audibility. This study of 49 older adults (M = 69.58, SD = 8.22 years; 29 female) was designed to examine the extent to which low and/or high frequency hearing loss was related to auditory cortex morphology. Low and high frequency hearing constructs were obtained from a factor analysis of audiograms from these older adults and 1,704 audiograms from an independent sample of older adults. Significant region of interest and voxel-wise gray matter volume associations were observed for the high frequency hearing construct. These effects occurred most robustly in a primary auditory cortex region (Te1.0) where there was also elevated cerebrospinal fluid with high frequency hearing loss, suggesting that auditory cortex atrophies with high frequency hearing loss. These results indicate that Te1.0 is particularly affected by high frequency hearing loss and may be a target for evaluating the efficacy of interventions for hearing loss."

A comparative study].","BACKGROUND: In the face of the rapid development of hearing aid system technology it is helpful to regularly study the user benefit of the current generation.TEST PERSONS AND METHODS: To contribute to the question on how the user benefit of current hearing aids compares with the benefit of the previous generation of hearing aids, a multicentre study was carried out in cooperation with 79 hearing aid acoustics companies in Germany. The user benefit of modern hearing aids in everyday life was assessed by asking end users to participate in a survey by completing a questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 20 items, 10 of which were taken from validated international inventories (SSQ: Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing scale, IOI-HA: International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids) and the other 10 were formulated particularly for this purpose.RESULTS: A total of 664 usable questionnaires were returned whereby 421 responders were first time users and 243 responders were previous hearing aid users. The results of the present study showed that modern hearing aid system technology provides significant extra benefits at the 5% level relative to the previous generation of hearing aids for all variables tested in this study.CONCLUSIONS: Even though the amount of gain in terms of user benefit may be overestimated due to well-known placebo effects, an obvious net effect was evident. Correlations between the level of hearing aid benefit and possible influencing factors, such as age, gender, subjects own hearing aid, duration of use or hearing loss, could not be identified."
"23725663","Success and failure factors for hearing-aid prescription: results of a French national survey.","OBJECTIVES: To identify epidemiological, socioeconomic, audiometric and environmental factors of success and failure of hearing-aid prescription, and to assess hearing-aid efficacy at 6-9 months after prescription.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective nationwide survey was conducted in France on 184 patients with age-related hearing loss. Inclusion data were collected by a questionnaire filled out by the ENT specialist and patient, and with a second questionnaire filled out by telephone contact with the patient 6-9 months later.RESULTS: One-third of patients failed to fulfill the prescription, either for financial reasons or for lack of interest in correcting their disability. For the other two-thirds, the factors favoring consultation with a hearing-aid fitting specialist seemed to be: leisure activity requiring good hearing, living in a couple or family, spontaneous initial ENT consultation, strong motivation, monthly income greater than 1200, longstanding hearing impairment, and difficulty in listening to television and following a conversation in noise. Eighty percent of hearing-aid trials were successful; 60% of prescriptions were thus followed by hearing-aid purchase. The main three criteria determining purchase were the advice of the hearing-aid fitting specialist, and the price and the effectiveness of the apparatus on trial. In the four daily life situations presented in the questionnaire, the hearing-aid was worn for 8 hours or more in 90% of cases, found useful in 70% and proved satisfactory in 70%. Age-related hearing loss, whether metabolic or sensorineural, benefited from hearing-aid correction in 86% of cases.CONCLUSIONS: Indications for hearing-aid prescription should take account of the patient's degree of motivation, awareness of disability, and income. The advice of the ENT and hearing-aid fitting specialists plays a key role in the patient's acceptance of the hearing-aid. Hearing-aids seem to enhance quality of life significantly in age-related hearing loss subjects."
"23575461","Real-life efficacy and reliability of training a hearing aid.","OBJECTIVES: Commercial trainable hearing aids (HA) (i.e., devices that for a period are adjusted by the user in different acoustic environments and that subsequently with changing environments automatically adapt to the user's preferred settings), are readily available; however, little information exists about the efficacy of training a HA. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and reliability of training a HA in everyday environments.DESIGN: The participants were 26 hearing-impaired volunteers with a median age of 79 years and an average pure-tone average of 53 dB HL. Test devices were commercial, multimemory, prototype devices that enabled training of the compression characteristics in four frequency bands and in six sound classes. Participants wore the National Acoustic Laboratories nonlinear fitting procedure version 2 prescription for 3 weeks and trained the devices from the prescribed response for 3 weeks, before comparing their trained response with the prescription for 2 weeks. The devices were reset to the prescription, and 19 participants repeated the training and comparison trials. During the comparison trial, participants made daily diary ratings of their satisfaction with the programs, and a structured interview was completed at the end of the comparison trial.RESULTS: The participants displayed different needs for changing the prescription, with more daily adjustments leading to training across more sound classes. Unreliable observations were obtained from 8 participants after each of the test and retest comparison trials. Of the 10 participants who made sufficient changes to the prescription during the first trial, 80% preferred their trained response. The 8 &quot;low trainers&quot; reported no preference, and also reported lower overall satisfaction with the device. Fewer adjustments were made during the repeat trial, resulting in less training. Significant correlations between trained variations were seen for 63% of 19 participants. Of the 10 participants who provided valid data after both comparison trials, those who trained the device consistently generally showed consistent preferences, and vice versa.CONCLUSIONS: For those who wanted a change to the prescription, training was mostly effective. Limited data on reliability showed reasonable consistency in training outcomes and preferences. Findings, in particular on reliability, should be verified in larger populations. A guideline on how to clinically manage training with clients is presented."
"23506664","Client labor: adults with hearing impairment describing their participation in their hearing help-seeking and rehabilitation.","BACKGROUND: The uptake and use of hearing aids is low compared to the prevalence of hearing impairment. People who seek help and take part in a hearing aid rehabilitation process participate actively in this process in several ways.PURPOSE: In order to gain more knowledge on the challenges of hearing help-seeking and hearing aid use, this qualitative study sought to understand the ways that people with hearing impairment describe themselves as active participants throughout the hearing aid rehabilitation process.RESEARCH DESIGN: In this qualitative interview study we examined the hearing rehabilitation process from the perspective of the hearing impaired. In this article we describe how the qualitative interview material was interpreted by a pragmatic qualitative thematic analysis. The analysis described in this article focused on the efforts, initiatives, actions, and participation the study participants described that they had engaged in during their rehabilitation.STUDY SAMPLE: Interviews were conducted with people with hearing impairment in Australia, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The 34 interview participants were distributed equally between the sites, just as men and women were almost equally represented (56% women). The average age of the participants was 64. All participants had a hearing impairment in at least one ear. The participants were recruited to represent a range of experiences with hearing help-seeking and rehabilitation.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: With each participant one qualitative semistructured interview ranging between 1 and 2 hr was carried out. The interviews were transcribed verbatim, read through several times, and themes were identified, defined, and reviewed by an iterative process.RESULTS: From this thematic focus a concept called &quot;client labor&quot; has emerged. Client labor contains nine subthemes divided into three overarching groups: cognitive labor, emotional labor, and physical labor. The participants' experiences and meaning-making related to these conceptual types of efforts is described.CONCLUSIONS: The study findings have implications for the clinical encounter between people with hearing impairment and hearing health-care professionals. We suggest that a patient-centered approach that bears in mind the client's active participation could help toward improving clinical dispensing, fitting, and counseling practices with the end goal to increase hearing aid benefit and satisfaction."
"23357806","Comparison of multichannel wide dynamic range compression and ChannelFree processing in open canal hearing instruments.","BACKGROUND: Multichannel wide dynamic range compression (WDRC) and ChannelFree processing have similar goals yet differ significantly in terms of signal processing. Multichannel WDRC devices divide the input signal into separate frequency bands; a separate level is determined within each frequency band; and compression in each band is based on the level within each band. ChannelFree processing detects the wideband level, and gain adjustments are based on the wideband signal level and adjusted up to 20,000 times per second. Although both signal processing strategies are currently available in hearing aids, it is unclear if differences in these signal processing strategies affect the performance and/or preference of the end user.PURPOSE: The purpose of the research was to determine the effects of multichannel wide dynamic range compression and ChannelFree processing on performance and/or preference of listeners using open-canal hearing instruments.RESEARCH DESIGN: An experimental study in which subjects were exposed to a repeated measures design was utilized.STUDY SAMPLE: Fourteen adult listeners with mild sloping to moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss participated (mean age 67 yr).DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Participants completed two 5 wk trial periods for each signal processing strategy. Probe microphone, behavioral and subjective measures were conducted unaided and aided at the end of each trial period.RESULTS: Behavioral and subjective results for both signal processing strategies were significantly better than unaided results; however, behavioral and subjective results were not significantly different between the signal processing strategies.CONCLUSIONS: Multichannel WDRC and ChannelFree processing are both effective signal processing strategies that provide significant benefit for hearing instrument users. Overall preference between the strategies may be related to the degree of hearing loss of the user, high-frequency in-situ levels, and/or acceptance of background noise."
"25991994","Degree of satisfaction among hearing aid users.","INTRODUCTION: Hearing loss (HL) is defined as the complete or partial loss of hearing ability.AIMS: To characterize (1) the degree of satisfaction among adult and elderly hearing aid (HA) users who were treated by a public hearing health service and (2) the relationship between satisfaction and the variables of gender, age, degree of HL, and type of HA.METHOD: The clinical and experimental study included the administration of the Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life (SADL) questionnaire to 110 patients who had used HAs for more than 3 months and were 18 years of age or older.RESULTS: Test patients were sex-balanced (48% were women) and had a mean age of 67 years. A relatively high incidence of sensorineural moderate HL was detected in the study patients (66%) and device B was the most commonly used HA type (48%). No significant differences were evident between HA satisfaction and sex. The importance placed on services/costs and personal image varied between age groups. Correlation was evident at all levels between user satisfaction and amplification. Decreased satisfaction was observed in individuals with severe and/or profound HL. The type of HA used yielded statistically significant differences in the positive effects referring.CONCLUSION: No correlations were evident between the different factors proposed. HA users exhibited high levels of satisfaction in all SADL areas."
"25365367","What is important for hearing aid satisfaction? Application of the expectancy-disconfirmation model.","BACKGROUND: Between 68.1-89.5% of clients report that they are satisfied with their hearing aids. Two variables that are thought to contribute to dissatisfaction with hearing aids are product performance, and a mismatch between performance and client prefitting expectations about hearing-aid performance (i.e., disconfirmation). A focus on variables related to satisfaction is relevant to improving hearing rehabilitation services.PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine if measures of hearing-aid performance and disconfirmation, specifically related to hearing ability and hearing-aid problems, were associated with overall hearing-aid satisfaction among a sample of hearing-aid users.RESEARCH DESIGN: A retrospective research design was employed.STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 123 individuals participated in the study (57% male; mean age: 72 yr). All participants owned hearing aids.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A personal details questionnaire and the Profile of Hearing Aid Consumer Satisfaction questionnaire (Wong et al, 2009) were completed by participants, 3-12 mo after they obtained hearing aids. Overall hearing-aid satisfaction was a dichotomized variable (satisfaction vs. dissatisfaction); therefore, logistic regression modeling was applied to the data to determine which variables were associated with overall hearing-aid satisfaction.RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of the sample reported that they were satisfied with their hearing aids. Hearing-aid satisfaction was associated with the ability to hear with hearing aids and better-than-expected performance in this same area; fewer hearing-aid problems; and fewer problems with hearing-aid manipulation, hearing-aid appearance, and wearer discomfort than were anticipated before hearing-aid fitting.CONCLUSIONS: It is recommended that to improve hearing-aid satisfaction, clinicians should ensure optimal hearing-aid benefit in the listening situations that the person with hearing impairment most wants to hear better; reduce the likelihood of hearing-aid problems occurring; and promote positive disconfirmation (performance exceeds expectations) with respect to both hearing ability and hearing-aid performance through the education of clients about the likely benefits of hearing aids in a variety of listening environments, and the potential problems they could face with hearing-aid manipulation and wearer discomfort."
"25267134","Communicating with assistive listening devices and age-related hearing loss: Perceptions of older Australians.","Abstract Age-related hearing loss can impact adversely on the delivery of primary care and cannot necessarily be remedied by hearing aid technology. A study of 20 older Australians living in a Queensland retirement village and residential hostel complex was undertaken to investigate how communication might be advanced through an assistive listening device (ALD). Most participants were women aged over 85 years; almost all had hearing loss and wore hearing aids. Tests with an ALD found very high levels of satisfaction with understanding speech and sound quality amongst participants. However, few had heard previously of ALDs, all required individualised assistance to fit and use the device and rated ease of use less highly. The findings affirm those of previous studies that ALD technology has a role in communication for older hearing impaired people and for hearing rehabilitation. Its potential to enhance quality of life can be facilitated and promoted through nursing practice, but requires professional and consumer education so that it is not overlooked as a communication option.

"24952106","Clinical effectiveness of wireless CROS (contralateral routing of offside signals) hearing aids.","This study evaluated the clinical effectiveness of wireless contralateral routing of offside signals hearing aids (CROS) in patients with severe to profound unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (USNHL). Twenty-one patients with USNHL were enrolled in this prospective study. The change of subjective satisfaction was evaluated using three questionnaires (K-HHIE, K-IOI-HA, K-SSQ). Changes in objective measurements were evaluated with sound localization test (SLT) and hearing in noise test (HINT). These tests were performed at pre-CROS fitting, 2 and 4 weeks after use of CROS. Subjects were grouped according to the age: young (&lt;40 years) vs. old (=40 years) group. The average K-HHIE and K-SSQ scores significantly improved with the use of CROS. SLT result revealed that hit rate and error degree improved in the young group and lateralization ability improved in both groups. In quiet environments, the reception threshold for speech also indicated a significant benefit in the young group. When the noise was presented to the normal ear, HINT revealed benefit of CROS, while loss of performance with CROS use was significant when noise was presented to the impaired ear. Wireless CROS provided increased satisfaction and overall improvement of localization and hearing. Although true binaural hearing cannot be obtained, CROS is a practical option for rehabilitation of USNHL."
"24828222","A preliminary evaluation of the active communication education program in a sample of 87-year-old hearing impaired individuals.","BACKGROUND: Previous research suggests that audiological rehabilitation for older adults could include group communication programs in addition to hearing aid fitting or as an alternative to hearing aid fitting for those people who do not wish to proceed with hearing aids. This pilot study was a first attempt to evaluate a Swedish version of such a program, Active Communication Education (ACE), which had been developed and previously evaluated in Australia (Hickson et al, 2007a).PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to explore the use of the ACE program in an older-old population of people aged 87 yr in Sweden.RESEARCH DESIGN: A within-subject intervention study.STUDY SAMPLE: The participants were recruited from the Elderly in Linkping Screening Assessment (ELSA), a population-based study of the functional abilities of all inhabitants of the city of Linkoping aged 85 yr in 2007. Participants who responded to the hearing related items in the ELSA study were approached for this study; 29 people agreed to undertake ACE, and 23 (79%) completed three or more sessions.INTERVENTION: The ACE program consists of five weekly 2 hr group sessions with six to ten participants per group.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Self-report measures of communication strategy use, activity and participation, health-related quality of life, and depression were obtained preprogram, 3 wk postprogram, and 6 mo postprogram. Within-group changes and effect sizes were calculated. In addition, outcomes were measured postprogram using the International Outcome Inventory-Alternative Interventions (IOI-AI; Noble, 2002) and a modified version of the Client Oriented Scale of Improvement (COSI; Dillon et al, 1997; Hickson et al, 2007b), and qualitative feedback was obtained.RESULTS: The effect size of ACE was small (0.03-0.27), and, in the sample of 23 included in this pilot study, differences in pre- and postprogram assessments were not statistically significant. Results from the IOI-AI and the modified COSI indicated that these elderly participants found the program to be beneficial, and 90% stated that the course had increased their ability to deal with hearing loss and the problems it creates.CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary investigation indicates the potential benefits of ACE for older adults, and further research is needed with larger numbers of participants in different age groups to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the ACE program for a general Swedish population."
"24828216","Prediction of IOI-HA scores using speech reception thresholds and speech discrimination scores in quiet.","BACKGROUND: Outcome measures can be used to improve the quality of the rehabilitation by identifying and understanding which variables influence the outcome. This information can be used to improve outcomes for clients. In clinical practice, pure-tone audiometry, speech reception thresholds (SRTs), and speech discrimination scores (SDSs) in quiet or in noise are common assessments made prior to hearing aid (HA) fittings. It is not known whether SRT and SDS in quiet relate to HA outcome measured with the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA).PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between pure-tone average (PTA), SRT, and SDS in quiet and IOI-HA in both first-time and experienced HA users.RESEARCH DESIGN: SRT and SDS were measured in a sample of HA users who also responded to the IOI-HA.STUDY SAMPLE: Fifty-eight Danish-speaking adult HA users.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The psychometric properties were evaluated and compared to previous studies using the IOI-HA. The associations and differences between the outcome scores and a number of descriptive variables (age, gender, fitted monaurally/binaurally with HA, first-time/experienced HA users, years of HA use, time since last HA fitting, best ear PTA, best ear SRT, or best ear SDS) were examined. A multiple forward stepwise regression analysis was conducted using scores on the separate IOI-HA items, the global score, and scores on the introspection and interaction subscales as dependent variables to examine whether the descriptive variables could predict these outcome measures.RESULTS: Scores on single IOI-HA items, the global score, and scores on the introspection (items 1, 2, 4, and 7) and interaction (items 3, 5, and 6) subscales closely resemble those previously reported. Multiple regression analysis showed that the best ear SDS predicts about 18-19% of the outcome on items 3 and 5 separately, and about 16% on the interaction subscale (sum of items 3, 5, and 6) CONCLUSIONS: The best ears SDS explains some of the variance displayed in the IOI-HA global score and the interaction subscale. The relation between SDS and IOI-HA suggests that a poor unaided SDS might in itself be a limiting factor for the HA rehabilitation efficacy and hence the IOI-HA outcome. The clinician could use this information to align the user's HA expectations to what is within possible reach."

A total of 555 (78%) patients replied and 426 patients (77%) submitted their answers to the questionnaires.RESULTS: Female patients had significantly higher Tinnitus Handicap Inventory scores than male patients. An open question about the experienced quality of the care that the patients obtained at our ENT clinics resulted in 159 comments (37%). The majority of the comments were about the hearing aids and many patients did not identify their hearing aids as a treatment. Patients who did not feel that the treatment they obtained at our ENT clinics was good had a significantly higher pure tone average (PTA).CONCLUSION: The results showed that many patients who did not feel that the treatment they obtained at our ENT clinics was good had no hearing aids (61%) and this level of dissatisfaction was significantly higher than in patients who stated that they had received treatment (45%). The use of hearing aids as the main treatment model in patients suffering from tinnitus and hearing impairment can be recommended in these patients. Further research is required to find an approach that could motivate patients with both tinnitus and hearing impairment to use hearing aids."
"24751499","Managing age-related hearing loss: how to use hearing aids efficiently - a mini-review.","Using hearing aids may contribute to better functioning in the everyday lives of hearing-impaired older individuals. We introduce an integrative concept for the efficient use of hearing aids that involves both satisfaction with, and behaviour towards, hearing aids. We review theoretical and empirical work on the predictors of the efficient use of hearing aids in everyday life. Furthermore, we contend that the use of hearing aids requires improved understanding of the variability of hearing demands within specific contexts of everyday life (e.g. conversation with family members, listening to music). The efficiency of hearing aid use thus depends on the fit of situational demands, personal resources, and the specific configuration of the hearing aid device. We propose an integrative person-environment-fit model that advances concepts of selection, optimisation, and compensation to hearing aid efficiency. We discuss the implications of this model for research and for practitioners in the field of gerontology."

"24528290","Patient-centred audiological rehabilitation: perspectives of older adults who own hearing aids.","OBJECTIVE: Patient-centred care is a term frequently associated with quality health care. Despite extensive literature from a range of health-care professions that provide description and measurement of patient-centred care, a definition of patient-centredness in audiological rehabilitation is lacking. The current study aimed to define patient-centred care specific to audiological rehabilitation from the perspective of older adults who have owned hearing aids for at least one year.DESIGN: Research interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of older adults concerning their perceptions of patient-centredness in audiological rehabilitation, and qualitative content analysis was undertaken.STUDY SAMPLE: The participant sample included ten adults over the age of 60 years who had owned hearing aids for at least one year.RESULTS: Data analysis revealed three dimensions to patient-centred audiological rehabilitation: the therapeutic relationship, the players (audiologist and patient), and clinical processes. Individualised care was seen as an overarching theme linking each of these dimensions.CONCLUSIONS: This study reported two models: the first model describes what older adults with hearing aids believe constitutes patient-centred audiological rehabilitation. The second provides a guide to operationalised patient-centred care. Further research is required to address questions pertaining to the presence, nature, and impact of patient-centred audiological rehabilitation."

"26262032","Web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids.","INTRODUCTION: Adults and elderly users of hearing aids suffer psychosocial reactions as a result of hearing loss. Auditory rehabilitation is typically carried out with support from a speech therapist, usually in a clinical center. For these cases, there is a lack of computer-based self-training tools for minimizing the psychosocial impact of hearing deficiency.OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids.METHODS: Two modules were developed for the web system: an information module based on guidelines for using hearing aids; and an auditory training module presenting a sequence of training exercises for auditory abilities along the lines of the auditory skill steps within auditory processing. We built aweb system using PHP programming language and a MySQL database .from requirements surveyed through focus groups that were conducted by healthcare information technology experts. The web system was evaluated by speech therapists and hearing aid users. An initial sample of 150 patients at DSA/HRAC/USP was defined to apply the system with the inclusion criteria that: the individuals should be over the age of 25 years, presently have hearing impairment, be a hearing aid user, have a computer and have internet experience. They were divided into two groups: a control group (G1) and an experimental group (G2). These patients were evaluated clinically using the HHIE for adults and HHIA for elderly people, before and after system implementation. A third web group was formed with users who were invited through social networks for their opinions on using the system. A questionnaire evaluating hearing complaints was given to all three groups. The study hypothesis considered that G2 would present greater auditory perception, higher satisfaction and fewer complaints than G1 after the auditory training. It was expected that G3 would have fewer complaints regarding use and acceptance of the system.RESULTS: The web system, which was named SisTHA portal, was finalized, rated by experts and hearing aid users and approved for use. The system comprised auditory skills training along five lines: discrimination; recognition; comprehension and temporal sequencing; auditory closure; and cognitive-linguistic and communication strategies. Users needed to undergo auditory training over a minimum period of 1 month: 5 times a week for 30 minutes a day. Comparisons were made between G1 and G2 and web system use by G3.CONCLUSION: The web system developed was approved for release to hearing aid users. It is expected that the self-training will help improve effective use of hearing aids, thereby decreasing their rejection."

The aim of this project was to investigate the degree of satisfaction of aged users with their hearing aids using the Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life (SADL) scale, which emphasizes non-auditory factors contributing to satisfaction as well as benefit.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The Persian version of SADL scale was completed by 40 patients who received monaural hearing aid fitting at south of the Iran from December 2013 and March 2014. SADL subscales of the SADL were evaluated according to the type and degree of hearing loss, the pure tone audiogram pattern and shape and type of the hearing aid.RESULTS: The results associated with the SADL subscales revealed a greater satisfaction associated with the Positive Effect and Service and Costs subscales. Subjects with different degree of hearing loss were very satisfied in terms of positive effect subscale.CONCLUSIONS: Participants reported a considerable level of satisfaction with their hearing aids. Appropriate guidance for using hearing aids and spending more time for counseling can improve the satisfaction level of this age group."

The results of a regression analysis revealed that in study 1, 22% of the variance in hearing aid satisfaction scores was predicted by perceived social support, satisfaction with one's hearing health care provider, duration of daily hearing aid use, and openness. In study 2, 43% of the variance in hearing aid satisfaction was predicted by perceived social support, hearing aid benefit, neuroticism, and hearing aid style. Overall, perceived social support was the best predictor of hearing aid satisfaction in both studies. After controlling for response style (i.e., acquiescence or the tendency to respond positively), the correlation between perceived social support and hearing aid satisfaction remained the same in study 1 (r = 0.34, p &lt; 0.001) and was lower in study 2 (r = 0.39, p &lt; 0.001), although the change in correlation was not significant.CONCLUSIONS: The results from study 1 provide evidence to suggest that perceived social support is a significant predictor of satisfaction with hearing aids, a finding that was replicated in a different sample of participants investigated in study 2. A significant relationship between perceived social support and hearing aid satisfaction was observed in both studies, even though the composition of the two samples differed in terms of age, relationship status, income, proportion of individuals with unilateral versus bilateral hearing impairment, and lifetime experience with hearing aids. The results from both studies 1 and 2 provide no support for the claim that participant response style accounts for the relationship between hearing aid satisfaction and perceived social support."
"25992097","Level of user satisfaction with hearing AIDS and environment: the international outcome inventory for hearing AIDS.","Introduction The main function of hearing is to enable oral communication. Hearing loss impairs communication skills. Objective To evaluate the level of user satisfaction with hearing aids. Methods This is a cross-sectional group study comprising 108 subjects (56% men and 44% women). The average age of the subjects was 77 years. These subjects had been recently fitted with their hearing aids and showed sensorineural (90%) and mixed (10%) hearing loss as determined via the Questionnaire International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids Outcome Inventory (IOI-HA), which determined the benefit and satisfaction obtained by sound amplification. Results The hearing aids improved the quality of life of 52.78% of the patients, which was revealed by their high scores (mean<U+2009>=<U+2009>27.3). The relationship of the user with the environment was significantly better (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) than that of the user with the hearing aid. Conclusion IOI-HA is a simple and easy-to-use tool. Based on the results of this study, we can show a high degree of satisfaction with their hearing aids in the majority of the participants, which improved the quality of life. "
"25751693","Comparisons of client and clinician views of the importance of factors in client-clinician interaction in hearing aid purchase decisions.","BACKGROUND: Despite clinical recognition of the adverse effects of acquired hearing loss, only a small proportion of adults who could benefit use hearing aids. Hearing aid adoption has been studied in relationship to client-related and hearing aid technology-related factors. The influence of the client-clinician interaction in the decision to purchase hearing aids has not been explored in any depth.PURPOSE: Importance ratings of a sample of adults having a recent hearing aid recommendation (clients) and hearing healthcare professionals (clinicians) from across Canada were compared on factors in client-clinician interactions that influence hearing aid purchase decisions.RESEARCH DESIGN: A cross-sectional approach was used to obtain online and paper-based concept ratings.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Participants were 43 adults (age range, 45-85 yr) who had received a first hearing aid recommendation in the 3 mo before participation. A total of 54 audiologists and 20 hearing instrument practitioners from a variety of clinical settings who prescribed or dispensed hearing aids completed the concept-rating task. The task consisted of 122 items that had been generated via concept mapping in a previous study and which resulted in the identification of eight concepts that may influence hearing aid purchase decisions. Participants rated &quot;the importance of each of the statements in a person's decision to purchase a hearing aid&quot; on a 5-point Likert scale, from 1 = minimally important to 5 = extremely important. For the initial data analysis, the ratings for each of the items included in each concept were averaged for each participant to provide an estimate of the overall importance rating of each concept. Multivariate analysis of variance was used to compare the mean importance ratings of the clients to the clinicians. Ratings of individual statements were also compared in order to investigate the directionality of the importance ratings within concepts.RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the mean ratings for clients and clinicians for the concepts understanding and meeting client needs, conveying device information by clinician, supporting choices and shared decision making, and factors in client readiness. Three concepts-understanding and meeting client needs, conveying device information by clinician, and supporting choices and shared decision making-were rated as more important by clients than by clinicians. One concept (ie, factors in client readiness) was rated as more important by clinicians than by clients.CONCLUSIONS: The concepts rated as most important by clients and clinicians are consistent with components of several existing models of client-centered and patient-centered care. These concepts reflect the clients' perception of the importance of their involvement in the decision-making process. A preliminary model of client-centered care within the hearing aid uptake process and implications for clinical audiology are described."
"25736468","Bone-conduction hearing aids in an elderly population: complications and quality of life assessment.","To determine whether an elderly population with hearing impairment can be adequately rehabilitated with a bone-conduction hearing aid and whether the putative relationship between the elderly and an increased complication rate is justified. The study design was a retrospective case note review with a postal and telephone questionnaire, which was carried out in a tertiary centre. All patients aged 60 or over underwent implantation with a bone-conduction aid between 2009 and 2013 for conductive, SSD or mixed hearing loss. Outcome measures were complication rates and quality of life assessment using the Glasgow Benefit Inventory. The influence of patient and surgical factors on the complication rate was assessed. Fifty-one patients were implanted. Mean age was 67 years (range 60-89 years). The mean benefit, satisfaction and global GBI scores were 70 % (range 0-100 %), 70 % (0-100 %) and 82 % (83-100 %), respectively. The residual disability was 18 % (0-25 %). The adverse skin reaction rate was 16 % and the fixture loss rate was 2 %. There was a demonstrable increase in the complication rate with the dermatome (45 %; 5 patients) compared to the Sheffield 'S' (13 %; 2 patients) or linear incision techniques (29 %; 7 patients). The bone-conduction hearing aids are ideal method of hearing rehabilitation in the elderly for all forms of hearing loss. It provides significant benefit with no increased complication rate, which is imperative if social isolation is to be avoided and cognition preserved in this growing elderly population."
"25690777","Estimation of Signal-to-Noise Ratios in Realistic Sound Scenarios.","BACKGROUND: Both in the design of hearing-device features, such as noise reduction, and in the evaluation measurements of such features, there is a need for more information about the sound scenarios hearing-device users encounter. The limitations of adaptive speech tests as outcome measures in the evaluation of hearing-device features have been discussed. The obvious alternative to adaptive speech testing is to test at a fixed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, the question is which SNRs should be used if the test reflects real-life situations.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to estimate SNRs in realistic sound environments encountered by hearing aid users.RESEARCH DESIGN: Research design was a descriptive study where recorded sound files were statistically analyzed.STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 20 experienced, bilaterally fitted hearing aid users, all satisfied with their current hearing aids, made recordings for 3-4 days. The informants were instructed to record different situations in daily life and were told that all situations were of equal importance. The informants ranged in age from 18-81 yr old, and they had various occupations and varying hearing-loss configurations.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The total duration of the recorded material for each informant was, on average, 84 min; the number of recordings was, on average, 17 per informant. The sound files were categorized based on the type of background noise and were analyzed with use of a manual noise estimation procedure. Segments of speech with noise present were cut out from the original recordings. Corresponding noise-only segments were also extracted. On the basis of power calculations for these two types of recorded segments, the SNR was estimated. Frequency-specific and overall SNRs, calculated both based on unweighted and A-weighted speech and noise levels, were derived. An estimation uncertainty measure was also developed.RESULTS: The range of SNRs found in the material was large. The most striking finding was that there were very few recorded situations where the SNR was negative or even close to 0 dB. For speech-in-babble noise, the average SNR was approximately 5 dB. The estimation uncertainty was generally low but became higher in highly fluctuating noises and at very low SNRs.CONCLUSIONS: The estimated SNRs were higher than previously reported. The results can be used in the design and evaluation of hearing-device features."
"25599909","Use of the satisfaction with amplification in daily life questionnaire to assess patient satisfaction following remote hearing aid adjustments (telefitting).","BACKGROUND: Hearing loss can affect approximately 15% of the pediatric population and up to 40% of the adult population. The gold standard of treatment for hearing loss is amplification of hearing thresholds by means of a hearing aid instrument. A hearing aid is an electronic device equipped with a topology of only three major components of aggregate cost. The gold standard of hearing aid fittings is face-to-face appointments in hearing aid centers, clinics, or hospitals. Telefitting encompasses the programming and adjustments of hearing aid settings remotely. Fitting hearing aids remotely is a relatively simple procedure, using minimal computer hardware and Internet access.OBJECTIVE: This project aimed to examine the feasibility and outcomes of remote hearing aid adjustments (telefitting) by assessing patient satisfaction via the Portuguese version of the Satisfaction With Amplification in Daily Life (SADL) questionnaire.METHODS: The Brazilian Portuguese version of the SADL was used in this experimental research design. Participants were randomly selected through the Rehabilitation Clinical (Espaco Reouvir) of the Otorhinolaryngology Department Medical School University of Sao Paulo. Of the 8 participants in the study, 5 were female and 3 were male, with a mean age of 71.5 years. The design consisted of two face-to-face sessions performed within 15 working days of each other. The remote assistance took place 15 days later.RESULTS: The average scores from this study are above the mean scores from the original SADL normative data. These indicate a high level of satisfaction in participants who were fitted remotely.CONCLUSIONS: The use of an evaluation questionnaire is a simple yet effective method to objectively assess the success of a remote fitting. Questionnaire outcomes can help hearing stakeholders improve the National Policy on Hearing Health Care in Brazil. The results of this project indicated that patient satisfaction levels of those fitted remotely were comparable to those fitted in the conventional manner, that is, face-to-face."
"27738608","Satisfaction with Hearing Aids Based on Technology and Style among Hearing Impaired Persons.","INTRODUCTION: Hearing loss is one of the most disabling impairments. Using a hearing aid as an attempt to improve the hearing problem can positively affect the quality of life for these people. This research was aimed to assess satisfaction of hearing impaired patients with their hearing aids regarding the employed technology and style.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This descriptive-analytic cross-sectional research was conducted on 187 subjects with hearing loss who were using a hearing aid. The subjects were over 18 years of age and were using a hearing aid for at least 6 months. The Persian version of Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life (SADL) questionnaire was the instrument which was used for assessing satisfaction with the hearing aid. Cronbach's alpha was calculated to be 0.80 for instrument reliability.RESULTS: A significant difference was observed among satisfaction subscales' mean scores with hearing aid technology. Also a significant difference was observed between the total satisfaction score and the hearing aid model. With respect to the analysis of satisfaction with the hearing aid and its style, cost and services was the only subscale which showed a significant difference (P=0.005).CONCLUSION: Respondents using hearing aids with different technology and style were estimated to be quite satisfied. Training audiologists in using more appropriate and fitting hearing aids in addition to using self-reporting questionnaires like SADL for estimating patients' social condition and participation in their life can essentially change their disability condition and countervail their hearing loss."

"27094053","Satisfaction and compliance of adult patients using hearing aid and evaluation of factors affecting them.","The aims of this study are to reveal patient compliance and satisfaction in hearing aid-prescribed adult population and to determine the relevant clinical factors. The study was designed retrospectively, and those patients who have been using hearing aid for at least 6months were invited for evaluation. Demographical data, hearing aid type (digital vs analog), general satisfaction, and daily usage time were asked. Then, the Hearing Aid Satisfaction Questionnaire (HASQ) was applied to all patients which included visual analog scale (VAS)-based 10 questions about the effects of hearing aid on social communication, efficiency, cosmetics, life quality and cost. Totally 400 patients were included in the study. The HASQ was confirmed to be highly reliable by &quot;Kaiser Meyer Olkin and Bartlett Sphericity&quot; tests after exclusion of aid-cost question. There was a negative correlation between age and satisfaction, and a positive correlation between hearing aid usage time (years) and satisfaction (p&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference between mean HASQ scores regarding gender, employment status, hearing aid type and the site of hearing aid wearing. HASQ scores were significantly worse in pure sensorineural loss type, lower educational status, shorter daily usage time, but better in higher pure tone threshold levels (p&lt;0.05). Age, time of hearing aid usage daily, type of hearing impairment, the threshold of hearing and education were the factors affecting satisfaction. Regular daily usage of hearing aid should be encouraged in patients, since by this way aid usage and satisfaction may be improved."
"29209852","Clinical predictors for satisfaction with incus vibroplasty: a preliminary study.","OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the subjective satisfaction after incus vibroplasty and to determine predictive factors affecting patient satisfaction in sensorineural hearing loss.DESIGN: A retrospective review of audiological data and an additional survey about subjective satisfaction after surgery were performed in 14 patients who underwent incus vibroplasty surgery. A numeric rating scale reflecting the degree of satisfaction after incus vibroplasty, compared with experiences using a conventional hearing aid, was used. Patients who showed median or better satisfaction were deemed the highly satisfied (HS) group, and the others were deemed the less satisfied (LS) group. To find the predictive factors correlated with satisfaction for incus vibroplasty, comparative analysis between two groups was performed.RESULTS: We found that the numeric rating scale for satisfaction was variable, ranged from 0 to 10, and was negatively correlated with age at operation (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01). The HS group had a younger age (27.6<U+2009><U+2009>22.2years) and better preoperative air conduction threshold at 250Hz (20.7<U+2009><U+2009>7.9dB) than the LS group (68.0<U+2009><U+2009>9.7years, 32.1<U+2009><U+2009>10.7dB). The LS group (13.6<U+2009><U+2009>9.9dB) showed a larger change of air-bone gap after surgery than the HS group (5.7<U+2009><U+2009>6.7dB) at 250 Hz (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.12).CONCLUSIONS: Age at operation and the preoperative air conduction threshold level at 250Hz appear to be potential predictive factors for subjective satisfaction with incus vibroplasty. Furthermore, more conservative selection of candidates and caution during surgery, considering inevitable air-bone gap development postoperatively, may be necessary to achieve higher satisfaction for incus vibroplasty."
"29130441","Is the Device-Oriented Subjective Outcome (DOSO) Independent of Personality?","BACKGROUND: Self-report questionnaires are a frequently used method of evaluating hearing aid outcomes. Studies have shown that personality can account for 5-20% of the variance in response to self-report measures. As a result, these influences can impact results and limit their generalizability when the purpose of the study is to examine the technological merit of hearing aids. To reduce personality influences on self-report outcome data, the Device-Oriented Subjective Outcome (DOSO) was developed. The DOSO is meant to demonstrate outcomes of the amplification device relatively independent of the individual's personality. Still, it is unknown if the DOSO achieves its original goal.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between personality and the DOSO. The relationship between personality and several widely used hearing-related questionnaires was also examined.RESEARCH DESIGN: This is a nonexperimental study using a correlational design.STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 119 adult hearing aid wearers participated in the study.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The NEO Five-Factor Inventory was used to measure five personality traits (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness). The initial (unaided) hearing disablement, residual (aided) hearing disablement, and hearing aid benefit and satisfaction was measured using the DOSO, Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly/Adult, Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit, and Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life. The relationship between personality and each questionnaire was examined using a correlation analysis.RESULTS: All of the DOSO subscales were found to be significantly correlated to personality, regardless of whether age and better-ear hearing thresholds were controlled. Individuals who reported poorer hearing aid outcomes tended to have higher Neuroticism scores, while those who scored higher in Extraversion, Openness, and Agreeableness were more likely to report better outcomes. Across DOSO subscales, the maximum variance explained by personality traits ranged from 6% to 11%. Consistent with the literature, ~3-18% of the variance of other hearing-related questionnaires was attributable to personality.CONCLUSIONS: The degree to which personality affects the DOSO is similar to other hearing-related questionnaires. Although the variance accounted for by personality is not large, researchers and clinicians should not assume that the results of the DOSO are independent of personality."

Hearing aid adoption overall increased from 33% to 37%, and bilateral use increased from 55% to 69%. Intervals between hearing aid renewals decreased. These factors contribute to increased hearing aid sales. Bilateral users are more satisfied with the hearing aid product features (76%) and performance (72%) and use their hearing aids 9.1 hr per day, compared with unilateral users where the corresponding numbers are 71%, 67%, and 7.8 hr, respectively. Satisfaction with hearing aid product features and performance in general is slightly increasing; hearing aid users are 14.5% less exhausted at the end of the day compared with nonusers with similar hearing loss and exhibit less depressive and forgetfulness symptoms.</AbstractText>: Hearing loss prevalence was stable over the period around 10%-slightly higher for men than for women.

"28590898","Tinnitus Management: Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Extended-Wear Hearing Aids, Conventional Hearing Aids, and Combination Instruments.","BACKGROUND: Whereas hearing aids have long been considered effective for providing relief from tinnitus, controlled clinical studies evaluating this premise have been very limited.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to systematically determine the relative efficacy of conventional receiver-in-the-canal hearing aids (HA), the same hearing aids with a sound generator (HA+SG), and extended-wear, deep fit hearing aids (EWHA), to provide relief from tinnitus through a randomized controlled trial. Each of these ear-level devices was a product of Phonak, LLC.RESEARCH DESIGN: Participants were randomized to HA, HA+SG, or EWHA and wore bilaterally fit devices for about 4 months. Fittings, adjustments, and follow-up appointments were conducted to comply with company guidelines and to ensure that all participants attended appointments on the same schedule. At 4-5 months, participants returned to complete final outcome measures, which concluded their study participation.STUDY SAMPLE: Participants were 55 individuals (mean age: 63.1 years) with mild to moderately-severe hearing loss who: (a) did not currently use hearing aids; (b) reported tinnitus that was sufficiently bothersome to warrant intervention; and (c) were suitable candidates for each of the study devices.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The primary outcome measure was the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI). Secondary outcome measures included hearing-specific questionnaires and the Quick Speech in Noise test (QuickSIN). The goal of the analysis was to evaluate efficacy of the EWHA and HA+SG devices versus the HA standard device.RESULTS: There were 18 participants in each of the HA and EWHA groups and 19 in the HA+SG group. Gender, age, and baseline TFI severity were balanced across treatment groups. Nearly all participants had a reduction in tinnitus symptoms during the study. The average TFI change (improvement) from baseline was 21 points in the HA group, 31 points in the EWHA group, and 33 points in the HA+SG group. A &quot;clinically significant&quot; improvement in reaction to tinnitus (at least 13-point reduction in TFI score) was seen by 67% of HA, 82% of EWHA, and 79% of HA+SG participants. There were no statistically significant differences in the extent to which the devices reduced TFI scores. Likewise, the hearing-specific questionnaires and QuickSIN showed improvements following use of the hearing aids but these improvements did not differ across device groups.CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to conclude that any of these devices offers greater relief from tinnitus than any other one tested. However, all devices appear to offer some improvement in the functional effects of tinnitus."
"28553093","Applications of direct-to-consumer hearing devices for adults with hearing loss: a review.","BACKGROUND: This systematic literature review is aimed at investigating applications of direct-to-consumer hearing devices for adults with hearing loss. This review discusses three categories of direct-to-consumer hearing devices: 1) personal sound amplification products (PSAPs), 2) direct-mail hearing aids, and 3) over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids.METHOD: A literature review was conducted using EBSCOhost and included the databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. After applying prior agreed inclusion and exclusion criteria, 13 reports were included in the review.RESULTS: Included studies fell into three domains: 1) electroacoustic characteristics, 2) consumer surveys, and 3) outcome evaluations. Electroacoustic characteristics of these devices vary significantly with some meeting the stringent acoustic criteria used for hearing aids, while others producing dangerous output levels (ie, over 120-dB sound pressure level). Low-end (or low-cost) devices were typically poor in acoustic quality and did not meet gain levels necessary for most adult and elderly hearing loss patterns (eg, presbycusis), especially in high frequencies. Despite direct-mail hearing aids and PSAPs being associated with lower satisfaction when compared to hearing aids purchased through hearing health care professionals, consumer surveys suggest that 5%-19% of people with hearing loss purchase hearing aids through direct-mail or online. Studies on outcome evaluation suggest positive outcomes of OTC devices in the elderly population. Of note, OTC outcomes appear better when a hearing health care professional supports these users.CONCLUSION: While some direct-to-consumer hearing devices have the capability to produce adverse effects due to production of dangerously high sound levels and internal noise, the existing literature suggests that there are potential benefits of these devices. Research of direct-to-consumer hearing devices is limited, and current published studies are of weak quality. Much effort is needed to understand the benefits and limitations of such devices on people with hearing loss."

The objective of this study is to validate the scale for European Portuguese speakers, by means of translation and cultural adaptation of the questionnaire. The study includes an evaluation of reproducibility and a description of the results of the administration of the questionnaire to patients fitted with hearing aids.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We invited 147 individuals fitted with hearing aids (uni- or bilateral) to participate in the study. Participants had used a hearing aid for at least six weeks and were patients of the Department of Otolaryngology at the Egas Moniz Hospital (Lisbon). The consent as well the guidelines for translation from and into the English language were obtained from the author of the scale, and the translation from and into, and cultural adaptation were carried out, along with an evaluation of reproducibility and internal consistency.RESULTS: The participants were 54% male and 46% female, aged between 16 and 93 (66.09  17.41 years). The results of the study showed an overall level of satisfaction of 5.4 among hearing aids users. The sub-scale satisfaction levels were: positive effects 5.88, service and cost 5.25, negative effects 4.24, and self-image 5.57. The Cronbach a score was 0.75 which indicates good internal consistency. Furthermore, the questionnaire's overall and sub-scale average scores did not differ significantly from the results obtained under the American scale. The inter-examiner reproducibility was also good.DISCUSSION: This study provides reliable results of the scale for the Portuguese of Portugal and adequate internal consistency, with significant age variability in the sample.CONCLUSION: This adaptation of the Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life questionnaire for European Portuguese speakers should be considered a good tool for evaluation of the level of satisfaction of hearing aid users, and until now, is the only available scale for speakers of European Portuguese.Introduo: O questionrio Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life (Satisfao com a Amplificao no Dia-a-Dia) consiste numaescala simples e de rpida aplicao para avaliar a adaptao dos indivduos que utilizam prteses auditivas.

"29572201","Investigating the Impact of Hearing Aid Use and Auditory Training on Cognition, Depressive Symptoms, and Social Interaction in Adults With Hearing Loss: Protocol for a Crossover Trial.","BACKGROUND: Sensorineural hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit among older adults. Some of the psychosocial consequences of this condition include difficulty in understanding speech, depression, and social isolation. Studies have shown that older adults with hearing loss show some age-related cognitive decline. Hearing aids have been proven as successful interventions to alleviate sensorineural hearing loss. In addition to hearing aid use, the positive effects of auditory training-formal listening activities designed to optimize speech perception-are now being documented among adults with hearing loss who use hearing aids, especially new hearing aid users. Auditory training has also been shown to produce prolonged cognitive performance improvements. However, there is still little evidence to support the benefits of simultaneous hearing aid use and individualized face-to-face auditory training on cognitive performance in adults with hearing loss.OBJECTIVE: This study will investigate whether using hearing aids for the first time will improve the impact of individualized face-to-face auditory training on cognition, depression, and social interaction for adults with sensorineural hearing loss. The rationale for this study is based on the hypothesis that, in adults with sensorineural hearing loss, using hearing aids for the first time in combination with individualized face-to-face auditory training will be more effective for improving cognition, depressive symptoms, and social interaction rather than auditory training on its own.METHODS: This is a crossover trial targeting 40 men and women between 50 and 90 years of age with either mild or moderate symmetric sensorineural hearing loss. Consented, willing participants will be recruited from either an independent living accommodation or via a community database to undergo a 6-month intensive face-to-face auditory training program (active control). Participants will be assigned in random order to receive hearing aid (intervention) for either the first 3 or last 3 months of the 6-month auditory training program. Each participant will be tested at baseline, 3, and 6 months using a neuropsychological battery of computer-based cognitive assessments, together with a depression symptom instrument and a social interaction measure. The primary outcome will be cognitive performance with regard to spatial working memory. Secondary outcome measures include other cognition performance measures, depressive symptoms, social interaction, and hearing satisfaction.RESULTS: Data analysis is currently under way and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication in June 2018.CONCLUSIONS: Results from the study will inform strategies for aural rehabilitation, hearing aid delivery, and future hearing loss intervention trials.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03112850; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03112850 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6xz12fD0B)."
"29304553","Hearing impairment and hearing aid usage in Singapore.","OBJECTIVE: To examine the epidemiological and audiological profile, pattern of hearing aid (HA) fitting and usage among HA users in Singapore.DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study.STUDY SAMPLE: Cohort of 1068 subjects issued with HAs at a tertiary hospital between 2001 and 2013.RESULTS: Mean age was 70<U+2009>years with 50.8% male. Mean hearing loss (HL) was 63.1<U+2009>dB and 69.5% had at least moderate-severe HL. Sensorineural HL was present in 66.4% and 69.8% had symmetrical HL. &quot;Behind-the-Ear&quot; HAs were cheaper than &quot;In-Ear&quot; HAs. Standard &quot;Behind-The-Ear&quot; HAs were also cheaper than &quot;Receiver-in-Canal&quot; HAs. Among In-Ear HAs, &quot;In-the-Canal&quot; and &quot;Completely-in-Canal&quot; were more popular than &quot;In-the-Ear&quot; HAs despite costing more. HA was used =4<U+2009>days/week by 85.6% but &gt;7<U+2009>h per day by only 35.7%. Only 18% received bilateral first HA fitting. In multivariate analysis, younger age and symmetrical HL were predictors of bilateral HA uptake while better Pure-Tone-Audiometry of aided ear and &gt;7<U+2009>h of daily HA usage were predictors of successive HA fitting.CONCLUSIONS: HA users in Singapore were elderly and presented with advanced HL. Bilateral HA adoption and average daily use were low compared to other developed countries. Future research on understanding the suboptimal HA usage should explore patients' motivation, hearing disability, and HA effectiveness."
