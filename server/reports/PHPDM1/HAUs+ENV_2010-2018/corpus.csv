"20619332","Acoustic stimulation treatments against tinnitus could be most effective when tinnitus pitch is within the stimulated frequency range.","Acoustic stimulation with hearing aids or noise devices is frequently used in tinnitus therapy. However, such behind-the-ear devices are limited in their high-frequency output with an upper cut-off frequency of approximately 5-6 kHz. Theoretical modeling suggests that acoustic stimulation treatments with these devices might be most effective when the tinnitus pitch is within the stimulated frequency range. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a pilot study with 15 subjects with chronic tinnitus. Eleven subjects received hearing aids and four subjects noise devices. Perceived tinnitus loudness was measured using a visual analog scale, and tinnitus-related distress was assessed using the Tinnitus Questionnaire. After six months of device usage, reductions of perceived tinnitus loudness were seen only in subjects with a tinnitus pitch of less than 6 kHz. When subjects were grouped by tinnitus pitch, the group of patients with a tinnitus pitch of less than 6 kHz (n = 10 subjects) showed a significant reduction in perceived tinnitus loudness (from 73.4 +/- 6.1 before to 56.4 +/- 7.4 after treatment, p = 0.012), whereas in subjects with a tinnitus pitch of 6 kHz or more (n = 5 subjects) tinnitus loudness was slightly increased after six months of treatment (65.0 +/- 4.7 before and 70.6 +/- 5.9 after treatment), but the increase was not significant (p = 0.063). Likewise, tinnitus-related distress was significantly decreased in the low-pitch group (from 31.6 +/- 4.3 to 20.9 +/- 4.8, p = 0.0059), but not in the group with high-pitched tinnitus (30.2 +/- 3.3 before and 30.0 +/- 5.1 after treatment, p = 1). Overall, reductions in tinnitus-related distress in our study were less pronounced than those reported for more comprehensive treatments. However, the differences we observed between the low- and the high-pitch group show that tinnitus pitch might influence the outcome of acoustic stimulation treatments when devices with a limited frequency range are used."
"21864473","Hearing aids in the real world: use of multimemory and volume controls.","BACKGROUND: Despite advances in technology, hearing aid users continue to express a desire for some control over their devices. Access to a suitable control can significantly affect overall satisfaction with amplification, yet little is known about the circumstances that drive hearing aid users to manipulate controls. Such information would be useful in guiding clinical decisions about the selection of controls and synchronization of their operation in a bilateral pair of hearing aids.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the real-world use of multimemory (MM) and volume (VC) controls and environmental characteristics that may influence their use.RESEARCH DESIGN: Real-time data about MM and VC usage were gathered in the real world. Subjective reports of the environmental characteristics were obtained. This design allowed examination of the nature of hearing aid adjustments as well as exploration of factors affecting them.STUDY SAMPLE: Ten adults with bilaterally symmetric, mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss participated in the study. All had previous experience with hearing aids.INTERVENTION: Participants were fitted bilaterally with BTE (behind-the-ear) hearing aids equipped with an MM button and/or VC wheel. The devices were connected to a PDA (personal digital assistant) that logged data from the hearing aids and stored surveys completed by participants in various listening situations.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The following data were obtained from the PDA: (1) MM and VC settings in the left and right devices, (2) broadband input level at the microphone of the left and right devices, and (3) participant reports of the presence, distance, and location of signal and background noise. Prevalence of nondefault settings and bilateral symmetry of hearing aid adjustments were summarized descriptively, while the influence of environmental characteristics on hearing aid adjustments was analyzed using nonparametric methods.RESULTS: Over 4-5 wk, 912 hr of data were logged and 184 surveys completed. Results showed that (1) the default (i.e., the programmed or &quot;use&quot;) setting was preferred most often, (2) the preferred hearing aid settings were mostly bilaterally symmetrical, and (3) nondefault settings were often used in difficult listening situations.CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study generally support the use of synchronized MMs and/or VCs, although there may be exceptions to their utility."
"22642311","Evaluation of model-based versus non-parametric monaural noise-reduction approaches for hearing aids.","OBJECTIVE: Single channel noise reduction has been well investigated and seems to have reached its limits in terms of speech intelligibility improvement, however, the quality of such schemes can still be advanced. This study tests to what extent novel model-based processing schemes might improve performance in particular for non-stationary noise conditions.DESIGN: Two prototype model-based algorithms, a speech-model-based, and a auditory-model-based algorithm were compared to a state-of-the-art non-parametric minimum statistics algorithm. A speech intelligibility test, preference rating, and listening effort scaling were performed. Additionally, three objective quality measures for the signal, background, and overall distortions were applied. For a better comparison of all algorithms, particular attention was given to the usage of the similar Wiener-based gain rule.STUDY SAMPLE: The perceptual investigation was performed with fourteen hearing-impaired subjects.RESULTS: The results revealed that the non-parametric algorithm and the auditory model-based algorithm did not affect speech intelligibility, whereas the speech-model-based algorithm slightly decreased intelligibility. In terms of subjective quality, both model-based algorithms perform better than the unprocessed condition and the reference in particular for highly non-stationary noise environments.CONCLUSION: Data support the hypothesis that model-based algorithms are promising for improving performance in non-stationary noise conditions."
"23367105","Order selection of the hearing aid Feedback Canceller filter based on its impulse response energy.","Numerous methods have been proposed to cancel the unpleasant effects of acoustic feedback between the loudspeaker and microphone in hearing aid systems. Adaptive Feedback Cancellation (AFC) methods are often used to estimate an FIR filter for cancelling the feedback path effect. In estimating the AFC FIR filter, it is important to select the order of the filter properly; especially when the feedback path changes from one environment to another and no knowledge about it is available. Choosing improper filter order causes deficient system performance or excessive computations and power usage in the system. We present tracking of the energy of AFC FIR filters and its convergence behavior as a new criterion for determining the proper order for AFC FIR filter. Experimental results show validity of the proposed criterion."
"26449672","[Hearing aid fitting: Effect of doubling the standard rate on compliance, quality of results, and excess payments].","BACKGROUND: This study investigates the effect that doubling the standard rate for hearing aid fitting which is covered by statutory insurance has had on the size of excess payments and compliance, as well as on benefits for patients and their satisfaction.METHODS: In April 2014, 859 members of a statutory insurance scheme (hkk) who received hearing aids in the 6 months prior to the reform were questioned on the timing and financial details of their hearing aid fitting, as well as on treatment compliance and quality of the results using a standardized questionnaire. In October 2014, the same questionnaire was used to collect these data from a further 622 insurance holders who had received hearing aids in the 8 months following introduction of the new regulation. Most of the questions concerning hearing quality corresponded to those of the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) questionnaire.RESULTS: The project revealed a statistically significant decrease of 6 percent points in the proportion of hearing aid users who had to pay any excess whatsoever; from 80.6% to 74.1%. However, 40% of the insured persons continued to pay an excess of 1000 euros and more. The subjective hearing quality remained practically unimproved by the reform and was statistically, almost without exception, independent of whether hearing aid users wore expensive devices associated with a large excess, or devices available at the standard rate. Finally, the study confirmed a previously recognized usage pattern characterized by noncompliance. For example, approximately 40% of hearing aid users did not wear their device in the everyday environment. This observation was independent of the size of the excess and the timing of the most recent visit to the hearing aid acoustician.CONCLUSION: Despite doubling of the standard rate, three quarters of patients pay an excess--sometimes a substantial one. The subjective hearing quality was not improved by doubling the standard rate; the majority of patients continue to complain of considerable problems with hearing in difficult situations (environments with background or reverberant noise). Satisfaction with hearing quality is neither dependent on the doubling of the standard rate, nor on whether or not an excess was paid. Compliance may possibly be improved by structured follow-up, which should involve the prescribing otorhinolaryngologists, as well as phoniatrists, pedaudiologists, and hearing aid acousticians."
"25634777","Hearing aid and hearing assistance technology use in Aotearoa/New Zealand.","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe factors that are related to hearing aid and hearing assistance technology ownership and use in Aotearoa/New Zealand.DESIGN: Adults with hearing impairment living in New Zealand were surveyed regarding health-related quality of life and device usage. Audiometric data (hearing sensitivity and speech in noise) were collected.STUDY SAMPLE: Data were obtained from 123 adults with hearing impairment: 73 reported current hearing-aid use, 81 reported current hearing assistance technology use.RESULTS: In both analyses, device users had more difficulty understanding speech in background noise, had poor hearing in both their better and worse hearing ears, and perceived more consequences of hearing impairment in their everyday lives (both emotionally and socially) than non-hearing-aid users. Discriminant analyses showed that the social consequences of hearing impairment and the better ear hearing best classified hearing aid users from non-users but social consequences and worse ear hearing best classified hearing assistance technology users from non-users.CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life measurements and speech-in-noise assessments provide useful clinical information. Hearing-impaired adults in New Zealand who use hearing aids also tend to use hearing assistance technology, which has important clinical implications."
