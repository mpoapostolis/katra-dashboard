"21090162","Tinnitus sound therapy with open ear canal hearing aids.","OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of open ear canal hearing aids in tinnitus treatment and to investigate the influence of gender, age, medication usage, tinnitus cause, tinnitus perception side, tinnitus pitch, pure tone audiometry, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, and minimal masking level on outcome.METHODOLOGY: One hundred tinnitus patients were evaluated by the tinnitus handicap inventory (THI) at the beginning of the study and after nine months of treatment. All subjects were submitted to counselling and sound enrichment from the simple sound amplification provided by the open ear canal hearing aids.RESULTS: Initial mean THI score was 54.22 (+/- 20.37) and final mean score was 28.32 (+/- 16.50), p &lt; 0.0001. No statistically significant correlations were found between THI value reduction and the studied parameters.CONCLUSION: Open ear canal hearing aids were useful in all tinnitus patients with mild hearing loss."
"20046416","Hearing threshold of Korean adolescents associated with the use of personal music players.","PURPOSE: Hearing loss can lead to a number of disabilities and can reduce quality of life. Noise-induced hearing losses have become more common among adolescents due to increased exposure to personal music players. We, therefore, investigated the use of personal music player among Korean adolescents and the relationship between hearing threshold and usage pattern of portable music players.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 490 adolescents were interviewed personally regarding their use of portable music players, including the time and type of player and the type of headphone used. Pure tone audiometry was performed in each subject.RESULTS: Of the 490 subjects, 462 (94.3%) used personal music players and most of them have used the personal music player for 1-3 hours per day during 1-3 years. The most common type of portable music player was the MP3 player, and the most common type of headphone was the earphone (insert type). Significant elevations of hearing threshold were observed in males, in adolescents who had used portable music players for over 5 years, for those over 15 years in cumulative period and in those who had used earphones.CONCLUSION: Portable music players can have a deleterious effect on hearing threshold in adolescents. To preserve hearing, adolescents should avoid using portable music players for long periods of time and should avoid using earphones."
"21795978","Gender and hearing aids: patterns of use and determinants of nonregular use.","OBJECTIVE: Research addressing gender and hearing has focused mainly on differences in the auditory systems of men and women, communication, and psychological issues. Differences between men and women in the use of hearing aids are less clear. To date, no study has examined the effects of gender on hearing aid use as a primary aim. However, use patterns and underlying reasons for not using hearing aids may differ between men and women, or there might be a gender difference in the impact of some determinants on hearing aid use. A consideration of such factors could increase hearing aid use. Therefore, the aim of the present investigation was to provide information about gender-related influences on hearing aid use by examining differences in usage patterns and determinants of nonregular use.DESIGN: This study used cross-sectional survey data from 4979 adult male and 3410 adult female hearing aid owners in Switzerland in 2005. The survey data, including self-reported hearing aid use, were matched to the hearing loss data and the hearing aid technical information. Descriptive analyses were performed for the use patterns, age at first fitting, and audiogram slope. The determinants of nonregular use were examined using logistic regression models that were stratified by gender.RESULTS: Compared with men, women reported a higher prevalence of daily and regular use and a longer daily duration of use of hearing aids. Men more commonly indicated a limited benefit as a reason for nonregular use. The multivariate analyses showed that nonregular use was significantly less likely in women. The audiogram slope strongly contributed to this difference. Stratified analyses showed that for both men and women, poor handling and low satisfaction were associated with a higher likelihood for nonregular hearing aid use. Associations were discrepant for asymmetric hearing loss, which was a risk factor in women but a protective factor in men. Higher risks of nonregular use were found in men with steeper audiogram slopes and longer durations of ownership of their current aids, in women fitted with their first aid in the previous 2 to 5 yr, and in women older than 65 yr.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the present study provides evidence of gender-specific factors that influence hearing aid use patterns in men and women and of groups at higher risk for nonregular hearing aid use. Men with steeper audiogram slopes and the other subgroups of men and women with an increased risk for nonregular use should given particular attention when fitting their aids. As common risk factors for nonregular use, poor handling and low satisfaction should be addressed during the fitting process for all users. Further research is needed to clarify the differential influence of asymmetric hearing loss on hearing aid use in men and women. This information could improve hearing aid use and should be incorporated into daily clinical practice."
"23659867","Internet access and use in adults with hearing loss.","BACKGROUND: The future rehabilitation of adults with hearing loss is likely to involve online tools used by individuals at home. Online tools could also be useful for people who are not seeking professional help for their hearing problems. Hearing impairment is a disability that increases with age, and increased age is still associated with reduced use of the Internet. Therefore, to continue the research on online audiological rehabilitative tools for people with hearing loss, it is important to determine if and to what extent adults with hearing loss use the Internet.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of the Internet and email in a group of adults with hearing loss and to investigate if their use of Internet and email differed between genders, among different age groups, and how it compared with the general population in Sweden.METHODS: Questionnaires containing multiple-choice questions about Internet access, email use, and educational level were mailed to individuals with hearing loss, who were registered as patients at a hearing aid clinic. Out of the 269 invited participants, 158 returned a completed questionnaire, which was a response rate of 58.7%.RESULTS: The results showed that 60% (94/158) of the participants with hearing loss used computers and the Internet. The degree of hearing loss in the group of participants did not explain the level of Internet usage, while factors of age, gender, and education did (P&lt;.001). More men than women used the Internet (OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.32-4.91, P&lt;.001). Use of the Internet was higher in the youngest age group (25-64 years) compared to the oldest age group (75-96 years, P=.001). A higher usage of the Internet was observed in the participants with hearing loss, especially the elderly, when compared with the general population of Sweden (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.23-3.17, P=.04).CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the use of computers and the Internet overall is at least at the same level for people with hearing loss as for the general age-matched population in Sweden, but that this use is even higher in specific age groups. These results are important for the future work in developing and evaluating rehabilitative educational online tools for adults with hearing loss."
"25538617","The effect of functional hearing loss and age on long- and short-term visuospatial memory: evidence from the UK biobank resource.","The UK Biobank offers cross-sectional epidemiological data collected on &gt;500,000 individuals in the UK between 40 and 70 years of age. Using the UK Biobank data, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of functional hearing loss and hearing aid usage on visuospatial memory function. This selection of variables resulted in a sub-sample of 138,098 participants after discarding extreme values. A digit triplets functional hearing test was used to divide the participants into three groups: poor, insufficient and normal hearers. We found negative relationships between functional hearing loss and both visuospatial working memory (i.e., a card pair matching task) and visuospatial, episodic long-term memory (i.e., a prospective memory task), with the strongest association for episodic long-term memory. The use of hearing aids showed a small positive effect for working memory performance for the poor hearers, but did not have any influence on episodic long-term memory. Age also showed strong main effects for both memory tasks and interacted with gender and education for the long-term memory task. Broader theoretical implications based on a memory systems approach will be discussed and compared to theoretical alternatives. "
"25262621","Structural alterations of brain grey and white matter in early deaf adults.","Functional and structural brain alterations in the absence of the auditory input have been described, but the observed structural brain changes in the deaf are not uniform. Some of the previous researchers focused only on the auditory areas, while others investigated the whole brain or other selected regions of interest. Majority of studies revealed decreased white matter (WM) volume or altered WM microstructure and preserved grey matter (GM) structure of the auditory areas in the deaf. However, preserved WM and increased or decreased GM volume of the auditory areas in the deaf have also been reported. Several structural alterations in the deaf were found also outside the auditory areas, but these regions differ between the studies. The observed differences between the studies could be due to the use of different single-analysis techniques, or the diverse population sample and its size, or possibly due to the usage of hearing aids by some participating deaf subjects. To overcome the aforementioned limitations four different image-processing techniques were used to investigate changes in the brain morphology of prelingually deaf adults who have never used hearing aids. GM and WM volume of the Heschl's gyrus (HG) were measured using manual volumetry, while whole brain GM volume, thickness and surface area were assessed by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and surface-based analysis. The microstructural properties of the WM were evaluated by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The data were compared between 14 congenitally deaf adults and 14 sex- and age-matched normal hearing controls. Manual volumetry revealed preserved GM volume of the bilateral HG and significantly decreased WM volume of the left HG in the deaf. VBM showed increased cerebellar GM volume in the deaf, while no statistically significant differences were observed in the GM thickness or surface area between the groups. The results of the DTI analysis showed WM microstructural alterations between the groups in the bilateral auditory areas, including the superior temporal gyrus, the HG, the planum temporale and the planum polare, which were more extensive in the right hemisphere. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was significantly reduced in the right and axial diffusivity (AD) in the left auditory areas in the deaf. FA and AD were significantly reduced also in several other brain areas outside the auditory cortex in the deaf. The use of four different methods used in our study, although showing changes that are not directly related, provides additional information and supports the conclusion that in prelingually deaf subjects structural alterations are present both in the auditory areas and elsewhere. Our results support the findings of those studies showing that early deafness results in decreased WM volume and microstructural WM alterations in the auditory areas. As we observed WM microstructural alteration also in several other areas and increased GM volume in the cerebellum in the deaf, we can conclude that early deafness results in widespread structural brain changes. These probably reflect atrophy or degradation as well as compensatory cross-modal reorganisation in the absence of the auditory input and the use of the sign language. "
"26244401","The Effect of Functional Hearing and Hearing Aid Usage on Verbal Reasoning in a Large Community-Dwelling Population.","OBJECTIVES: Verbal reasoning performance is an indicator of the ability to think constructively in everyday life and relies on both crystallized and fluid intelligence. This study aimed to determine the effect of functional hearing on verbal reasoning when controlling for age, gender, and education. In addition, the study investigated whether hearing aid usage mitigated the effect and examined different routes from hearing to verbal reasoning.DESIGN: Cross-sectional data on 40- to 70-year-old community-dwelling participants from the UK Biobank resource were accessed. Data consisted of behavioral and subjective measures of functional hearing, assessments of numerical and linguistic verbal reasoning, measures of executive function, and demographic and lifestyle information. Data on 119,093 participants who had completed hearing and verbal reasoning tests were submitted to multiple regression analyses, and data on 61,688 of these participants, who had completed additional cognitive tests and provided relevant lifestyle information, were submitted to structural equation modeling.RESULTS: Poorer performance on the behavioral measure of functional hearing was significantly associated with poorer verbal reasoning in both the numerical and linguistic domains (p &lt; 0.001). There was no association between the subjective measure of functional hearing and verbal reasoning. Functional hearing significantly interacted with education (p &lt; 0.002), showing a trend for functional hearing to have a greater impact on verbal reasoning among those with a higher level of formal education. Among those with poor hearing, hearing aid usage had a significant positive, but not necessarily causal, effect on both numerical and linguistic verbal reasoning (p &lt; 0.005). The estimated effect of hearing aid usage was less than the effect of poor functional hearing. Structural equation modeling analyses confirmed that controlling for education reduced the effect of functional hearing on verbal reasoning and showed that controlling for executive function eliminated the effect. However, when computer usage was controlled for, the eliminating effect of executive function was weakened.CONCLUSIONS: Poor functional hearing was associated with poor verbal reasoning in a 40- to 70-year-old community-dwelling population after controlling for age, gender, and education. The effect of functional hearing on verbal reasoning was significantly reduced among hearing aid users and completely overcome by good executive function skills, which may be enhanced by playing computer games."
"26070470","On the relationship between functional hearing and depression.","OBJECTIVE: To establish the effect of self-rated and measured functional hearing on depression, taking age and gender into account. Additionally, the study investigates if hearing-aid usage mitigates the effect, and if other physical health problems and social engagement confound it.DESIGN: Cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank resource, including subjective and behavioural measures of functional hearing and multifactorial measures of depressive episodes and symptoms, were accessed and analysed using multi-regression analyses.STUDY SAMPLE: Over 100 000 community-dwelling, 39-70 year-old volunteers.RESULTS: Irrespective of measurement method, poor functional hearing was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) associated with higher levels of depressive episodes (= 0.16 factor scores) and depressive symptoms (= 0.30 factor scores) when controlling for age and gender. Associations were stronger for subjective reports, for depressive symptoms, and the younger participants. Females generally reported higher levels of depression. Hearing-aid usage did not show a mitigating effect on the associations. Other physical health problems particularly partially confounded the effects.CONCLUSION: Data support an association between functional hearing and depression that is stronger in the younger participants (40-49 years old) and for milder depression. The association was not alleviated by hearing-aid usage, but was partially confounded by other physical health problems."
"25751692","Case factors affecting hearing aid recommendations by hearing care professionals.","BACKGROUND: Professional recommendations to patients concerning hearing instrument (HI) technology levels are not currently evidence-based. Pre-fitting parameters have not been proven to be the primary indicators for optimal patient outcome with different HI technology levels. This results in subjective decision-making as regards the technology level recommendation made by professionals.PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to gain insight into the decision-making criteria utilized by professionals when recommending HI technology levels to hearing-impaired patients.RESEARCH DESIGN: A set of patient variables (and their respective levels) was identified by professionals as determinant for their recommendation of HIs. An experimental design was developed and 21 representative patient cases were generated. The design was based on a contrastive vignette technique according to which different types of vignettes (patient cases) were randomly presented to respondents in an online survey. Based on these patient cases, professionals were asked in the survey to make a treatment recommendation.STUDY SAMPLE: The online survey was sent to approximately 3,500 professionals from the US, Germany, France, and Italy. The professionals were randomly selected from the databases of Oticon sales companies. The manufacturer sponsoring the survey remained anonymous and was only revealed after completing the survey, if requested by the respondent. The response rate was 20.5%.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data comprised of respondent descriptions and patient case recommendations that were collected from the online survey. A binary logit modeling approach was used to identify the variables that discriminate between the respondents' recommendations of HI technology levels.RESULTS: The results show that HI technology levels are recommended by professionals based on their perception of the patient's activity level in life, the level of HI usage for experienced users, their age, and their speech discrimination score. Surprisingly, the patient's lifestyle as perceived by the hearing care professional, followed by speech discrimination, were the strongest factors in explaining treatment recommendation. An active patient with poor speech discrimination had a 17% chance of being recommended the highest technology level HI. For a very active patient with good speech discrimination, the probability increases to 68%.CONCLUSIONS: The discrepancies in HI technology level recommendations are not justified by academic research or evidence of optimal patient outcome with a different HI technology level. The paradigm of lifestyle as the significant variable identified in this study is apparently deeply anchored in the mindset of the professional despite the lack of supporting evidence. These results call for a shift in the professional's technology level recommendation practice, from nonevidence-based to a proven practice that can maximize patient outcome."
"25634777","Hearing aid and hearing assistance technology use in Aotearoa/New Zealand.","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe factors that are related to hearing aid and hearing assistance technology ownership and use in Aotearoa/New Zealand.DESIGN: Adults with hearing impairment living in New Zealand were surveyed regarding health-related quality of life and device usage. Audiometric data (hearing sensitivity and speech in noise) were collected.STUDY SAMPLE: Data were obtained from 123 adults with hearing impairment: 73 reported current hearing-aid use, 81 reported current hearing assistance technology use.RESULTS: In both analyses, device users had more difficulty understanding speech in background noise, had poor hearing in both their better and worse hearing ears, and perceived more consequences of hearing impairment in their everyday lives (both emotionally and socially) than non-hearing-aid users. Discriminant analyses showed that the social consequences of hearing impairment and the better ear hearing best classified hearing aid users from non-users but social consequences and worse ear hearing best classified hearing assistance technology users from non-users.CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life measurements and speech-in-noise assessments provide useful clinical information. Hearing-impaired adults in New Zealand who use hearing aids also tend to use hearing assistance technology, which has important clinical implications."
"27094053","Satisfaction and compliance of adult patients using hearing aid and evaluation of factors affecting them.","The aims of this study are to reveal patient compliance and satisfaction in hearing aid-prescribed adult population and to determine the relevant clinical factors. The study was designed retrospectively, and those patients who have been using hearing aid for at least 6 months were invited for evaluation. Demographical data, hearing aid type (digital vs analog), general satisfaction, and daily usage time were asked. Then, the Hearing Aid Satisfaction Questionnaire (HASQ) was applied to all patients which included visual analog scale (VAS)-based 10 questions about the effects of hearing aid on social communication, efficiency, cosmetics, life quality and cost. Totally 400 patients were included in the study. The HASQ was confirmed to be highly reliable by &quot;Kaiser Meyer Olkin and Bartlett Sphericity&quot; tests after exclusion of aid-cost question. There was a negative correlation between age and satisfaction, and a positive correlation between hearing aid usage time (years) and satisfaction (p &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference between mean HASQ scores regarding gender, employment status, hearing aid type and the site of hearing aid wearing. HASQ scores were significantly worse in pure sensorineural loss type, lower educational status, shorter daily usage time, but better in higher pure tone threshold levels (p &lt; 0.05). Age, time of hearing aid usage daily, type of hearing impairment, the threshold of hearing and education were the factors affecting satisfaction. Regular daily usage of hearing aid should be encouraged in patients, since by this way aid usage and satisfaction may be improved."
"26862245","The Usage of Association Rule Mining to Identify Influencing Factors on Deafness After Birth.","BACKGROUND: Providing complete and high quality health care services has very important role to enable people to understand the factors related to personal and social health and to make decision regarding choice of suitable healthy behaviors in order to achieve healthy life. For this reason, demographic and clinical data of person are collecting, this huge volume of data can be known as a valuable resource for analyzing, exploring and discovering valuable information and communication. This study using forum rules techniques in the data mining has tried to identify the affecting factors on hearing loss after birth in Iran.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The survey is kind of data oriented study. The population of the study is contained questionnaires in several provinces of the country. First, all data of questionnaire was implemented in the form of information table in Software SQL Server and followed by Data Entry using written software of C # .Net, then algorithm Association in SQL Server Data Tools software and Clementine software was implemented to determine the rules and hidden patterns in the gathered data.FINDINGS: Two factors of number of deaf brothers and the degree of consanguinity of the parents have a significant impact on severity of deafness of individuals. Also, when the severity of hearing loss is greater than or equal to moderately severe hearing loss, people use hearing aids and Men are also less interested in the use of hearing aids.CONCLUSION: In fact, it can be said that in families with consanguineous marriage of parents that are from first degree (girl/boy cousins) and 2(nd) degree relatives (girl/boy cousins) and especially from first degree, the number of people with severe hearing loss or deafness are more and in the use of hearing aids, gender of the patient is more important than the severity of the hearing loss."
"28906244","Hearing Aid Use and Mild Hearing Impairment: Learnings from Big Data.","BACKGROUND: Previous research, mostly reliant on self-reports, has indicated that hearing aid (HA) use is related to the degree of hearing impairment (HI). No large-scale investigation of the relationship between data-logged HA use and HI has been conducted to date.PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate if objective measures of overall daily HA use and HA use in various listening environments are different for adults with mild HI compared to adults with moderate HI.RESEARCH DESIGN: This retrospective study used data extracted from a database of fitting appointments from an international group of HA providers. Only data from the participants' most recent fitting appointment were included in the final dataset.STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 8,489 bilateral HA fittings of adults over the age of 18 yr, conducted between January 2013 and June 2014, were included. Participants were subsequently allocated to HI groups, based on British Society of Audiology and American Speech-Language-Hearing Association audiometric descriptors.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Fitting data from participating HA providers were regularly transferred to a central server. The data, with all personal information except age and gender removed, contained participants' four-frequency average (at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz) as well as information on HA characteristics and usage. Following data cleaning, bivariate and post hoc statistical analyses were conducted.RESULTS: The total sample of adults' average daily HA use was 8.52 hr (interquartile range [IQR] = 5.49-11.77) in the left ear and 8.51 hr (IQR = 5.49-11.72) in the right ear. With a few exceptions, there were no statistical differences between hours of HA use for participants with mild HI compared to those with moderate impairment. Across all mild and moderate HI groups, the most common overall HA usage was between 8 and 12 hr per day. Other factors such as age, gender, and HA style also showed no relationship to hours of use. HAs were used, on average, for 7 hr (IQR = 4.27-9.96) per day in quiet and 1 hr (IQR = 0.33-1.41) per day in noisy listening situations.CONCLUSIONS: Clinical populations with mild HI use HAs as frequently as those with a moderate HI. These findings support the recommendation of HAs for adults with milder degrees of HI."
"29587086","Longitudinal Tracking of Sound Exposure and Hearing Aid Usage through Objective Data Logs.","Objective To use data-logging technology to objectively track and identify predictors of hearing aid (HA) usage and aided sound exposure. Study Design Case series with planned data collection. Setting Tertiary academic medical center. Subjects and Methods Individuals with HAs between 2007 and 2016 were included (N = 431; mean, 74.6 years; 95% CI, 73.1-76.0). Data-logging technology intrinsic to new-generation HAs was enabled to track usage and sound exposure. With multivariable linear regression, age, sex, number of audiology visits, duration of audiologic follow-up, pure tone average, and HA side were assessed as predictors of usage (hours/day) and aided sound exposure (dB-hours/day; ie, &quot;dose&quot; of sound per day). Results Mean follow-up was 319 days (95% CI, 277-360). Mean HA usage was 8.4 hours/day (95% CI, 8.0-8.8; N = 431). Mean aided sound exposure was 440 dB-hours/day (95% CI, 385-493; n = 110). HA use (ß &lt; 0.001, P = .45) and aided sound exposure (ß = -0.006, P = .87) were both stable over time. HA usage was associated only with hearing loss level (pure tone average; ß = 0.030, P = .04). Aided sound exposure was associated only with duration of audiologic follow-up (ß = 0.100, P = .02). Conclusion While measurement of HA use has traditionally relied on subjective reporting, data logging offers an objective tool to longitudinally track HA use and sound exposure. We demonstrate the feasibility of using this potentially powerful research tool. Usage and sound exposure were stable among patients throughout the study period. Use was greater among subjects with greater hearing loss. Maximizing aided sound exposure might be possible through continued audiology follow-up visits."
