"11324843","Using conjoint analysis to examine the importance of hearing aid attributes.","OBJECTIVE: To introduce conjoint analysis (CA) as a method to explain choice decisions of hearing aid users and to measure the contributions of different hearing aid attributes involved.DESIGN: The study was conducted using CA, a method that is well established in marketing, but has not been used for hearing aid research. CA examines the contributions (importance) various attributes make to overall preference judgements. It is based on the premises that objects (i.e., hearing aids) can be described as different combinations of several attributes. The relative importance of the attributes is estimated from integral judgements of hypothetical hearing aids. The advantages of CA are a more realistic presentation of complete products instead of isolated attributes and the consideration of trade-offs between the features. The following attributes selected from 12 features in a prestudy were included in the application: speech perception in quiet, speech perception in noise, handling, sound quality, localization, and feedback. 93 randomly chosen experienced hearing aid wearers participated in the survey.RESULTS: It was found that the attributes concerning speech perception were by far most important. Speech discrimination in quiet and in noise were almost equally significant and contributed with 56% to the preference decisions of the subjects. The remaining attributes showed values in the range of 10% to 12%. When comparing various subgroups dependent on age, sex, hearing loss, satisfaction, etc., significant differences concerning the preferences were found. Elder and female subjects attached greater importance of the attribute &quot;handling&quot; whereas younger patients judged &quot;speech in noise&quot; more important. In general, subjects with greater hearing loss considered speech intelligibility in quiet to be more important than in noisy surroundings. Moreover, sound quality seems to be a significant indicator for satisfaction with the hearing aid.CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes CA as a survey technique to examine individual preferences for hearing aids. Several assumptions about the importance of hearing aid features for different groups of users could be confirmed quantitatively. Segmentation showed valid results depending on socio-demographic and user-specific parameters. The method used and the results are of interest for audiologists as well as the hearing aid industry. They provide valuable tools for future hearing aid design and should be considered in the development of self-assessment inventories."
"11296940","Clinical study of hearing instruments: a cross-sectional longitudinal audit based on consumer experiences.","The objective of the present audit was to document improvements/changes in hearing instrument (HI) benefit in terms of use and satisfaction throughout the 1990s and compare the benefit in consumers fitted with analogue (A), programmable (P), and digital signal processing (DSP) HIs. The audit data are based on a questionnaire mailed to subjects fitted with HIs 3 to 4 months after the fitting, including questions concerning satisfaction with the HI, use of the HI, ability to manage the HI, and satisfaction with the overall services in the department. Information was obtained from 32,694 subjects (i.e., 71.2 per cent of those fitted with HIs throughout the last decade), with a median age at fitting of 78 years (range, 18-102), with a preponderance of females. No significant differences in age, gender distribution, and hearing instrument distribution were found between the respondents and non-respondents. The audit shows that there are no significant differences in any of the benefit parameters throughout the decade, irrespective of the introduction of P-HIs in 1995 and of the DSP-HIs in 1998. Thus, from the consumers' perspective, no changes have appeared in the last decade. A comparative analysis of the A-HIs, P-HIs, and DSP-HIs shows that among those provided with P-HIs and DSP-HIs, only 69.6 per cent (CI 68.1-71.0) and 65.5 per cent (CI 60.2-78.8), respectively, were very satisfied/satisfied with the HI, which is significantly less than the 73.5 per cent (CI 72.4-74.5) in those fitted with A-HIs. The daily/weekly use of all three types of HIs was similar. However, the group fitted with DSP-HIs was significantly less satisfied with the general services compared with those fitted with A-HIs and P-HIs, respectively. Based on these audit data, it is concluded that, according to the consumers, the outcome from HIs has not changed over the last decade, and a comparison between the traditional A-HIs with both P-HIs and DSP-HIs is in favour of the traditional A-HIs."
"11293315","[Users' experiences with modern hearing aids. An audit].","INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to evaluate satisfaction with use and manipulation of hearing aids (HA), and to compare these parameters for analogue (A-HA), programmable (P-HA), and digital signal processing aids (DSP-HA).METHOD: An audit was made of data on users' experiences, as indicated in a questionnaire posted 3-4 months after the HA fitting.MATERIAL: Questionnaires were posted to 18,702 persons, who, during the period 1997-1999, had been provided with a HA at a median age of 77 years (range 18-98), 41.8% of whom were men, and 58.2% women. Responses were returned by 12,866 (68.8%), and, as there were no differences between the respondents and non-respondents with respect to age, gender, and distribution of HA type, the responses were considered representative.RESULTS: According to the replies, 71.5% were very satisfied/satisfied with their HA; 89% used the instrument daily/weekly, and 75% were able to manipulate the HA without problems. However, 10.7-12.7% said they never used the fitted HA. A significantly higher proportion were satisfied with A-HAs as compared to P-HAs and DSP-HAs, whereas there was no significant difference in use as a function of type. A significantly higher number of the users fitted with a DSP-HA could manipulate them, but 36.5% of these needed follow-up in contrast to 25.5% fitted with a P-HA, and 21.6% fitted with an A-HA. A significantly smaller proportion of the elderly were able to manipulate the HA.CONCLUSION: The users of modern HAs are satisfied with them, use them, and most are able to manipulate the HA without problems. The new technology has raised unrealistic expectations in the users, and the DSP-HAs account for larger costs to the national health services, because they are more expensive and the need for staff resources is greater."
"11808724","Personal and social conditions potentially influencing women's hearing loss management.","Little gender-specific data related to hearing loss and hearing loss management are available. The purpose of this investigation was to examine personal and social conditions affecting women at selected stages of the adult life course that may influence hearing loss management. In all, 191 women in three age groups, ranging from 35 to 85 years old, participated. None reported hearing problems. Participants completed a demographic data form and were given a standard audiometric evaluation to confirm age-normal hearing. Each completed assessments of speech understanding in quiet and noise, auditory signal duration discrimination, and binaural processing. Measures of hearing knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes; health-related locus of control; ego strength; and, social support were administered. Results revealed that although some variables deteriorate among subsequent age groups (i.e., hearing thresholds, central auditory processing, and ego strength), the reverse is true for others (i.e., social interaction and satisfaction with income). Age-specific sociodemographic burdens that may interfere with hearing loss management were noted. New psychosocial data are revealed against which women and men with impaired hearing may be compared."
"11766693","Survey of the perceived benefits and shortcomings of a specialist tinnitus clinic.","Questions about the clinical effectiveness of tinnitus services are of considerable interest to health professionals and health care providers alike in view of the chronic nature of tinnitus, the diversity of tinnitus-related problems, and the range of costs of different approaches to the clinical management of tinnitus. This study sought to identify the views of patients with tinnitus, who attended a specialist tinnitus clinic in Wales, about their satisfaction with that service. One hundred and forty-eight patients returned an open-ended mail-out questionnaire that asked them to list the perceived benefits and shortcomings of attendance at the specialist clinic. The respondents were classified as current or very recent attenders (43 per cent) and those who had first attended between 18 to 60 months earlier (57 per cent). Respondents cited an average of 2.8 benefits compared to only 0.8 perceived shortcomings per respondent. Major areas of perceived benefit included technical assistance, in the form of hearing aid or tinnitus masker fitting, and the general therapeutic nature of the consultation(s) with clinic staff. Statistically significant differences were found in some volunteered benefits in relation to gender and patient status as a current or previous attender. More than one-quarter of the respondents (28.4 per cent) stated that there were no shortcomings to their clinic attendance. The main volunteered shortcoming was lack of treatment effectiveness. The study showed that tinnitus clinic attendance resulted in many of the patients' individually expressed complaints being addressed effectively. Further, the study's findings confirmed the effectiveness of the provision of information and counselling as a fundamental form of tinnitus management for a substantial proportion of patients with tinnitus."
"14582640","Examination of differences between successful and unsuccessful elderly hearing aid candidates matched for age, hearing loss and gender.","This study examined group differences on a variety of measures for three groups of elderly hearing aid candidates matched for gender, age and hearing loss. These three groups were: (1) 26 candidates who declined amplification (non-adherents); (2) 24 individuals who purchased hearing aids, but subsequently returned them (rejected HA); and (3) 26 who purchased hearing aids and continued to use their hearing aids for at least the first 6 months following delivery (accepted HA). Following demonstration of adequate reliability for these measures, using the non-adherents as the test retest study sample, group differences were examined for each pre-fit measure. The group of non-adherents who declined amplification differed from the two groups who purchased hearing aids on their scores for the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE) and for several scales of the Communication Profile for the Hearing Impaired (CPHI) that assessed the individual's personal adjustment to hearing impairment. These findings were generally confirmed for the individual data, with the use of discriminant analysis. For the two groups who tried hearing aids, there were no group differences between those who retained them and those who did not. Discriminant analysis, however, indicated that those in the group who retained their (linear) hearing aids tended to have better finger dexterity and higher loudness discomfort levels than those who did not."
"18540375","[Analyses of factors contributing to hearing aids use and both subjective and objective estimates of hearing].","The use of hearing aids, regardless actual implementation, may be interpreted as a cry for help in hearing difficulty. We assessed factors contributing to hearing aid possession and predicted needs of hearing assistance from the distribution of hearing level in self-estimated (subjective) hearing loss and hearing loss pointed out by others (objective) in a population-based aging cohort. Of 1192 men and 1163 women aged 40 to 84 years, the prevalence of hearing loss using the criteria of a mean hearing threshold&gt;25dB at frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz in the better ear was 23.6%. Hearing aids were possessed by 11.0% in the hearing loss group. Statistical analysis by gender was done to identify factors associated with hearing aid possession using stepwise multiple regression in which independent variables were age, hearing in the better and worse ear, and items from response to a questionnaire on self-estimated hearing loss, hearing loss pointed out by others, job, household income, financial satisfaction, education, housemate, how often others were talked to and how often those surveyed went out. Age, better-ear hearing, worse-ear hearing, and education statistically influenced hearing aid possession in men, and age, better-ear hearing, and hearing loss pointed out by others statistically influenced women. Age had a negative effect on hearing aid possession in both men and women, indicating that possession decreased with aging. Scattergrams were plotted with worse-ear hearing on the y axis and better-ear hearing on the x axis for 4 groups of respondents divided into groups with self-estimated hearing loss or hearing loss pointed out by others: (1) no subjective and objective hearing loss, (2) subjective but no objective hearing loss, (3) objective but no subjective hearing loss, and (4) both subjective and objective hearing loss. Many respondents had either subjective or objective or both subjective and objective hearing loss, even within 20 dB of hearing level of both ears in their 40s. These facts implied that early-stage candidates for hearing aids may not require threshold reduction, although aided thresholds were commonly used indicators in fitting."
"19928396","Hearing aid outcomes: effects of gender and experience on patients' use and satisfaction.","PURPOSE: To use the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA) with patients having advanced hearing aid technology to assess their satisfaction and benefit focusing on gender and experience effects, compare to norms, and use the IOI-HA and a practice-specific questionnaire to monitor the quality of the services provided by a dispensing practice.RESEARCH DESIGN: A study of 160 potential participants who had worn their newly purchased multichannel digital hearing aids having directional microphones for at least three months, completed a trial period, and should have had time to acclimatize to them. English-speaking, private or insurance paying, competent, adult patients from a private practice were mailed a 12-item practice-specific questionnaire and the seven-item IOI-HA.RESULTS: Of the 160 questionnaires mailed, 73 were returned for a 46% return rate. Of those, 64 were useable. Participants included male (34) and female (30), new (30) and previous (34) hearing aid users, who self-selected their participation by returning the questionnaires. The practice-specific questionnaire assessed patients' demographics and the quality of services received. The IOI-HA was analyzed according to an overall score and on two different factor scores. A power analysis revealed that 19 respondents per group were needed for the IOI-HA results to have a statistical power of .80 and probability of a Type II error of .20 for detecting a significant difference at the p &lt; 0.05 level. Similar to earlier studies, no significant differences were observed either for any of the main effects or interactions for gender or user experience for the two IOI-HA factors and overall scores. A significant, but weak, positive correlation (r = .34; df = 63; p &lt; .05) was observed between patients' overall satisfaction as indicated from the IOI-HA and the practice-specific quality assurance satisfaction question. T-tests on IOI-HA items 4 (satisfaction) and 7 (quality of life) revealed that the present participants' responses were significantly higher than for those in the normative study.CONCLUSIONS: Gender and hearing aid experience did not influence these patients' responses on the IOI-HA, and all respondents were satisfied with their hearing aids and the practice that dispensed them. No major differences were found between these patients' IOI-HA results and normative data suggesting that both sets of respondents were satisfied with their hearing aids. However, limited statistical comparisons for the satisfaction and quality of life items revealed significant differences in favor of these participants' scores over those in the normative study. This suggested that the advanced hearing aid technology used here had a positive effect on patients' ratings and that the IOI-HA norms should be updated periodically to reflect changes in technology."
"19363719","Survey on hearing aid use and satisfaction in Switzerland and their determinants.","The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficiency of the Swiss hearing aid dispensing system, and to determine factors contributing to successful hearing aid provision. A national cross sectional survey was performed using a postal questionnaire with 8707 adult hearing aid owners (response rate 62%). To correct results for a potential non-response bias, 193 randomly selected non-respondents were contacted by telephone. Data on hearing loss and type of hearing aid were provided by the hearing aid dispensing practice. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify determinants of non-regular use and dissatisfaction. Eighty-five percent used their device(s) regularly, 12% only occasionally and 3% never. Eighty percent were satisfied with their aids. Non-regular use of hearing aids was significantly associated with age, gender, regional language, total duration of use, type of amplification, hearing aid category, hearing loss, and dissatisfaction with and difficulties in managing the aid. Dissatisfaction was associated with regional language, total duration of use, difficulties in managing the aid, and non-regular use. It was concluded that rates of regular hearing aid use and satisfaction are high in Switzerland."
"21109549","Factors influencing help seeking, hearing aid uptake, hearing aid use and satisfaction with hearing aids: a review of the literature.","OBJECTIVES: This descriptive summary of the literature provides an overview of the available studies (published between January 1980 and January 2009) on correlates of help-seeking behavior for hearing loss, hearing-aid uptake, hearing-aid use, and satisfaction with the device.METHODS: Publications were identified by structured searches in Pubmed and Cinahl and by inspecting the reference lists of relevant articles. The articles covered different stages that a person with hearing impairment may go through: prior to hearing aid fitting, the period covering the fitting and the period post hearing aid fitting. Inclusion of articles occurred according to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were extracted by two independent researchers. Thirty-nine papers were included that identified 31 factors examined in relation to the four outcome measures. These covered personal factors (e.g., source of motivation, expectation, attitude), demographic factors (e.g., age, gender) and external factors (e.g., cost, counseling). Only two studies covered the actual fitting process. There was only one factor positively affecting all four outcome variables. This was self-reported hearing disability. The vast majority of studies showed no relationship of age and gender with any of the outcome domains.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Whereas research of the last 28 years yielded valuable information regarding relevant and irrelevant factors in hearing aid health care, there are still many relevant issues that have never been investigated in controlled studies. These are discussed."
"21034698","Hearing aid fitting outcome: clinical application and psychometric properties of a Swedish translation of the international outcome inventory for hearing aids (IOI-HA).","BACKGROUND: The International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA) is a seven-item hearing-specific questionnaire. It was developed with the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of hearing aid rehabilitation. Few psychometric properties have been presented for a Swedish translation of the IOI-HA. Furthermore, previous studies have examined the IOI-HA in mainly sensorineural hearing losses, and we do not know how the type of hearing loss affects the outcome.PURPOSE: To evaluate the hearing aid fitting outcome measured in a clinical setting using a Swedish translation of the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA), to determine the psychometric properties of the translation, and to examine how a number of demographic variables such as type of hearing loss affect the outcome.RESEARCH DESIGN: A descriptive and correlational study in a retrospective sample.STUDY SAMPLE: Two hundred and twenty-four (107 females and 117 males; ages 27-94 yr with an average of 66.1 yr) first-time hearing aid users.INTERVENTION: Mostly digital hearing aids (97.8%) were fitted monaurally (60%) or binaurally (40%) between 2007 and 2009.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The subjects were mailed the IOI-HA questionnaire six months after their final appointment, and the completed questionnaire was returned by mail to the clinic. The psychometric properties were evaluated and compared to previous studies using the IOI-HA. The associations between the outcome scores and a number of demographic variables (age, gender, degree of hearing loss, type of hearing loss, number of hearing aids, and type of hearing aids) were examined. Based on the pure tone audiograms, the subjects were divided into three groups; those with conductive hearing losses, sensorineural hearing losses, and mixed hearing losses. For these groups, the differences in outcome measured as IOI-HA were examined.RESULTS: The psychometric properties of the present translation of the IOI-HA showed resemblance in many aspects to previous reports. Furthermore, the type of hearing loss seems to affect the IOI-HA outcome. Hearing loss increases with increasing age, and hearing aid use increases with increasing degree of hearing loss. Subjects with sensorineural hearing losses show significantly poorer scores on items concerning introspective aspects of the outcome in comparison to subjects with mixed hearing losses and subjects with conductive hearing losses. Monaurally fitted subjects tend to report lower scores on average, but monaural or binaural hearing aid fitting do not significantly affect the subjective outcome.CONCLUSIONS: The psychometric properties of the present Swedish translation of the IOI-HA show resemblance in many aspects to previous reports, but the differences observed could be due to differences in the study populations. Overall, the demographic variables examined could not be used as predictors for the hearing aid fitting outcome, and more reliable predictors need to be identified."
"20380609","Survey on hearing aid outcome in Switzerland: associations with type of fitting (bilateral/unilateral), level of hearing aid signal processing, and hearing loss.","The present investigation further analysed results of a previously reported survey with a large sample of hearing aid owners (Bertoli et al, 2009) to determine the individual and technological factors related to hearing aid outcome. In particular the associations of hearing loss, level of signal processing, and fitting type (bilateral versus unilateral fitting) with hearing aid use, satisfaction with and management of the aid were evaluated. A sub-group with symmetrical hearing loss was analysed (n = 6027). Regular use was more frequent in bilateral users and in owners of devices with more complex signal processing, but the strongest determinant of regular use was severity of hearing loss. Satisfaction was higher in the group wearing simple devices, while fitting type and degree of hearing loss had no influence on satisfaction rates. Moderate and severe hearing loss was associated more frequently with poor management of the aid than mild hearing loss. It was concluded that bilateral amplification and advanced signal processing features may contribute to successful hearing aid fitting, but the resulting differences must be considered to be relatively small."
"22026556","Daily life consequences of hearing loss in the elderly.","PURPOSE: To assess the daily life consequences of hearing loss in older adults and to explore the influences of hearing loss, subjective assessment of health and general life satisfaction, gender, age and marital status.METHOD: Eighty-four participants, each older than 65 years, were consecutively recruited from a hospital waiting list for outpatient hearing aid fitting. All participants were assessed by pure-tone audiometry. Daily life consequences of hearing loss were measured using the Hearing Disability and Handicap Scale, which assesses perceived activity limitation and participation restriction. Another questionnaire was used to measure self-assessed health and life satisfaction.RESULTS: Adjusted linear regression analysis showed that activity limitation was significantly associated with increased hearing loss (p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.028) and decreased health (p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.009), and participation restriction with lower estimated life satisfaction (p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.001). Gender, age and marital status were not determinant factors for perceived activity limitation or participation restriction.CONCLUSIONS: Daily life consequences of hearing loss, health conditions and general life satisfaction are closely related. These findings indicate that health factors and psychosocial aspects should be emphasised as a natural part of audiological rehabilitation."
"21795978","Gender and hearing aids: patterns of use and determinants of nonregular use.","OBJECTIVE: Research addressing gender and hearing has focused mainly on differences in the auditory systems of men and women, communication, and psychological issues. Differences between men and women in the use of hearing aids are less clear. To date, no study has examined the effects of gender on hearing aid use as a primary aim. However, use patterns and underlying reasons for not using hearing aids may differ between men and women, or there might be a gender difference in the impact of some determinants on hearing aid use. A consideration of such factors could increase hearing aid use. Therefore, the aim of the present investigation was to provide information about gender-related influences on hearing aid use by examining differences in usage patterns and determinants of nonregular use.DESIGN: This study used cross-sectional survey data from 4979 adult male and 3410 adult female hearing aid owners in Switzerland in 2005. The survey data, including self-reported hearing aid use, were matched to the hearing loss data and the hearing aid technical information. Descriptive analyses were performed for the use patterns, age at first fitting, and audiogram slope. The determinants of nonregular use were examined using logistic regression models that were stratified by gender.RESULTS: Compared with men, women reported a higher prevalence of daily and regular use and a longer daily duration of use of hearing aids. Men more commonly indicated a limited benefit as a reason for nonregular use. The multivariate analyses showed that nonregular use was significantly less likely in women. The audiogram slope strongly contributed to this difference. Stratified analyses showed that for both men and women, poor handling and low satisfaction were associated with a higher likelihood for nonregular hearing aid use. Associations were discrepant for asymmetric hearing loss, which was a risk factor in women but a protective factor in men. Higher risks of nonregular use were found in men with steeper audiogram slopes and longer durations of ownership of their current aids, in women fitted with their first aid in the previous 2 to 5 yr, and in women older than 65 yr.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the present study provides evidence of gender-specific factors that influence hearing aid use patterns in men and women and of groups at higher risk for nonregular hearing aid use. Men with steeper audiogram slopes and the other subgroups of men and women with an increased risk for nonregular use should given particular attention when fitting their aids. As common risk factors for nonregular use, poor handling and low satisfaction should be addressed during the fitting process for all users. Further research is needed to clarify the differential influence of asymmetric hearing loss on hearing aid use in men and women. This information could improve hearing aid use and should be incorporated into daily clinical practice."

This instrument is divided into subscales: positive effects, service and costs, negative factors and personal image.RESULTS: It was shown that the subjects of this study were very happy with the use of hearing aid devices. There was significant difference in relating the daily use of the devices with the overall satisfaction score and subscale of personal image.CONCLUSION: It was found that the subjects of the study were very happy with the use of hearing aids, although satisfaction was not related to the variables: age, gender, time of use and device type. In general, participants with higher daily use are happier."
"22752928","Hearing aid satisfaction and use in the advanced digital era.","HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate satisfaction ratings and use patterns of advanced digital hearing aids (HAs) in a group of hearing-impaired adults by means of self-report questionnaires.STUDY DESIGN: A self report questionnaire study.METHODS: One hundred seventy-seven hearing-impaired adults who were fitted with advanced digital HAs at the Speech and Hearing Center at Sheba Medical Center were asked to participate in a structured telephone interview regarding HA satisfaction and use by means of the Satisfaction With Amplification in Daily Life (SADL) questionnaire. Patients who were not using their HAs completed a nonuse questionnaire.RESULTS: One hundred thirty-one patients participated in the survey, yielding a response rate of 74%. Eighty-three percent used their HAs regularly, whereas 17% were nonusers. Of the users, 92% were satisfied to some degree with their HAs. The global SADL score was 5.12 on a scale of 1 to 7. Background variables that were significantly associated with satisfaction ratings were hours of HA use per day, fitting mode (binaural vs. monaural), age, and degree of hearing loss. Although nonuse was not significantly associated with background variables, the main reasons for nonuse were excessive amplification in background noise and minimal functional benefit.CONCLUSIONS: High satisfaction and use rates were characteristic of adults fitted with advanced digital HAs. Patients should be advised that longer use of HAs per day may lead to higher satisfaction and that binaural amplification is advantageous, especially while communicating in noise. Finally, expectation from HA functionality in challenging listening situations should be realistic, as additional research and technology development is still needed."

"24141666","Auditory satisfaction of patients fitted with hearing aids in the Brazilian Public Health Service and benefits offered by the hearing aids.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the benefits and degree of satisfaction of adult and elderly patients fitted with hearing aids in a service accredited by the Brazilian Public Health Service.METHOD: This descriptive cross-sectional study included 34 individuals with bilateral hearing loss aged 18 and above who had never been offered hearing aids. Scales &quot;Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults&quot; and &quot;Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly Screening Version&quot; were used to assess the benefits yielded by the hearing aids. Scale &quot;Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life&quot; was used to gauge patient satisfaction. The first two were applied on the day the patients were fitted with hearing aids and one month later, whereas the third was applied only one month after the patients had been fitted with the hearing aids.RESULTS: After the subjects were offered hearing aids, significant reductions were seen in the difficulties they experienced as a consequence of hearing loss. The scores in the Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life scale indicated a high degree of satisfaction among patients. These results were not statistically different when gender and age (adult/elderly) subgroups were compared.CONCLUSION: The subjects included in the study have benefitted from being fitted with hearing aids and have been very happy with the outcome of the treatment."
"23744085","[User benefit of modern hearing aids. A comparative study].","BACKGROUND: In the face of the rapid development of hearing aid system technology it is helpful to regularly study the user benefit of the current generation.TEST PERSONS AND METHODS: To contribute to the question on how the user benefit of current hearing aids compares with the benefit of the previous generation of hearing aids, a multicentre study was carried out in cooperation with 79 hearing aid acoustics companies in Germany. The user benefit of modern hearing aids in everyday life was assessed by asking end users to participate in a survey by completing a questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 20 items, 10 of which were taken from validated international inventories (SSQ: Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing scale, IOI-HA: International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids) and the other 10 were formulated particularly for this purpose.RESULTS: A total of 664 usable questionnaires were returned whereby 421 responders were first time users and 243 responders were previous hearing aid users. The results of the present study showed that modern hearing aid system technology provides significant extra benefits at the 5 % level relative to the previous generation of hearing aids for all variables tested in this study.CONCLUSIONS: Even though the amount of gain in terms of user benefit may be overestimated due to well-known placebo effects, an obvious net effect was evident. Correlations between the level of hearing aid benefit and possible influencing factors, such as age, gender, subjects own hearing aid, duration of use or hearing loss, could not be identified."
"25991994","Degree of satisfaction among hearing aid users.","INTRODUCTION: Hearing loss (HL) is defined as the complete or partial loss of hearing ability.AIMS: To characterize (1) the degree of satisfaction among adult and elderly hearing aid (HA) users who were treated by a public hearing health service and (2) the relationship between satisfaction and the variables of gender, age, degree of HL, and type of HA.METHOD: The clinical and experimental study included the administration of the Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life (SADL) questionnaire to 110 patients who had used HAs for more than 3 months and were 18 years of age or older.RESULTS: Test patients were sex-balanced (48% were women) and had a mean age of 67 years. A relatively high incidence of sensorineural moderate HL was detected in the study patients (66%) and device B was the most commonly used HA type (48%). No significant differences were evident between HA satisfaction and sex. The importance placed on services/costs and personal image varied between age groups. Correlation was evident at all levels between user satisfaction and amplification. Decreased satisfaction was observed in individuals with severe and/or profound HL. The type of HA used yielded statistically significant differences in the positive effects referring.CONCLUSION: No correlations were evident between the different factors proposed. HA users exhibited high levels of satisfaction in all SADL areas."
"24828216","Prediction of IOI-HA scores using speech reception thresholds and speech discrimination scores in quiet.","BACKGROUND: Outcome measures can be used to improve the quality of the rehabilitation by identifying and understanding which variables influence the outcome. This information can be used to improve outcomes for clients. In clinical practice, pure-tone audiometry, speech reception thresholds (SRTs), and speech discrimination scores (SDSs) in quiet or in noise are common assessments made prior to hearing aid (HA) fittings. It is not known whether SRT and SDS in quiet relate to HA outcome measured with the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA).PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between pure-tone average (PTA), SRT, and SDS in quiet and IOI-HA in both first-time and experienced HA users.RESEARCH DESIGN: SRT and SDS were measured in a sample of HA users who also responded to the IOI-HA.STUDY SAMPLE: Fifty-eight Danish-speaking adult HA users.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The psychometric properties were evaluated and compared to previous studies using the IOI-HA. The associations and differences between the outcome scores and a number of descriptive variables (age, gender, fitted monaurally/binaurally with HA, first-time/experienced HA users, years of HA use, time since last HA fitting, best ear PTA, best ear SRT, or best ear SDS) were examined. A multiple forward stepwise regression analysis was conducted using scores on the separate IOI-HA items, the global score, and scores on the introspection and interaction subscales as dependent variables to examine whether the descriptive variables could predict these outcome measures.RESULTS: Scores on single IOI-HA items, the global score, and scores on the introspection (items 1, 2, 4, and 7) and interaction (items 3, 5, and 6) subscales closely resemble those previously reported. Multiple regression analysis showed that the best ear SDS predicts about 18-19% of the outcome on items 3 and 5 separately, and about 16% on the interaction subscale (sum of items 3, 5, and 6) CONCLUSIONS: The best ears SDS explains some of the variance displayed in the IOI-HA global score and the interaction subscale. The relation between SDS and IOI-HA suggests that a poor unaided SDS might in itself be a limiting factor for the HA rehabilitation efficacy and hence the IOI-HA outcome. The clinician could use this information to align the user's HA expectations to what is within possible reach."

A total of 555 (78%) patients replied and 426 patients (77%) submitted their answers to the questionnaires.RESULTS: Female patients had significantly higher Tinnitus Handicap Inventory scores than male patients. An open question about the experienced quality of the care that the patients obtained at our ENT clinics resulted in 159 comments (37%). The majority of the comments were about the hearing aids and many patients did not identify their hearing aids as a treatment. Patients who did not feel that the treatment they obtained at our ENT clinics was good had a significantly higher pure tone average (PTA).CONCLUSION: The results showed that many patients who did not feel that the treatment they obtained at our ENT clinics was good had no hearing aids (61%) and this level of dissatisfaction was significantly higher than in patients who stated that they had received treatment (45%). The use of hearing aids as the main treatment model in patients suffering from tinnitus and hearing impairment can be recommended in these patients. Further research is required to find an approach that could motivate patients with both tinnitus and hearing impairment to use hearing aids."

"27094053","Satisfaction and compliance of adult patients using hearing aid and evaluation of factors affecting them.","The aims of this study are to reveal patient compliance and satisfaction in hearing aid-prescribed adult population and to determine the relevant clinical factors. The study was designed retrospectively, and those patients who have been using hearing aid for at least 6 months were invited for evaluation. Demographical data, hearing aid type (digital vs analog), general satisfaction, and daily usage time were asked. Then, the Hearing Aid Satisfaction Questionnaire (HASQ) was applied to all patients which included visual analog scale (VAS)-based 10 questions about the effects of hearing aid on social communication, efficiency, cosmetics, life quality and cost. Totally 400 patients were included in the study. The HASQ was confirmed to be highly reliable by &quot;Kaiser Meyer Olkin and Bartlett Sphericity&quot; tests after exclusion of aid-cost question. There was a negative correlation between age and satisfaction, and a positive correlation between hearing aid usage time (years) and satisfaction (p &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference between mean HASQ scores regarding gender, employment status, hearing aid type and the site of hearing aid wearing. HASQ scores were significantly worse in pure sensorineural loss type, lower educational status, shorter daily usage time, but better in higher pure tone threshold levels (p &lt; 0.05). Age, time of hearing aid usage daily, type of hearing impairment, the threshold of hearing and education were the factors affecting satisfaction. Regular daily usage of hearing aid should be encouraged in patients, since by this way aid usage and satisfaction may be improved."

"28590898","Tinnitus Management: Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Extended-Wear Hearing Aids, Conventional Hearing Aids, and Combination Instruments.","BACKGROUND: Whereas hearing aids have long been considered effective for providing relief from tinnitus, controlled clinical studies evaluating this premise have been very limited.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to systematically determine the relative efficacy of conventional receiver-in-the-canal hearing aids (HA), the same hearing aids with a sound generator (HA+SG), and extended-wear, deep fit hearing aids (EWHA), to provide relief from tinnitus through a randomized controlled trial. Each of these ear-level devices was a product of Phonak, LLC.RESEARCH DESIGN: Participants were randomized to HA, HA+SG, or EWHA and wore bilaterally fit devices for about 4 months. Fittings, adjustments, and follow-up appointments were conducted to comply with company guidelines and to ensure that all participants attended appointments on the same schedule. At 4-5 months, participants returned to complete final outcome measures, which concluded their study participation.STUDY SAMPLE: Participants were 55 individuals (mean age: 63.1 years) with mild to moderately-severe hearing loss who: (a) did not currently use hearing aids; (b) reported tinnitus that was sufficiently bothersome to warrant intervention; and (c) were suitable candidates for each of the study devices.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The primary outcome measure was the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI). Secondary outcome measures included hearing-specific questionnaires and the Quick Speech in Noise test (QuickSIN). The goal of the analysis was to evaluate efficacy of the EWHA and HA+SG devices versus the HA standard device.RESULTS: There were 18 participants in each of the HA and EWHA groups and 19 in the HA+SG group. Gender, age, and baseline TFI severity were balanced across treatment groups. Nearly all participants had a reduction in tinnitus symptoms during the study. The average TFI change (improvement) from baseline was 21 points in the HA group, 31 points in the EWHA group, and 33 points in the HA+SG group. A &quot;clinically significant&quot; improvement in reaction to tinnitus (at least 13-point reduction in TFI score) was seen by 67% of HA, 82% of EWHA, and 79% of HA+SG participants. There were no statistically significant differences in the extent to which the devices reduced TFI scores. Likewise, the hearing-specific questionnaires and QuickSIN showed improvements following use of the hearing aids but these improvements did not differ across device groups.CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to conclude that any of these devices offers greater relief from tinnitus than any other one tested. However, all devices appear to offer some improvement in the functional effects of tinnitus."
