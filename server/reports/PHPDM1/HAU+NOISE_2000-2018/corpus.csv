"15592858","Detecting components of hearing aid fitting using a self-assessment-inventory.","The evaluation of hearing-aid fitting includes numerous assessments such as electro- and psychoacoustic tests. The subjective estimation of the hearing aid user can be elicited with self-assessment inventories encompassing various parameters, e.g., benefit, satisfaction and usage. A questionnaire comprising 11 domains (disability, handicap, frequency and significance of the listening situation, importance of the hearing aid, expectation, demand, aided performance, benefit, satisfaction and usage) within three different conditions (speech in quiet and in noise and listening to sounds) was used to detect components underlying hearing aid fitting. The data show a three-factor structure (situation-, restriction- and aid-related variables) independent from the conditions. Usage depends on all of the three factors. Disability and handicap reveal the highest values for speech in noise, whereas the aid-related factor shows the lowest values for this condition. Global satisfaction with the hearing aid is significantly correlated with the aid-related factor, but independent from the restriction of hearing. The aid-related factor is positively influenced by the amount of social activity because more active persons report higher benefit and satisfaction for all listening conditions. Age does not exhibit a significant relationship to one of the components. Basically, all correlation coefficients are only intermediate, revealing that inter-individual differences of the patients are rather high. The data indicate that extra-audiological factors might also play an important role in the success of hearing aid fitting."
"15912340","[The first hearing aid increases mental capacity. Open controlled clinical trial as a pilot study].","BACKGROUND: According to the scientific literature, a hearing impairment which is acquired late reduces mental efficiency.OBJECTIVE: To determine by empirical examination whether hearing aids increase mental efficiency. PERSONS AND METHODS: An open controlled application study was carried out on the capacity of working memory in 15 first users of hearing aids.RESULTS: The working memory's capacity in the 15 users (age: 72+/-12 years; six females; crystallized IQ: 100+/-13; test-retest period: 74+/-35 days) increased 13+/-19% (IQ-increment 3.4+/-6.3 points), while the capacity of the 15 controls (age: 71+/-11 years; seven females; crystallized IQ: 103+/-12; test-retest period: 58+/-21 days) remained unchanged: 0+/-12% (IQ-change: -0.3+/-5.1 points). The difference between the samples is significant (p=0.012 one-tailed). The visually and auditively administered subtests yielded equal changes. According to self-reports, the daily wearing time was 6.7+/-3.5 h. Daily wearing times of the hearing aids (self-reports) of between 4-8 h showed the multiple IQ-gain compared to lesser or longer times. The audiometric gain in hearing without noise on the right (rho=0.58; significant), left (0.48; not significant), and on both sides (0.68; significant) correlated with IQ-gain.CONCLUSIONS: Under a more favourable usage a still more striking benefit is to be expected in mental efficiency."
"17580723","NIDCD/VA hearing aid clinical trial and follow-up: background.","This report provides background regarding the Long Term Follow-Up of Patients in the NIDCD/VA Hearing Aid Clinical Trial study and serves as an introduction to the detailed reports that follow in this issue of Journal of the American Academy of Audiology. The authors investigated five- to seven-year benefit/satisfaction in participants from the original NIDCDNA Hearing Aid Clinical Trial. The new study was designed to investigate current use of the original study hearing aids, to compare changes in selected audiological measures, and to assess possible predictors of long-term hearing aid use. The outcome measures included estimates of speech intelligibility in quiet and noise, self-reported patterns of hearing aid usage, self-reported estimates of activity limitations and quality-of-life issues, estimates of hearing aid satisfaction, and self-reported hearing aid benefit. Overall, the short-term benefits of hearing aid use observed during the original trial were noted to persist in the long term."
"18840704","Long-term usage of modern signal processing by listeners with severe or profound hearing loss: a retrospective survey.","PURPOSE: To investigate the long-term benefit of multichannel wide dynamic range compression (WDRC) alone and in combination with directional microphones and noise reduction/speech enhancement for listeners with severe or profound hearing loss.METHOD: At the conclusion of a research project, 39 participants with severe or profound hearing loss were fitted with WDRC in one program and WDRC with directional microphones and speech enhancement enabled in a 2nd program. More than 2 years after the 1st participants exited the project, a retrospective survey was conducted to determine the participants' use of, and satisfaction with, the 2 programs.RESULTS: From the 30 returned questionnaires, it seems that WDRC is used with a high degree of satisfaction in general everyday listening situations. The reported benefit from the addition of a directional microphone and speech enhancement for listening in noisy environments was lower and varied among the users. This variable was significantly correlated with how much the program was used.CONCLUSIONS: The less frequent and more varied use of the program with directional microphones and speech enhancement activated in combination suggests that these features may be best offered in a 2nd listening program for listeners with severe or profound hearing loss."
"20619332","Acoustic stimulation treatments against tinnitus could be most effective when tinnitus pitch is within the stimulated frequency range.","Acoustic stimulation with hearing aids or noise devices is frequently used in tinnitus therapy. However, such behind-the-ear devices are limited in their high-frequency output with an upper cut-off frequency of approximately 5-6 kHz. Theoretical modeling suggests that acoustic stimulation treatments with these devices might be most effective when the tinnitus pitch is within the stimulated frequency range. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a pilot study with 15 subjects with chronic tinnitus. Eleven subjects received hearing aids and four subjects noise devices. Perceived tinnitus loudness was measured using a visual analog scale, and tinnitus-related distress was assessed using the Tinnitus Questionnaire. After six months of device usage, reductions of perceived tinnitus loudness were seen only in subjects with a tinnitus pitch of less than 6 kHz. When subjects were grouped by tinnitus pitch, the group of patients with a tinnitus pitch of less than 6 kHz (n = 10 subjects) showed a significant reduction in perceived tinnitus loudness (from 73.4 +/- 6.1 before to 56.4 +/- 7.4 after treatment, p = 0.012), whereas in subjects with a tinnitus pitch of 6 kHz or more (n = 5 subjects) tinnitus loudness was slightly increased after six months of treatment (65.0 +/- 4.7 before and 70.6 +/- 5.9 after treatment), but the increase was not significant (p = 0.063). Likewise, tinnitus-related distress was significantly decreased in the low-pitch group (from 31.6 +/- 4.3 to 20.9 +/- 4.8, p = 0.0059), but not in the group with high-pitched tinnitus (30.2 +/- 3.3 before and 30.0 +/- 5.1 after treatment, p = 1). Overall, reductions in tinnitus-related distress in our study were less pronounced than those reported for more comprehensive treatments. However, the differences we observed between the low- and the high-pitch group show that tinnitus pitch might influence the outcome of acoustic stimulation treatments when devices with a limited frequency range are used."
"20131363","Bone-anchored hearing aid subjective benefit for unilateral deafness.","HYPOTHESIS: Determine the benefit of the bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) in patients with unilateral deafness.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series and prospective questionnaire study at a tertiary referral center.METHODS: Patients with unilateral deafness of various etiologies who were implanted with a BAHA (n = 126) or not implanted with a BAHA after a translabyrinthine craniotomy (n = 126) were mailed questionnaires. A total of 139 patients (55%) responded to the questionnaires. Patients who were implanted with a BAHA received a general questionnaire concerning BAHA usage, the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB), and the Speech, Spatial, and Qualities of Hearing Questionnaire (SSQ). Patients not implanted with a BAHA received only the SSQ hearing questionnaire.RESULTS: Patients with unilateral deafness demonstrated a benefit with BAHA use on the APHAB. Most improvement with the BAHA was seen in the Background Noise subscale, with a 17.4% improvement. Ease of Communication and Reverberation subscales also demonstrated an 11.6% and 13.2% benefit, respectively. Patients with a BAHA demonstrated better scores in the SSQ Speech subscale when compared to unilaterally deaf patients who did not have a BAHA, although this difference was not significant.CONCLUSIONS: The APHAB demonstrated significant benefit with the use of a BAHA in patients with unilateral deafness. Although the SSQ speech subscale showed overall improvement in auditory disability with the use of a BAHA, this difference was not significant. However, the SSQ hearing questionnaire demonstrated specific situations were the BAHA is most useful."
"20046416","Hearing threshold of Korean adolescents associated with the use of personal music players.","PURPOSE: Hearing loss can lead to a number of disabilities and can reduce quality of life. Noise-induced hearing losses have become more common among adolescents due to increased exposure to personal music players. We, therefore, investigated the use of personal music player among Korean adolescents and the relationship between hearing threshold and usage pattern of portable music players.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 490 adolescents were interviewed personally regarding their use of portable music players, including the time and type of player and the type of headphone used. Pure tone audiometry was performed in each subject.RESULTS: Of the 490 subjects, 462 (94.3%) used personal music players and most of them have used the personal music player for 1-3 hours per day during 1-3 years. The most common type of portable music player was the MP3 player, and the most common type of headphone was the earphone (insert type). Significant elevations of hearing threshold were observed in males, in adolescents who had used portable music players for over 5 years, for those over 15 years in cumulative period and in those who had used earphones.CONCLUSION: Portable music players can have a deleterious effect on hearing threshold in adolescents. To preserve hearing, adolescents should avoid using portable music players for long periods of time and should avoid using earphones."
"22104328","Improvement in word recognition score with level is associated with hearing aid ownership among patients with hearing loss.","Market surveys consistently show that only 22% of those with hearing loss own hearing aids. This is often ascribed to cosmetics, but is it possible that patients apply a different auditory criterion than do audiologists and manufacturers? We tabulated hearing aid ownership in a survey of 1000 consecutive patients. We separated hearing loss cases, with one cohort in which word recognition in quiet could improve with gain (vs. 40 dB HL) and another without such improvement but nonetheless with audiometric thresholds within the manufacturer's fitting ranges. Overall, we found that exactly 22% of hearing loss patients in this sample owned hearing aids; the same finding has been reported in many previous, well-accepted surveys. However, while all patients in the two cohorts experienced difficulty in noise, patients in the cohort without word recognition improvement were found to own hearing aids at a rate of 0.3%, while those patients whose word recognition could increase with level were found to own hearing aids at a rate of 50%. Results also coherently fit a logistic model where shift of the word recognition performance curve by level corresponded to the likelihood of ownership. In addition to the common attribution of low hearing aid usage to patient denial, cosmetic issues, price, or social stigma, these results provide one alternative explanation based on measurable improvement in word recognition performance."
"21864473","Hearing aids in the real world: use of multimemory and volume controls.","BACKGROUND: Despite advances in technology, hearing aid users continue to express a desire for some control over their devices. Access to a suitable control can significantly affect overall satisfaction with amplification, yet little is known about the circumstances that drive hearing aid users to manipulate controls. Such information would be useful in guiding clinical decisions about the selection of controls and synchronization of their operation in a bilateral pair of hearing aids.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the real-world use of multimemory (MM) and volume (VC) controls and environmental characteristics that may influence their use.RESEARCH DESIGN: Real-time data about MM and VC usage were gathered in the real world. Subjective reports of the environmental characteristics were obtained. This design allowed examination of the nature of hearing aid adjustments as well as exploration of factors affecting them.STUDY SAMPLE: Ten adults with bilaterally symmetric, mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss participated in the study. All had previous experience with hearing aids.INTERVENTION: Participants were fitted bilaterally with BTE (behind-the-ear) hearing aids equipped with an MM button and/or VC wheel. The devices were connected to a PDA (personal digital assistant) that logged data from the hearing aids and stored surveys completed by participants in various listening situations.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The following data were obtained from the PDA: (1) MM and VC settings in the left and right devices, (2) broadband input level at the microphone of the left and right devices, and (3) participant reports of the presence, distance, and location of signal and background noise. Prevalence of nondefault settings and bilateral symmetry of hearing aid adjustments were summarized descriptively, while the influence of environmental characteristics on hearing aid adjustments was analyzed using nonparametric methods.RESULTS: Over 4-5 wk, 912 hr of data were logged and 184 surveys completed. Results showed that (1) the default (i.e., the programmed or &quot;use&quot;) setting was preferred most often, (2) the preferred hearing aid settings were mostly bilaterally symmetrical, and (3) nondefault settings were often used in difficult listening situations.CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study generally support the use of synchronized MMs and/or VCs, although there may be exceptions to their utility."
"21595614","[Hearing aid use and patient satisfaction].","OBJECTIVES: In this study, we assessed the hearing aid usage ratios and durations, patient satisfaction and the probable causes of disuse if they are not used.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A questionnaire with 16 questions was applied to the patients who were prescribed hearing aids in our clinic between January 2007 and December 2009. A total of 517 patients were called by phone. Hundred and seventy-nine of the patients (75 females, 104 males; mean age 60±23 years; range 17 to 94 years) participated in the trial. Hearing aid usage ratios and patients' satisfaction were determined and the factors influencing usage were statistically investigated.RESULTS: Hundred and forty-two of the patients used their hearing aids regularly and 37 of the patients either used their aids rarely or never used them. The most common cause reported for disuse was the frequent noise coming from the hearing aid.CONCLUSION: Failure to explain the usage of the hearing aids to the patients and age over 70 years have a statistically significant negative effect on the duration of hearing aid use and patient satisfaction."
"21399676","Broadened population-level frequency tuning in human auditory cortex of portable music player users.","Nowadays, many people use portable players to enrich their daily life with enjoyable music. However, in noisy environments, the player volume is often set to extremely high levels in order to drown out the intense ambient noise and satisfy the appetite for music. Extensive and inappropriate usage of portable music players might cause subtle damages in the auditory system, which are not behaviorally detectable in an early stage of the hearing impairment progress. Here, by means of magnetoencephalography, we objectively examined detrimental effects of portable music player misusage on the population-level frequency tuning in the human auditory cortex. We compared two groups of young people: one group had listened to music with portable music players intensively for a long period of time, while the other group had not. Both groups performed equally and normally in standard audiological examinations (pure tone audiogram, speech test, and hearing-in-noise test). However, the objective magnetoencephalographic data demonstrated that the population-level frequency tuning in the auditory cortex of the portable music player users was significantly broadened compared to the non-users, when attention was distracted from the auditory modality; this group difference vanished when attention was directed to the auditory modality. Our conclusion is that extensive and inadequate usage of portable music players could cause subtle damages, which standard behavioral audiometric measures fail to detect in an early stage. However, these damages could lead to future irreversible hearing disorders, which would have a huge negative impact on the quality of life of those affected, and the society as a whole."
"22642311","Evaluation of model-based versus non-parametric monaural noise-reduction approaches for hearing aids.","OBJECTIVE: Single channel noise reduction has been well investigated and seems to have reached its limits in terms of speech intelligibility improvement, however, the quality of such schemes can still be advanced. This study tests to what extent novel model-based processing schemes might improve performance in particular for non-stationary noise conditions.DESIGN: Two prototype model-based algorithms, a speech-model-based, and a auditory-model-based algorithm were compared to a state-of-the-art non-parametric minimum statistics algorithm. A speech intelligibility test, preference rating, and listening effort scaling were performed. Additionally, three objective quality measures for the signal, background, and overall distortions were applied. For a better comparison of all algorithms, particular attention was given to the usage of the similar Wiener-based gain rule.STUDY SAMPLE: The perceptual investigation was performed with fourteen hearing-impaired subjects.RESULTS: The results revealed that the non-parametric algorithm and the auditory model-based algorithm did not affect speech intelligibility, whereas the speech-model-based algorithm slightly decreased intelligibility. In terms of subjective quality, both model-based algorithms perform better than the unprocessed condition and the reference in particular for highly non-stationary noise environments.CONCLUSION: Data support the hypothesis that model-based algorithms are promising for improving performance in non-stationary noise conditions."
"22568994","Hearing disability measured by the speech, spatial, and qualities of hearing scale in clinically normal-hearing and hearing-impaired middle-aged persons, and disability screening by means of a reduced SSQ (the SSQ5).","OBJECTIVES: : The goals of the present study were twofold: in the first part, the prevalence and profile of hearing disability in healthy, middle-aged persons were determined by the speech, spatial, and qualities of hearing scale (SSQ). In the second part of this study, the number of SSQ items was reduced to five to make this questionnaire available for routine usage in clinical settings and for screening purposes.METHODS: : SSQ responses derived from 103 normal-hearing 18- to 25-year-old persons were compared with the SSQ responses of 24 clinically normal-hearing (all thresholds between 125 and 8000 Hz =25 dB HL) and 109 healthy, 55- to 65-year-old persons with age-related hearing impairment to determine the prevalence and profile of hearing disability. The 45 items of the SSQ were reduced to five by cluster analyses and binary logistic regression analyses. The robustness of this five-item version (SSQ5) was determined in three control populations: an adult 25- to 55-year-old population (n = 159), an ENT-patient population (n = 60), and a population of hearing aid candidates (n = 50). The feasibility of the SSQ5 for screening was compared with the feasibility of the simple question &quot;Do you have hearing loss?&quot; by determining, respectively, the sensitivity, specificity, and maximum achievable discriminatory power for predicting hearing status according to speech-in-noise performance.RESULTS: : Prevalence numbers showed data of healthy, middle-aged persons with significant disability, despite minimal impairment (25%) versus data of middle-aged persons with significant impairment and nevertheless, minimal disability (61%). The profile of hearing disability seemed similar in all normal-hearing and hearing-impaired subgroups (i.e., most problems with understanding speech especially in noise conditions, and least problems with sound quality). Compared with the single question: &quot;Do you have hearing loss?&quot; the use of the SSQ5 had 37% more maximum discriminatory power for determining hearing status category based on speech-in-noise performance in 55- to 65-year-old persons. In addition, the SSQ5 seemed robust in adult populations of different ages (89.6% correlation between the answers of the SSQ5 and SSQ45), as well as in ENT-patient populations (93.7% correlation) and hearing aid candidate populations (79.2% correlation).CONCLUSIONS: : The results of this study suggest that disability measures and measures for hearing impairment cannot replace each other, but are complementary. Therefore, it is advised to implement both disability measures and impairment measures in screening and referral policies for hearing loss. To get a first impression of hearing disability, our results suggest that it is useful to ask five disability questions (SSQ5) instead of one general question like &quot;Do you have hearing loss?&quot;"
"22397803","Threshold measurements by self-fitting hearing aids: feasibility and challenges.","A self-fitting, self-contained hearing aid is a device that can be managed entirely by the user, without assistance from a hearing health care professional or the need for special equipment. A key component of such a device is an automated audiometer that will enable the user to self-administer measurements of in situ thresholds, which the hearing aid will use to prescribe a baseline setting for the wearer. The success of the device therefore depends on the validity and reliability of in situ threshold measurements and automatically measured thresholds. To produce a complete and self-contained device, the self-fitting hearing aid will also enable identification of audiograms that are contraindicative of hearing aid usage. The feasibility and challenges of achieving these characteristics are explored and discussed. While the overall concept seems feasible, several challenges were identified that need thorough investigation and/or development. These include the use of instructions to self-manage hearing aid insertion and in situ threshold measurements, selection of an appropriate transducer and instant-fit tip that will allow measurements of a wide range of threshold levels, control of ambient noise during threshold measurements, and self-manageable procedures that enable identification of such audiogram characteristics as asymmetry and conductive hearing loss."
"24917904","Advantages of binaural amplification to acceptable noise level of directional hearing aid users.","OBJECTIVES: The goal of the present study was to examine whether Acceptable Noise Levels (ANLs) would be lower (greater acceptance of noise) in binaural listening than in monaural listening condition and also whether meaningfulness of background speech noise would affect ANLs for directional microphone hearing aid users. In addition, any relationships between the individual binaural benefits on ANLs and the individuals' demographic information were investigated.METHODS: Fourteen hearing aid users (mean age, 64 years) participated for experimental testing. For the ANL calculation, listeners' most comfortable listening levels and background noise level were measured. Using Korean ANL material, ANLs of all participants were evaluated under monaural and binaural amplification with a counterbalanced order. The ANLs were also compared across five types of competing speech noises, consisting of 1- through 8-talker background speech maskers. Seven young normal-hearing listeners (mean age, 27 years) participated for the same measurements as a pilot testing.RESULTS: The results demonstrated that directional hearing aid users accepted more noise (lower ANLs) with binaural amplification than with monaural amplification, regardless of the type of competing speech. When the background speech noise became more meaningful, hearing-impaired listeners accepted less amount of noise (higher ANLs), revealing that ANL is dependent on the intelligibility of the competing speech. The individuals' binaural advantages in ANLs were significantly greater for the listeners with longer experience of hearing aids, yet not related to their age or hearing thresholds.CONCLUSION: Binaural directional microphone processing allowed hearing aid users to accept a greater amount of background noise, which may in turn improve listeners' hearing aid success. Informational masking substantially influenced background noise acceptance. Given a significant association between ANLs and duration of hearing aid usage, ANL measurement can be useful for clinical counseling of binaural hearing aid candidates or unsuccessful users."
"26449672","[Hearing aid fitting: Effect of doubling the standard rate on compliance, quality of results, and excess payments].","BACKGROUND: This study investigates the effect that doubling the standard rate for hearing aid fitting which is covered by statutory insurance has had on the size of excess payments and compliance, as well as on benefits for patients and their satisfaction.METHODS: In April 2014, 859 members of a statutory insurance scheme (hkk) who received hearing aids in the 6 months prior to the reform were questioned on the timing and financial details of their hearing aid fitting, as well as on treatment compliance and quality of the results using a standardized questionnaire. In October 2014, the same questionnaire was used to collect these data from a further 622 insurance holders who had received hearing aids in the 8 months following introduction of the new regulation. Most of the questions concerning hearing quality corresponded to those of the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) questionnaire.RESULTS: The project revealed a statistically significant decrease of 6 percent points in the proportion of hearing aid users who had to pay any excess whatsoever; from 80.6% to 74.1%. However, 40% of the insured persons continued to pay an excess of 1000 euros and more. The subjective hearing quality remained practically unimproved by the reform and was statistically, almost without exception, independent of whether hearing aid users wore expensive devices associated with a large excess, or devices available at the standard rate. Finally, the study confirmed a previously recognized usage pattern characterized by noncompliance. For example, approximately 40% of hearing aid users did not wear their device in the everyday environment. This observation was independent of the size of the excess and the timing of the most recent visit to the hearing aid acoustician.CONCLUSION: Despite doubling of the standard rate, three quarters of patients pay an excess--sometimes a substantial one. The subjective hearing quality was not improved by doubling the standard rate; the majority of patients continue to complain of considerable problems with hearing in difficult situations (environments with background or reverberant noise). Satisfaction with hearing quality is neither dependent on the doubling of the standard rate, nor on whether or not an excess was paid. Compliance may possibly be improved by structured follow-up, which should involve the prescribing otorhinolaryngologists, as well as phoniatrists, pedaudiologists, and hearing aid acousticians."
"25905073","Prevalence and factors associated with hearing loss and hearing aid use in korean elders.","BACKGROUND: This study examined hearing loss prevalence and hearing aid usage rates among Korean elders by comparing the differences between those with and without hearing loss, and between those who used and did not use hearing aids.METHODS: This study was based on data collected during the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey V (2010-2012). The study sample consisted of 5,447 Koreans aged =60 years who received a hearing assessment. Hearing loss was measured using a pure tone audiometry test and classified according to the World Health Organization's criteria. Hearing aid use was assessed by self-report. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the associations between hearing loss, hearing aid use, and related variables.RESULTS: Hearing loss was found in 16.8% of the elders and only 15.9% of them used a hearing aid. Male (95% CI: 1.27-2.15), tinnitus (95% CI: 1.58-2.32), dizziness (95% CI: 1.05-1.73), and occupational noise exposure (95% CI: 1.32-2.38) were the variables most strongly associated with hearing loss after multivariate adjustment. Tinnitus (95% CI: 1.34-4.13) and occupational noise exposure (95% CI: 1.01-5.02) were strongly associated with hearing aid use after multivariate adjustment.CONCLUSION: More than half of South Korean elders aged =60 and older have hearing loss but the rate of hearing aid use is very low. An aural public health program should address modifiable risk factors, such as tinnitus and noise exposure, and non-modifiable risk factors associated with hearing loss in the elderly."
"25640403","Determinants of hearing-aid adoption and use among the elderly: a systematic review.","OBJECTIVE: While the benefits of hearing aids among older adults with presbycusis have been well documented, there is limited research on hearing-aid usage. The aim of this review is to synthesize current evidence to identify the determinants of hearing-aid adoption and use among the elderly.DESIGN: Systematic review.STUDY SAMPLE: Articles were identified through systematic searches in the Web of Science, Medline, CINAHL, and a manual search. Studies that explore the potential determinants of hearing-aid usage were to be included.RESULTS: A total of twenty-two articles were reviewed. Four audiological determinants (the severity of hearing loss, the type of hearing aids, background noise acceptance, and insertion gain) and seven non-audiological determinants (self-perceived hearing problems, expectation, demographics, group consultation, support from significant others, self-perceived benefit, and satisfaction) were identified as affecting the adoption and use of hearing aids.CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to explore the influence of significant others, health professionals, and user demographics on hearing rehabilitation for future research. The determinants identified in this review depicted the stage progression of the trans-theoretical model (TTM) in explaining an individual's readiness to hearing-aid usage."
"25634777","Hearing aid and hearing assistance technology use in Aotearoa/New Zealand.","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe factors that are related to hearing aid and hearing assistance technology ownership and use in Aotearoa/New Zealand.DESIGN: Adults with hearing impairment living in New Zealand were surveyed regarding health-related quality of life and device usage. Audiometric data (hearing sensitivity and speech in noise) were collected.STUDY SAMPLE: Data were obtained from 123 adults with hearing impairment: 73 reported current hearing-aid use, 81 reported current hearing assistance technology use.RESULTS: In both analyses, device users had more difficulty understanding speech in background noise, had poor hearing in both their better and worse hearing ears, and perceived more consequences of hearing impairment in their everyday lives (both emotionally and socially) than non-hearing-aid users. Discriminant analyses showed that the social consequences of hearing impairment and the better ear hearing best classified hearing aid users from non-users but social consequences and worse ear hearing best classified hearing assistance technology users from non-users.CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life measurements and speech-in-noise assessments provide useful clinical information. Hearing-impaired adults in New Zealand who use hearing aids also tend to use hearing assistance technology, which has important clinical implications."
"27951738","Functionality of hearing aids: state-of-the-art and future model-based solutions.","A review about technical and perceptual factors in hearing aid technology, research and development is provided, covering current commercial solutions, underlying models of hearing loss for usage in hearing devices and emerging future technical solutions for hearing aid functionalities. A chain of techniques has provided incremental, but steady increases in user benefit, e.g. in the fields of hearing aid amplification, feedback suppression, dynamic compression, noise reduction and situation adaptation. The models describing the perceptual consequences of sensorineural hearing impairment describe the effects on the acoustical level, the neurosensory level and the cognitive level and provide the framework for compensatory (or even substitutional) functions of hearing aids in terms of the attenuation component, the distortion component and the neural component of the hearing loss. A major factor is the requirement of a strong individualisation of hearing aid solutions calling for an appropriate assessment of the different sensorineural components of a hearing loss, especially with respect to bilateral and binaural hearing aid solutions."

PTS was determined by the MPL model for 234 audiograms and the SPL output recommended by four different validated prescription recommendations for hearing aids.PTS can, on rare occasion, occur as a result of SPL delivered by hearing aids at modern day prescription recommendations. The trading relationship of safe output SPL, decibel hearing level (dB HL) threshold, and PTS was captured with algebraic expressions. Better hearing thresholds lowered the safe output SPL and higher thresholds raised the safe output SPL.</AbstractText>: PTS can, on rare occasion, occur as a result of SPL delivered by hearing aids at modern day prescription recommendations.

"28534117","A multicenter study on objective and subjective benefits with a transcutaneous bone-anchored hearing aid device: first Nordic results.","Examination of objective as well as subjective outcomes with a new transcutaneous bone-anchored hearing aid device. The study was designed as a prospective multicenter consecutive case-series study involving tertiary referral centers at two Danish University Hospitals. A total of 23 patients were implanted. Three were lost to follow-up. Patients had single-sided deafness, conductive or mixed hearing loss.INTERVENTION: Rehabilitative. Aided and unaided sound field hearing was evaluated objectively using (1) pure warble tone thresholds, (2) pure-tone average (PTA4), (3) speech discrimination score (SDS) in quiet, and (4) speech reception threshold 50% at 70 dB SPL noise level (SRT50%). Subjective benefit was evaluated by three validated questionnaires: (1) the IOI-HA, (2) the SSQ-12, and (3) a questionnaire evaluating both the frequency and the duration of hearing aid usage. The mean aided PTA4 was lowered by 14.7 dB. SDS was increased by 37.5% at 50 dB SPL, SRT50% in noise improved 1.4 dB. Aided thresholds improved insignificantly at frequencies above 2 kHz. 52.9% of the patients used their device every day, and 76.5% used the device at least 5 days a week. Mean IOI-HA score was 3.4, corresponding to a good benefit. In SSQ-12, &quot;quality of hearing&quot; scored especially high. Patients with a conductive and/or mixed hearing loss benefitted the most. This device demonstrates a significant subjective hearing benefit 8 month post surgery. In patients with conductive and/or mixed hearing losses, patient satisfaction and frequency of use were high. Objective gain measures showed less promising results especially in patients with single-sided deafness (SSD) compared to other bone conduction devices."
