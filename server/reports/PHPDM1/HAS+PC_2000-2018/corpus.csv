"10981596","The role of generic health-related quality of life measures in establishing audiological rehabilitation outcomes.","OBJECTIVE: To review the status of generic functional health measures used with hearing-impaired adults and to summarize the findings of studies that have utilized these outcome measures to assess the benefit of amplification.DESIGN: Four basic generic quality of life measures used with the hearing-impaired population for determining hearing aid benefit are reviewed and discussed. The measures include the Sickness Impact Profile, the Self Evaluation of Life Function, the Medical Outcomes Study, and the Dartmouth COOP Functional Health Assessment Charts.RESULTS: The review of studies concerned with quality of life measures revealed that present day functional health status tools lack the necessary sensitivity to detect clinically meaningful improvements in patients with hearing impairment.CONCLUSIONS: Although we have good reason to believe that hearing aids improve quality of life, available functional health status measures lack the appropriate sensitivity to be used for assessing the benefit of amplification in individuals with hearing impairment. There is an urgent need for additional research to address this important area."
"11587599","Randomized trial of amplification strategies.","BACKGROUND: Little is known about quality of life after the use of specific types of hearing aids, so it is difficult to determine whether technologies such as programmable circuits and directional microphones are worth the added expense.OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of an assistive listening device, a nonprogrammable nondirectional microphone hearing aid, with that of a programmable directional microphone hearing aid against the absence of amplification.DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.SETTING: Audiology clinic at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, Wash.PATIENTS: Sixty veterans with bilateral moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss completed the trial. Half the veterans (n = 30) had hearing loss that the Veterans Affairs clinic determined was rated as &quot;service connected,&quot; which meant that they were eligible for Veterans Affairs-issued hearing aids.INTERVENTION: Veterans with non-service-connected hearing loss, who were ineligible for Veterans Affairs-issued hearing aids, were randomly assigned to no amplification (control arm) or to receive an assistive listening device. Veterans with service-connected loss were randomly assigned to receive either the nonprogrammable hearing aid that is routinely issued (&quot;conventional&quot;) or a programmable aid with a directional microphone (&quot;programmable&quot;).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hearing-related quality of life, self-rated communication ability, adherence to use, and willingness to pay for the amplification devices (measured 3 months after fitting).RESULTS: Clear distinctions were observed between all 4 arms. The mean improvement in hearing-related quality of life (Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly) scores was small for control patients (2.2 points) and patients who received an assistive listening device (4.4 points), excellent for patients who received a conventional device (17.4 points), and substantial for patients who received a programmable device (31.1 points) (P&lt;.001 by the analysis of variance test). Qualitative analyses of free-text diary entries, self-reported communication ability (Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit) scores, adherence to hearing aid use, and willingness to pay for replacement devices showed similar trends.CONCLUSIONS: A programmable hearing aid with a directional microphone had the highest level of effectiveness in the veteran population. A nonprogrammable hearing aid with an omnidirectional microphone was also effective compared with an assistive listening device or no amplification."
"12391946","Development of a questionnaire to measure hearing-related health state preferences framed in an overall health perspective.","OBJECTIVES: The objective was to develop the Audiological Disabilities Preference Index (ADPI), a measure to determine health state preferences associated with audiological disabilities. The ADPI consists of a hearing-related health state description, hearing-related health state valuation, and transformation of the latter to the overall health scale. Research questions were: a) to determine the feasibility of ADPI in an older hearing-impaired population; b) to assess gain in health state preference after hearing aid fitting; c) to evaluate the reliability of ADPI using hypothetical health states; and d) to compare the results of ADPI with the EuroQol.METHODS: The ADPI, the marker states, and the EuroQol were administered to 78 first-time hearing aid users before and 12 and 25 weeks after hearing aid fitting.RESULTS: The ADPI was feasible in an older hearing-impaired population (mean age, 69.1 years). After hearing aid fitting, all dimensions of audiological disability improved (p &lt; .001). Change in hearing-specific health state and the latter framed in overall health were 0.27 and 0.12, respectively (p &lt; .001). The mean values of the marker states were stable, but the intraclass correlation coefficients were low. Correlations between ADPI and hearing loss and the EuroQol, respectively, were low, while moderate with hearing aid satisfaction. There was a slight change on the EuroQol visual analog scale, with only an improvement in the feeling dimension (p &lt; .05).CONCLUSIONS: The ADPI provides a practical and useful method to assess hearing-related health state preferences needed for clinical decision making and cost-effectiveness analysis."
"11758306","Dynamic modeling in medical technology assessment. Fitting hearing aids in The Netherlands.","OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this article is to demonstrate the usefulness of dynamic modeling for an economic assessment of technology in health care. Specifically, this approach is applied to assess the impact of the use of hearing aids in Dutch health care.METHODS: The population is divided into different health classes between which, over time, transitions occur. Transition probabilities are derived from exogenous data. The transitions are associated with economic and societal costs and benefits. People who are satisfied with their hearing aids experience benefits. These benefits are expressed by quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs are made during transitions (mainly the fitting of hearing aids). A cohort analysis is carried out, starting with people in a particular age group. The starting point is a fixed number of people within this age group, who are followed during their whole lifetime.RESULTS: Costs per QALY ratios are calculated for two health programs. The Fitting Hearing Aid Program describes the present situation in the Netherlands; the Post-purchase Counseling Hearing Aid Program is a hypothetical addition to the first program, where an intervention based on a Dutch study is undertaken to improve satisfaction with hearing aids. Future benefits and costs are discounted at a rate of 5%.CONCLUSIONS: The dynamic modeling approach provides a more realistic picture than a static approach. Particularly, the cost-effectiveness of the Fitting Hearing Aid Program is compared with the Post-purchase Counseling Hearing Aid Program."
"12680823","Reasons for referral and attitudes toward hearing aids: do they affect outcome?","Many patients attending for a hearing aid are not self motivated, but in the majority of cases motivated by a relative. In this study, we have examined whether the reason for referral (self motivated or other) and the attitude toward a hearing aid at assessment affect outcome measures. One hundred and forty first-time hearing aid users were assessed at their initial hearing aid consultation and at review 3 months later. The reason for referral was not found to affect outcome measures. However, attitude towards a hearing aid was found to be significantly related to both satisfaction with it and its use at review. The importance of the attitude toward a hearing aid supports previous work and reiterates the importance of tailoring auditory rehabilitation towards the needs of the individual."
"15372170","[Identifying factors before the provision of hearing aids. Results from a pilot study].","OBJECTIVE: Systematic research on factors before the provision of hearing aids is scarce. In order to identify parameters which promote or impede the use of hearing aids, a questionnaire-based survey was conducted.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 35 randomly chosen, hard of hearing adults indicated for a hearing aid were examined. The importance of speech in quiet and in noise, wearing comfort, sound quality, appearance and costs, as well as expectations, willingness to use a hearing aid and reasons for and against provision were determined.RESULTS: Speech in noise and quiet were most important, followed by comfort of wearing and appearance of the aid. Expectations towards the hearing aids were in general high. The willingness to use hearing devices was positively affected by the expectation that it would improve quality of life and negatively by the amount of social activity of the person. The main reasons against the use of hearing aids were appearance and lack of confidence in hearing aid technology.CONCLUSIONS: This pilot-study identified several parameters which might affect willingness to use hearing aids. In particular, expectations towards the aids, personal attitude towards hearing and communication problems and the appearance of hearing aids should be subject to further examination."
"17943685","Effectiveness of group versus individual hearing aid visits.","Demand for hearing aid services in the Veterans Health Administration increased over 300% from 1996 to 2005, challenging the delivery of timely, high-quality care. Using group visits may help meet these needs, but whether this approach would still provide high-quality rehabilitation is unclear. This study determined whether group visits worsen hearing aid outcomes. It included a retrospective observational cohort in veterans seeking hearing aids at the Department of Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System from September 2004 to March 2005, when the clinic was using both individual and group visits. Medical records were reviewed for all new hearing aid patients seen during this period. Hearing-related outcome questionnaires were compared between patients seen for individual versus group fitting and/or follow-up visits. Results revealed that hearing thresholds were similar between patients seen individually and in groups. Of 74 patients who returned self-administered questionnaires after the follow-up, those who received both fitting and follow-up in a group format reported similar hearing handicap and better hearing-related function, satisfaction, and adherence than patients who received individual visits. Group visits did not appear to yield worse outcomes in this nonrandomized retrospective chart review. Definitive statements must await randomized comparisons."
"19363721","Pilot study: Efficacy of recalling adult hearing-aid users for reassessment after three years within a publicly-funded audiology service.","Routine recall for reassessment of adult hearing-aid users has been recommended by national audiology standards in the United Kingdom. The objective of this study was to determine whether recalling patients after three years was appropriate within a publicly-funded health service model, by investigating changes in hearing thresholds, and problems presented by adult hearing-aid users at reassessment appointments. Patients who had not had contact (except for the repair service) with the department for three years or more were invited to participate in the pilot reassessment programme, and 62% attended (total of 95 subjects). The reassessment appointment was found to be clearly appropriate for 58% of subjects seen, using our defined criteria. 100% of subjects were also found to need minor interventions. It is suggested that recall for reassessment after three years was generally appropriate for this patient group whose needs were not adequately met by self-referral and repair services. Some evidence was also found that subjects who have not accessed open repair clinics might be suitable for targeting for reassessment appointments."
"19253813","Hearing aids for Ménière's syndrome: implications of hearing fluctuation.","BACKGROUND: Hearing fluctuation imposes the biggest challenge in the fitting of hearing aids for patients with Ménière's syndrome.PURPOSE: This study shows that the problem maybe be overcome by allowing the patients to test their own hearing and to program their own hearing aids to adjust for hearing fluctuation. RESEARCH DESIGN AND STUDY SAMPLE: A group of 40 participants diagnosed with Ménère's syndrome were fitted with Widex Senso Diva hearing aids and were provided with a portable Senso Programmer 3 (SP3) that allowed them to measure their own hearing thresholds at up to 14 different frequencies and to program their own devices.INTERVENTION: The participants were instructed to test their hearing three times a day for 8 weeks and to program their hearing aids according to the measured thresholds.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: All participants recorded some degree of hearing fluctuation during the 8-week trial.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Among participants, 70 percent continued to program their hearing aids on a regular basis and reported great satisfaction with amplification because they are now able to adjust their own devices when their hearing fluctuates."
"21109549","Factors influencing help seeking, hearing aid uptake, hearing aid use and satisfaction with hearing aids: a review of the literature.","OBJECTIVES: This descriptive summary of the literature provides an overview of the available studies (published between January 1980 and January 2009) on correlates of help-seeking behavior for hearing loss, hearing-aid uptake, hearing-aid use, and satisfaction with the device.METHODS: Publications were identified by structured searches in Pubmed and Cinahl and by inspecting the reference lists of relevant articles. The articles covered different stages that a person with hearing impairment may go through: prior to hearing aid fitting, the period covering the fitting and the period post hearing aid fitting. Inclusion of articles occurred according to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were extracted by two independent researchers. Thirty-nine papers were included that identified 31 factors examined in relation to the four outcome measures. These covered personal factors (e.g., source of motivation, expectation, attitude), demographic factors (e.g., age, gender) and external factors (e.g., cost, counseling). Only two studies covered the actual fitting process. There was only one factor positively affecting all four outcome variables. This was self-reported hearing disability. The vast majority of studies showed no relationship of age and gender with any of the outcome domains.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Whereas research of the last 28 years yielded valuable information regarding relevant and irrelevant factors in hearing aid health care, there are still many relevant issues that have never been investigated in controlled studies. These are discussed."
"20890203","Preference for one or two hearing AIDS among adult patients.","OBJECTIVES: Most practitioners believe that use of two hearing aids is the ideal fitting for adults with bilateral symmetrical hearing loss. However, previous research has consistently shown that a substantial proportion of these patients actually prefer to use only one hearing aid. This study explored whether this pattern of preferences is seen with technologically advanced hearing aids. In addition, a selection of variables that were available prefitting were used to attempt to predict which patients will prefer one hearing aid rather than two.DESIGN: The study was designed as a 12-week field trial including structured and unstructured use of one and two hearing aids. Ninety-four subjects with mild to moderate bilaterally symmetrical hearing loss were bilaterally fit with 2005-2007 era hearing aids. Potential predictors included demographic, audiometric, auditory lifestyle, personality, and binaural processing variables. After the field trial, each subject stated his or her preference for one or two hearing aids and completed three self-report outcome questionnaires for their preferred fitting.RESULTS: Previous research was confirmed with modern technology hearing aids: after the field trial, 46% of the subjects preferred to use one hearing aid rather than two. Subjects who preferred two hearing aids tended to report better real-world outcomes than those who preferred one. Subjects who reported more hearing problems in daily life, who experienced more binaural loudness summation, and whose ears were more equivalent in dichotic listening were more likely to prefer to use two hearing aids. Contrary to conventional wisdom (ideas that are generally accepted as true), audiometric hearing loss and auditory lifestyle were not predictive of aiding preference. However, the best predictive approach from these data yielded accurate predictions for only two-thirds of the subjects.CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based practice calls for a conscientious melding of current evidence, clinical judgment, and patient preferences. The results of this research challenge practitioners to recognize that many patients who seem to be ideal candidates for bilateral aiding will actually prefer to wear only one hearing aid. Furthermore, at this time, there is no accurate method that will predict which patients will prefer one hearing aid rather than two. At present, the most effective approach open to practitioners would be to conduct a candid unbiased systematic field trial allowing each patient to compare unilateral and bilateral fittings in daily life. This might necessitate more fitting sessions and could perhaps add to the practitioner's burden. This downside should be weighed against the additional patient satisfaction that can be anticipated as a result of transparency in the fitting protocol, collaboration with the patient in the treatment decisions, and the knowledge of selecting the most cost-effective patient-centered solution."
"21916818","International outcome inventory for hearing aids (IOI-HA): results from the Chinese version.","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to present normative data on the Chinese version of the international outcome inventory for hearing aids (IOI-HA) and examine the effectiveness of the hearing aid service.DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. The IOI-HA was administered in a paper and pencil format.STUDY SAMPLE: The IOI-HA and self-designed questionnaire were mailed to 1502 experienced hearing-aid users who received their hearing aids from 14 hearing service centers in mainland China. In all, 1049 completed responses were included in the final analysis, and descriptive statistics were reported.RESULTS: The mean scores of each item of the IOI-HA ranged from 3.55 to 4.16. The IOI-HA scores showed a skewed distribution, with the maximum frequency for a score of 4 or 5. The total IOI-HA scores ranged from 9 to 35, and the mean total score was 26.3. The results compared favorably with the previous reports, and slightly higher than the published norms, indicating a high level of self-reported outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: The IOI-HA could be used as an effective tool to measure the general effectiveness of the hearing aid outcomes in China. The implementation of the IOI-HA is time-efficient, imposing little burden on the clinician and patient."
"21329261","Self-reported outcomes of aural rehabilitation for adult hearing aid users in a South African context.","Hearing impairment has far-reaching consequences for affected individuals, in terms of quality of life indicators. In the public health care sector of South Africa the hearing-impaired population is faced with limited aural rehabilitation services. This study evaluated self-reported outcomes of aural rehabilitation in a group of adults in the public health care sector with a standardised outcomes measurement tool (IOI-HA). Sixty-one participants were included (44% male; sample mean age 69.7 years) through face-to-face or telephonic interviews. Results revealed that the average perceived outcome of participants (5 = best outcome; 1 = poorest outcome) was positive across all domains of the inventory including daily use of hearing aids (4.3); benefits provided by hearing aids (4.3); residual activity limitation (3.9); satisfaction with hearing aids (4.5); residual participation restriction (4.0); impact of hearing difficulties on others (4.6); and changes in quality of life (4.5). Statistically significant relationships for daily use of hearing aids, degree of hearing loss, type of hearing aids fitted, and the perceived benefit from hearing aids in difficult listening environments (p&lt;0.05) were evident. Adult aural rehabilitation for hearing loss in a public health care facility, even without optimal hearing aid fittings, was effective in providing positive perceived outcomes comparable to similar studies in developed countries. The findings advocate for the initiation of affordable and sustainable aural rehabilitation services in developing countries despite apparent resource limitations."
"23108823","Satisfaction of patients fit with a hearing aid in a high complexity clinic.","The process of selecting and fitting hearing aid devices is only effective and only bring about good outcomes if the individual makes effective use of the device. Therefore, the individuals need to be happy with the outcome.</AbstractText>: The process of selecting and fitting hearing aid devices is only effective and only bring about good outcomes if the individual makes effective use of the device. Therefore, the individuals need to be happy with the outcome.AIM: To check the satisfaction of adults and elderly patients concerning their hearing aid in a high complex care clinic accredited by the Unified Health System, and to correlate this outcome with the variables related to age, gender, fitting period, daily use, as well as the type of sound amplifying device.METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study in which 60 subjects were evaluated using the questionnaire: Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life, applied by means of oral presentation, in individual interviews by the researcher. This instrument is divided into subscales: positive effects, service and costs, negative factors and personal image.RESULTS: It was shown that the subjects of this study were very happy with the use of hearing aid devices. There was significant difference in relating the daily use of the devices with the overall satisfaction score and subscale of personal image.CONCLUSION: It was found that the subjects of the study were very happy with the use of hearing aids, although satisfaction was not related to the variables: age, gender, time of use and device type. In general, participants with higher daily use are happier."
"23072178","Presbycusis, part 1: can you hear the music of life?","We used a novel approach allowing participants in this study to self-monitor their hearing sensitivity to familiar sounds in the environment. The objective of this approach was to establish whether participants in the 80-89 and 90-99 age groups would recognize the degree of their hearing impairment. It was our hope that participants would value audiology treatment and that it would improve their quality of life over a short period. The pilot study took place in a clinical environment where participants answered survey questions before and after audiology treatment, which pertained to their hearing impairment, morale, social support, and life satisfaction. Caregivers were included in the research to rate and record participants' problem behaviors (e.g., shouting, anger, agitation, repetitive speech dialog, and depression) before, during, and after treatment. This research validates other scientists' findings that annoying problem behaviors may actually be the result of hearing loss because of a person's inability to recognize speech. The pilot study shows that participants with mild dementia adapted well to speech and sounds in the natural environment without agitation as well as to management of hearing aids within a 30-day period. The participants with moderate dementia were slower to adapt. All participants with dementia required the cooperation of their caregivers to maintain hygiene of ear canals and hearing aids and insertion. This study suggests that the sooner people receive treatment for hearing loss, the quicker they are to recognize speech and to master hearing aid technology."
"22812927","Hearing-aid counseling: comparison of single-session informational counseling with single-session performance-perceptual counseling.","OBJECTIVE: Hearing-aid counseling can improve outcome but programs are often too resource-intensive to be clinically practical. Here we examined the effectiveness of single-session informational counseling with single-session performance-perceptual counseling.DESIGN: Two forms of counseling were compared: informational counseling (IC) and performance-perceptual counseling (PPC). IC focused on discussing communication strategies and tips for hearing-aid use. PPC addressed the discrepancy between measured and perceived ability to understand speech. Outcomes were measured eight-to-ten weeks post-counseling using quantitative and qualitative measures: Hearing handicap inventory, abbreviated profile of hearing aid benefit, psychosocial impact of assistive devices scale (PIADS), international outcome inventory for hearing aids, and a semi-structured exit interview.STUDY SAMPLE: Seventy-four hearing aid-users with symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss participated.RESULTS: Scores on the hearing questionnaires showed no change following either form of counseling. Scores on the PIADS improved for participants as a whole, and the semi-structured interview revealed increased hearing-aid use, better understanding and acceptance of hearing loss, increased use of communication strategies, and improved ability to explain hearing difficulties to others.CONCLUSIONS: A single session of hearing-aid counseling can improve hearing-aid use and satisfaction. Open-ended interview and/or quality of life measures are more sensitive to these benefits than hearing questionnaires."
"23856912","The SoundBite hearing system: patient-assessed safety and benefit study.","HYPOTHESIS: To determine the safety and efficacy of the SoundBite for patients over a 6 month period of use.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, multisite, nonrandomized patient enrollment with outcomes based on audiometric profile and self-reported assessment.METHODS: Patients with single-sided deafness were eligible for the study. Patients were fit with the standard SoundBite sound transducer and were asked to wear the device regularly for 6 months. At the end of the trial period, patients completed both a self-assessment and the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) questionnaires.RESULTS: Thirty-four subjects completed the study. Mean APHAB scores improved significantly for ease of communication (P &lt; 0.001), background noise (P &lt; 0.001), reverberation (P &lt; 0.001), and global benefit (P &lt; 0.001). Patients reported high rates of auditory benefit in a variety of listening situations and high rates of overall satisfaction with the device. One adverse event with a superficial mouth sore was reported and resolved after appropriate dental care. Twelve patients (35%) reported acoustic feedback. In six of these patients, the feedback resolved after device adjustment.CONCLUSION: The SoundBite is a new hearing prosthesis that delivers bone conduction energy. It offers advantages over traditional osseointegrated devices that require surgical placement. Patient satisfaction with the device after 6 months of regular use is high. The SoundBite provided improvement in ease of communication, hearing in background noise, sound reverberation, and an overall global hearing benefit. Acoustic feedback is the most commonly reported problem with the SoundBite, and this is minimized with proper fitting."
"23506664","Client labor: adults with hearing impairment describing their participation in their hearing help-seeking and rehabilitation.","BACKGROUND: The uptake and use of hearing aids is low compared to the prevalence of hearing impairment. People who seek help and take part in a hearing aid rehabilitation process participate actively in this process in several ways.PURPOSE: In order to gain more knowledge on the challenges of hearing help-seeking and hearing aid use, this qualitative study sought to understand the ways that people with hearing impairment describe themselves as active participants throughout the hearing aid rehabilitation process.RESEARCH DESIGN: In this qualitative interview study we examined the hearing rehabilitation process from the perspective of the hearing impaired. In this article we describe how the qualitative interview material was interpreted by a pragmatic qualitative thematic analysis. The analysis described in this article focused on the efforts, initiatives, actions, and participation the study participants described that they had engaged in during their rehabilitation.STUDY SAMPLE: Interviews were conducted with people with hearing impairment in Australia, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The 34 interview participants were distributed equally between the sites, just as men and women were almost equally represented (56% women). The average age of the participants was 64. All participants had a hearing impairment in at least one ear. The participants were recruited to represent a range of experiences with hearing help-seeking and rehabilitation.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: With each participant one qualitative semistructured interview ranging between 1 and 2 hr was carried out. The interviews were transcribed verbatim, read through several times, and themes were identified, defined, and reviewed by an iterative process.RESULTS: From this thematic focus a concept called &quot;client labor&quot; has emerged. Client labor contains nine subthemes divided into three overarching groups: cognitive labor, emotional labor, and physical labor. The participants' experiences and meaning-making related to these conceptual types of efforts is described.CONCLUSIONS: The study findings have implications for the clinical encounter between people with hearing impairment and hearing health-care professionals. We suggest that a patient-centered approach that bears in mind the client's active participation could help toward improving clinical dispensing, fitting, and counseling practices with the end goal to increase hearing aid benefit and satisfaction."
"25262671","Perceptions of adults with hearing impairment regarding the promotion of trust in hearing healthcare service delivery.","OBJECTIVE: This paper describes how trust is promoted in adults with hearing impairment within the context of hearing healthcare (HHC) service delivery.DESIGN: Data were analysed from a previously published descriptive qualitative study that explored perspectives of adults with hearing impairment on hearing help-seeking and rehabilitation.STUDY SAMPLE: Interview transcripts from 29 adults from four countries with different levels of hearing impairment and different experience with the HHC system were analysed thematically.RESULTS: Patients enter into the HHC system with service expectations resulting in a preconceived level of trust that can vary from low to high. Relational competence, technical competence, commercialized approach, and clinical environment (relevant to both the clinician and the clinic) influence a patient's resulting level of trust.CONCLUSIONS: Trust is evolving rather than static in HHC: Both clinicians and clinics can promote trust. The characteristics of HHC that engender trust are: practicing good communication, supporting shared decision making, displaying technical competence, offering comprehensive hearing rehabilitation, promoting self-management, avoiding a focus on hearing-aid sales, and offering a professional clinic setting."
"25147224","Assistive technology provision within the Navajo Nation: user and provider perceptions.","In this study we explored the factors that affect assistive technology (AT) provision within the Navajo Nation using a qualitative approach to inquiry. Focus groups were held in which AT users discussed their awareness of AT and their need for, use of, and satisfaction with AT devices and services. Twenty-eight individuals who used wheelchairs, orthotics or prosthetics, hearing aids, communication aids, vision aids, and other AT participated in one of seven focus groups. Seven AT providers discussed the facilitators and barriers that affect AT provision. The findings revealed six themes common to both stakeholder groups and two additional themes for AT users. The central theme for AT users centered on (not) feeling understood; the central theme for AT providers revolved around the processes, activities, and roles the providers engaged in at times for different clients. Activities to increase awareness and to promote successful AT provision and satisfaction with AT devices were proposed. "
"24828222","A preliminary evaluation of the active communication education program in a sample of 87-year-old hearing impaired individuals.","BACKGROUND: Previous research suggests that audiological rehabilitation for older adults could include group communication programs in addition to hearing aid fitting or as an alternative to hearing aid fitting for those people who do not wish to proceed with hearing aids. This pilot study was a first attempt to evaluate a Swedish version of such a program, Active Communication Education (ACE), which had been developed and previously evaluated in Australia (Hickson et al, 2007a).PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to explore the use of the ACE program in an older-old population of people aged 87 yr in Sweden.RESEARCH DESIGN: A within-subject intervention study.STUDY SAMPLE: The participants were recruited from the Elderly in Linköping Screening Assessment (ELSA), a population-based study of the functional abilities of all inhabitants of the city of Linkoping aged 85 yr in 2007. Participants who responded to the hearing related items in the ELSA study were approached for this study; 29 people agreed to undertake ACE, and 23 (79%) completed three or more sessions.INTERVENTION: The ACE program consists of five weekly 2 hr group sessions with six to ten participants per group.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Self-report measures of communication strategy use, activity and participation, health-related quality of life, and depression were obtained preprogram, 3 wk postprogram, and 6 mo postprogram. Within-group changes and effect sizes were calculated. In addition, outcomes were measured postprogram using the International Outcome Inventory-Alternative Interventions (IOI-AI; Noble, 2002) and a modified version of the Client Oriented Scale of Improvement (COSI; Dillon et al, 1997; Hickson et al, 2007b), and qualitative feedback was obtained.RESULTS: The effect size of ACE was small (0.03-0.27), and, in the sample of 23 included in this pilot study, differences in pre- and postprogram assessments were not statistically significant. Results from the IOI-AI and the modified COSI indicated that these elderly participants found the program to be beneficial, and 90% stated that the course had increased their ability to deal with hearing loss and the problems it creates.CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary investigation indicates the potential benefits of ACE for older adults, and further research is needed with larger numbers of participants in different age groups to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the ACE program for a general Swedish population."
"26565785","A Randomized Controlled Trial to Evaluate the Benefits of a Multimedia Educational Program for First-Time Hearing Aid Users.","OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to (1) develop a series of short interactive videos (or reusable learning objects [RLOs]) covering a broad range of practical and psychosocial issues relevant to the auditory rehabilitation for first-time hearing aid users; (2) establish the accessibility, take-up, acceptability and adherence of the RLOs; and (3) assess the benefits and cost-effectiveness of the RLOs.DESIGN: The study was a single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial with two arms. The intervention group (RLO+, n = 103) received the RLOs plus standard clinical service including hearing aid(s) and counseling, and the waitlist control group (RLO-, n = 100) received standard clinical service only. The effectiveness of the RLOs was assessed 6-weeks posthearing aid fitting. Seven RLOs (total duration 1 hr) were developed using a participatory, community of practice approach involving hearing aid users and audiologists. RLOs included video clips, illustrations, animations, photos, sounds and testimonials, and all were subtitled. RLOs were delivered through DVD for TV (50.6%) and PC (15.2%), or via the internet (32.9%).RESULTS: RLO take-up was 78%. Adherence overall was at least 67%, and 97% in those who attended the 6-week follow-up. Half the participants watched the RLOs two or more times, suggesting self-management of their hearing loss, hearing aids, and communication. The RLOs were rated as highly useful and the majority of participants agreed the RLOs were enjoyable, improved their confidence and were preferable to written information. Postfitting, there was no significant between-group difference in the primary outcome measure, overall hearing aid use. However, there was significantly greater hearing aid use in the RLO+ group for suboptimal users. Furthermore, the RLO+ group had significantly better knowledge of practical and psychosocial issues, and significantly better practical hearing aid skills than the RLO- group.CONCLUSIONS: The RLOs were shown to be beneficial to first-time hearing aid users across a range of quantitative and qualitative measures. This study provides evidence to suggest that the RLOs may provide valuable learning and educational support for first-time hearing aid users and could be used to supplement clinical rehabilitation practice."
"25885193","Self-reported outcomes after hearing aid fitting in Minas Gerais, Brazil.","PURPOSE: To analyze the self-reported outcomes after hearing aid fitting among individuals in the northern region of Minas Gerais and associated factors.METHODS: A cross-sectional and analytical study with a random sample of adults and elderly attending the public health care service was conducted in the northern region of Minas Gerais (86 municipalities), Brazil. Study's participants answered International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA) questionnaires. Data were analyzed descriptively and analytically with Poisson regression analysis.RESULTS: We interviewed 272 adults and 112 individuals reported not using their hearing aids regularly. The mean of IOI-HA global score was lower than expected. The individual's relationship with their hearing aid (Factor 1) was worse than the individual's relationship with their environment (Factor 2). Lower global scores were statistically associated with no work.CONCLUSIONS: The observed scores for the study's population are lower than those recorded in other studies. The results suggest that there are limitations in the fitting and follow-up of individuals who received hearing aids."
"25811932","Exploring the Effects of the Narrative Embodied in the Hearing Aid Fitting Process on Treatment Outcomes.","OBJECTIVES: There is strong evidence from other fields of health, and growing evidence in audiology, that characteristics of the process of intervention as perceived by the client (embodied narratives) can have significant effects on treatment outcomes, independent of the technical properties of the intervention itself. This phenomenon deserves examination because studies of technical interventions that fail to take account of it may reach erroneous conclusions and because clinical practice can put such effects to therapeutic use. The aim of this study was to test the idea that embodied narratives might affect outcomes in hearing aid fitting. This was achieved by carrying out experiments in which technical (acoustic) differences between alternative hearing aid fittings were absent, while providing test subjects with a strong contrast between the processes apparently applied to derive the fittings being compared. Thus, any effects of contrasting narratives could be observed, free of acoustical confounds. The hypothesis was that narrative effects would be observed.DESIGN: A balanced crossover design was used, in which subjects received and evaluated two bilateral hearing aid fittings in succession. Subjects were deceived as to the true identical content of the hearing aid fittings being compared, but encouraged to believe that one fitting process was &quot;interactive&quot; and the other was &quot;diagnostic&quot; in character. Two almost identical experiments were undertaken: one with 24 experienced adult hearing aid users and another with 16 adult first-time users. Each hearing aid fitting was worn at home for 2 weeks, after which self-report outcome measures (Hearing Aid Performance Questionnaire, Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly, and International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids) were administered. After the second test period, a short preference questionnaire was also completed.RESULTS: Twenty of the 24 experienced users showed a clear preference for one or the other fitting, and their self-report scores reflected these preferences. Effect sizes were comparable with those typically observed for true acoustical contrasts. No order effect was seen in this group. In contrast, 13 of the 16 first-time users preferred the second fitting. Trends in the self-report measures were similar for this group but weaker than for the experienced users. In both groups, the reasons given for subjects' preference were predominantly related to sound, despite there being no acoustical differences.CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the narrative embodied in a given fitting process can have a substantial effect on the perceived benefit of the treatment, independent of any acoustical differences, at least for experienced users. For first-time users, acclimatization seems to overshadow the purely narrative effect of any fitting process. In the future, research study designs should include steps to avoid narrative effects when technical parameters of hearing aids are the intended object of study. In clinical practice, the narrative is part of the therapeutic context, and one may design it for maximum beneficial effect."
"25640403","Determinants of hearing-aid adoption and use among the elderly: a systematic review.","OBJECTIVE: While the benefits of hearing aids among older adults with presbycusis have been well documented, there is limited research on hearing-aid usage. The aim of this review is to synthesize current evidence to identify the determinants of hearing-aid adoption and use among the elderly.DESIGN: Systematic review.STUDY SAMPLE: Articles were identified through systematic searches in the Web of Science, Medline, CINAHL, and a manual search. Studies that explore the potential determinants of hearing-aid usage were to be included.RESULTS: A total of twenty-two articles were reviewed. Four audiological determinants (the severity of hearing loss, the type of hearing aids, background noise acceptance, and insertion gain) and seven non-audiological determinants (self-perceived hearing problems, expectation, demographics, group consultation, support from significant others, self-perceived benefit, and satisfaction) were identified as affecting the adoption and use of hearing aids.CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to explore the influence of significant others, health professionals, and user demographics on hearing rehabilitation for future research. The determinants identified in this review depicted the stage progression of the trans-theoretical model (TTM) in explaining an individual's readiness to hearing-aid usage."
"25597459","The nature of communication throughout diagnosis and management planning in initial audiologic rehabilitation consultations.","BACKGROUND: Effective practitioner-patient communication throughout diagnosis and management planning positively influences patient outcomes. A patient-centered approach whereby patient involvement in decision making is facilitated, a therapeutic relationship is developed, and information is bilaterally exchanged in an appropriate manner, leads to improved patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment, and self-management. Despite this knowledge, little is known about the nature of audiologist-patient communication throughout diagnosis and management planning.PURPOSE: This research aimed to explore verbal communication between audiologists and patients/companions throughout diagnosis and management planning in initial audiology consultations. Specifically, this study aimed to describe the nature and dynamics of communication by examining the number, proportion, and type of verbal utterances by all speakers (audiologist, patient, and companion when present). In addition, this study aimed to investigate the influence of audiologist, patient, and consultation factors, such as verbal dominance, content balance, and communication control, on the dynamics of communication.STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 62 initial audiological rehabilitation consultations (involving 26 different audiologists) were filmed and analyzed using the Roter Interaction Analysis System. All patients were older than 55 yr, and a companion was present in 17 consultations.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: This study focused solely on the communication relating to diagnosis and management planning (referred to as the &quot;counseling phase&quot;). Diagnosis, recommendations, rehabilitation options, and patient decisions were recorded along with the communication profiles and communication dynamics measured using the Roter Interaction Analysis System. Associations between communication dynamics (content balance, communication control, and verbal dominance) and eight variables were evaluated with Linear Mixed Model methods.RESULTS: The mean length of time for diagnosis and management planning was 29.0 min (range, 2.2-78.5 min). Communication profiles revealed that patient-centered communication was infrequently observed. First, opportunities to build a relationship were missed, such that patients' psychosocial concerns were rarely addressed and patients/companions showed little involvement in management planning. Second, the amount of talk was asymmetrical and the majority of audiologists' education and counseling utterances related to hearing aids; yet, only 56% of patients decided to obtain hearing aids at the conclusion of the consultation. Hearing aids were recommended in 83% of consultations where a hearing loss was diagnosed and alternative options were rarely provided. Thus, shared decision making rarely occurred, and audiologists often diagnosed a hearing loss and recommended hearing aids without patient involvement. In addition, when a greater proportion of time was dedicated to diagnosis and management planning, patients had greater input and control by asking more questions and requesting further information.CONCLUSIONS: Patient-centered communication was rarely observed in the 62 consultations. Thus, although not measured in this study, patient outcomes are likely to be affected. Future research should examine the influence of audiologist communication on outcomes and encourage a shift toward patient-centered audiological rehabilitation."
"27564444","Motivational Interviewing as an Adjunct to Hearing Rehabilitation for Patients with Tinnitus: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial.","PURPOSE: To test the effects of a brief motivational interviewing (MI) program as an adjunct to hearing aid rehabilitation for patients with tinnitus and sensorineural hearing loss.RESEARCH DESIGN: This was a pilot randomized controlled trial.STUDY SAMPLE: The sample consisted of 50 patients aged between 40 and 82 yr with both tinnitus and sensorineural hearing loss and a pure-tone average (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz) &lt; 70 dB HL. All patients were first-time hearing aid users.INTERVENTION: A brief MI program was used during hearing aid fitting in 25 patients, whereas the remainder received standard practice (SP), with conventional hearing rehabilitation.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A total of 46 patients (N = 23 + 23) with tinnitus were included for further analysis. The Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) and the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA) were administered before and after rehabilitation. THI was used to investigate changes in tinnitus annoyance, and the IOI-HA was used to determine the effect of hearing aid treatment.RESULTS: Self-reported tinnitus disability (THI) decreased significantly in the MI group (p &lt; 0.001) and in the SP group (p &lt; 0.006). However, there was greater improvement in the MI group (p &lt; 0.013). Furthermore, the findings showed a significant improvement in patients' satisfaction concerning the hearing aids (IOI-HA, within both groups; MI group, p &lt; 0.038; and SP group, p &lt; 0.026), with no difference between the groups (p &lt; 0.99).CONCLUSION: Tinnitus handicap scores decrease to a greater extent following brief MI than following SP. Future research on the value of incorporating MI into audiological rehabilitation using randomized controlled designs is required."

"28590895","A Qualitative Case Study of Smartphone-Connected Hearing Aids: Influences on Patients, Clinicians, and Patient-Clinician Interactions.","BACKGROUND: Innovations in hearing aid technology influence clinicians and individuals who use hearing aids. Little research, to date, explains the innovation adoption experiences and perspectives of clinicians and patients, which matter to a field like audiology, wherein technology innovation is constant. By understanding clinician and patient experiences with such innovations, the field of audiology may develop technologies and ways of practicing in a manner more responsive to patients' needs, and attentive to society's influence.PURPOSE: The authors aimed to understand how new innovations influence clinician and patient experiences, through a study focusing on connected hearing aids. &quot;Connected&quot; refers to the wireless functional connection of hearing aids with everyday technologies like mobile phones and tablets.RESEARCH DESIGN: The authors used a qualitative collective case study methodology, borrowing from constructivist grounded theory for data collection and analysis methods. Specifically, the authors designed a collective case study of a connected hearing aid and smartphone application, composed of two cases of experience with the innovation: the case of clinician experiences, and the case of patient experiences.STUDY SAMPLE: The qualitative sampling methods employed were case sampling, purposive within-case sampling, and theoretical sampling, and culminated in a total collective case n = 19 (clinician case n = 8; patient case n = 11). These data were triangulated with a supplementary sample of ten documents: relevant news and popular media collected during the study time frame.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The authors conducted interviews with the patients and clinicians, and analyzed the interview and document data using the constant comparative method. The authors compared their two cases by looking at trends within, between, and across cases.RESULTS: The clinician case highlighted clinicians' heuristic-based candidacy judgments in response to the adoption of the connected hearing aids into their practice. The patient case revealed patients' perceptions of themselves as technologically competent or incompetent, and descriptions of how they learned to use the new technology. Between cases, the study found a difference in the response to how the connected hearing aid changed the clinician-patient relationship. While clinicians valued the increased time they spent &quot;getting to know&quot; their patients, patients experienced some frustration specific to the additional troubleshooting related to Bluetooth connectivity. Across cases, there was a resounding theme of &quot;normalization&quot; of hearing aids via their integration with a &quot;normal&quot; technology (mobile phones) and general lack of concern about privacy in relation to the smartphone application and its tracking and geotagging features. Both audiologists and patients credited the connected hearing aids with increased opportunities to participate more fully in everyday life.CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of smartphone-connected hearing aids influenced the identities and candidate profiles of hearing aid users, and the nature of time spent in clinical interactions, in important and interesting ways. The influence of connected hearing aids on patient experience and audiology practice calls for continued research and clinical consideration, with implications for clinical decision-making regarding hearing aid candidacy. Further study should look critically at normalization and possible unintended stigmatizing effects of making hearing aids increasingly discreet."
"28553093","Applications of direct-to-consumer hearing devices for adults with hearing loss: a review.","BACKGROUND: This systematic literature review is aimed at investigating applications of direct-to-consumer hearing devices for adults with hearing loss. This review discusses three categories of direct-to-consumer hearing devices: 1) personal sound amplification products (PSAPs), 2) direct-mail hearing aids, and 3) over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids.METHOD: A literature review was conducted using EBSCOhost and included the databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. After applying prior agreed inclusion and exclusion criteria, 13 reports were included in the review.RESULTS: Included studies fell into three domains: 1) electroacoustic characteristics, 2) consumer surveys, and 3) outcome evaluations. Electroacoustic characteristics of these devices vary significantly with some meeting the stringent acoustic criteria used for hearing aids, while others producing dangerous output levels (ie, over 120-dB sound pressure level). Low-end (or low-cost) devices were typically poor in acoustic quality and did not meet gain levels necessary for most adult and elderly hearing loss patterns (eg, presbycusis), especially in high frequencies. Despite direct-mail hearing aids and PSAPs being associated with lower satisfaction when compared to hearing aids purchased through hearing health care professionals, consumer surveys suggest that 5%-19% of people with hearing loss purchase hearing aids through direct-mail or online. Studies on outcome evaluation suggest positive outcomes of OTC devices in the elderly population. Of note, OTC outcomes appear better when a hearing health care professional supports these users.CONCLUSION: While some direct-to-consumer hearing devices have the capability to produce adverse effects due to production of dangerously high sound levels and internal noise, the existing literature suggests that there are potential benefits of these devices. Research of direct-to-consumer hearing devices is limited, and current published studies are of weak quality. Much effort is needed to understand the benefits and limitations of such devices on people with hearing loss."

"29716438","Outcomes With a Self-Fitting Hearing Aid.","Self-fitting hearing aids (SFHAs)-devices that enable self-directed threshold measurements leading to a prescribed hearing aid (HA) setting, and fine-tuning, without the need for professional support-are now commercially available. This study examined outcomes obtained with one commercial SFHA, the Companion (SoundWorld Solutions), when support was available from a clinical assistant during self-fitting. Participants consisted of 27 experienced and 25 new HA users who completed the self-fitting process, resulting in 38 user-driven and 14 clinician-driven fittings. Following 12 weeks' experience with the SFHAs in the field, outcomes measured included the following: coupler gain and output, HA handling and management skills, speech recognition in noise, and self-reported benefit and satisfaction. In addition, the conventionally fitted HAs of 22 of the experienced participants who had user-driven fittings were evaluated. Irrespective of HA experience, the type of fitting (user- or clinician-driven) had no significant effect on coupler gain, speech recognition scores, or self-reported benefit and satisfaction. Users selected significantly higher low-frequency gain in the SFHAs when compared with the conventionally fitted HAs. The conventionally fitted HAs were rated significantly higher for benefit and satisfaction on some subscales due to negative issues with the physical design and implementation of the SFHAs, rather than who drove the fitting process. Poorer cognitive function was associated with poorer handling and management of the SFHAs. Findings suggest that with the right design and support, SFHAs may be a viable option to improve the accessibility of hearing health care."
"29488873","Description, Normative Data, and Utility of the Hearing Aid Skills and Knowledge Test.","BACKGROUND: The ability to manage hearing aids is crucial for successful outcomes and for maintaining hearing aid use. It is therefore important to have a tool that can effectively identify which hearing aid management skills are lacking so that the audiologist can provide additional education and training on that skill. Such a tool can also provide useful quantitative data for researchers.PURPOSE: To collect normative data (Experiment 1) and assess inter- and intrarater reliability (Experiment 2) for a hearing aid management assessment tool known as the Hearing Aid Skills and Knowledge (HASK) test.STUDY SAMPLE: Two hundred thirty-six new hearing aid users recruited from the VA Portland Health Care System and 126 experienced hearing aid users recruited from the local Portland community participated in Experiment 1. The veteran participants were taking part in a larger hearing aid study, and the community participants were recruited at community events that took place around Portland, OR. Three clinical audiologists and two AuD students completing their fourth year externship participated in Experiment 2.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: In Experiment 1, HASK data were collected from the new hearing aid users at 4-8 wk and 6-8 mo after the fitting of their first pair of hearing aids, and from experienced users on a single occasion. In addition, self-reported hearing aid use, benefit, and satisfaction were assessed for all participants. The audiologists/students in Experiment 2 watched and independently scored videos of six individuals completing the HASK. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) across audiologists were computed for HASK scores. Three audiologists/students rated at least one video on two occasions to provide interrater reliability data.RESULTS: Mean performance on the HASK was about 70% for knowledge and 80% for skills for both the new and experienced hearing aid users. Performance did not change among the new users between the 4-8 wk and 6-8 mo administration. The specific skills lacking were associated with advanced management abilities (cleaning and troubleshooting). Experiment 2 revealed ICCs for inter- and intrarater reliability for HASK to range from 0.76 to 0.94, showing acceptable to excellent reliability.CONCLUSIONS: The HASK is a quick and easy test with good-to-excellent inter- and intrarater reliability. It can effectively identify which hearing aid management skills are lacking so that the audiologist can provide additional education and training on those skills. Data show performance is ~70% for knowledge and 80% for skills and this does not change with hearing aid experience. The significant positive correlations between HASK scores and hearing aid use and satisfaction highlight the notion that ability to manage hearing aids successfully is integral to good hearing aid outcome."
