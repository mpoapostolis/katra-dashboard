"11527040","An investigation of the applicability of the inventory, satisfaction with amplification in daily life, at 2 weeks post hearing aid fitting.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the applicability of the self-report inventory, Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life (SADL), at 2 wk postfitting.DESIGN: The SADL was completed by two groups of hearing aid users, one fitted 2 wk before completion, the other at least 1 yr before. All SADLs were completed as a paper and pencil exercise, without involvement of an audiologist or other clinic staff. All the aid users were Government funded, all were fitted with the same model hearing aid, all were over the age of 60 yr, and all were fitted and counselled by the same two audiologists. Comparisons were made of the two groups' scores on each subscale and Global score, as well as on scores for each individual question.RESULTS: All scores for subscales, Global score, and individual questions were higher at 2 wk postfitting than at 1 yr. Significant differences were found for subscales Positive Effect (p &lt; 0.05), Service and Cost (p &lt; 0.025), Negative Features (p &lt; 0.001), as well as for the Global score (p &lt; 0.001). The only subscale not resulting in a significant difference was Personal Image (p &gt; 0.10). It was noted that Negative Features, such as background interference, acoustic feedback, and problems with telephone use, apparently take longer to be observed than Positive Effects such as improved communication and good sound quality. By contrast with some other reported studies, these results all display a reduction in self-reported outcome, rather than stability, or even improvement, over time. Among other possibilities, this finding may suggest the SADL measures something different to that measured by other inventories.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this investigation suggest that, if the aim is to predict long-term satisfaction with aid fitting, 2 wk postfitting is too early for meaningful application of the SADL as an outcome measure. It is possible that an earlier stability in SADL scores might be obtained by inclusion of additional questions aimed at earlier detection of negative features. Such inclusions may detract from one of the SADL's advantages, namely its brevity. It also is suggested that the long-term value of self-report methods will depend on development of rigorous and scientifically acceptable administration procedures, including appropriate times for application."
"11770672","Comparing loudness normalization (IHAFF) with speech intelligibility maximization (NAL-NL1) when implemented in a two-channel device.","OBJECTIVE: At least two rationales are available for fitting wide dynamic range compression hearing aids. The goal of one rationale is to normalize loudness, and the goal of the second rationale is to maximize speech intelligibility. Neither rationale has been validated against other fitting rationales for the range of input levels common to the hearing aid user in the real world. The goal of the study was to compare the two rationales when implemented in a 2-channel compression hearing aid.DESIGN: Loudness normalization and speech intelligibility maximization were implemented using the Independent Hearing Aid Fitting Forum (IHAFF) and the National Acoustic Laboratories' Nonlinear (NAL-NL1) prescriptive formulas. Twenty-four subjects (eight for each of three groups of mild flat, moderate/severe flat, and steeply sloping hearing loss) participated in the study. Each subject completed an initial laboratory test, field test, and final laboratory test. The laboratory test consisted of a paired-comparison judgment for each prescriptive formula using four stimuli under both quiet and noisy listening conditions and a sentence recognition test using Bamford-Kowal-Bench sentences. In the field test, subjects evaluated the two rationales in individually selected everyday listening conditions for 4 wk. A digital simulation of the fitting rationales implemented in two channels was used for laboratory testing and a digital 2-memory, 2-channel device was used for field testing. Subjects adjusted the overall gain of each response to their preferred listening level in both the laboratory and in the field.RESULTS: Data collected in the laboratory before and after the field test showed no indication of significant learning or acclimatization effects. For each stimulus presented in the paired-comparison test more subjects preferred NAL-NL1 than preferred IHAFF. For the sentence recognition test, subjects performed significantly better with NAL-NL1 than IHAFF in a low-frequency weighted background noise. Sixteen out of 22 subjects who completed the field test reported a preference for the NAL-NL1 response. The remaining six subjects preferred IHAFF. The paired-comparison test and field test revealed that while the achieved root-mean-square (rms) difference between fittings for an input level of 65 dB SPL was small, the preference for either rationale was small. As the rms difference between fittings increased, the score in favor of NAL-NL1 increased. The correlation between the differences in satisfaction score obtained in the field test and the rms differences between the responses fitted was statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: When the two fitting rationales prescribed substantially different responses for a 65 dB SPL input and these differences were achieved in the fitting, then the subjects preferred NAL-NL1. Even when the difference between fittings was small, the subjects preferred and performed better with NAL-NL1 when listening in a low-frequency weighted background noise."
"12918630","Demands on hearing aid features--special signal processing for elderly users?","Age-related effects on several parameters of hearing aid provision, comprising the importance of various hearing aid attributes, the main reason for dissatisfaction, and a measure for aided performance, were examined. When comparing two subgroups of younger and elderly hearing aid users, a significant difference occurred for the importance of the attribute 'handling', whereas all other features examined showed only differences in trends. The question posed for the main reason for dissatisfaction with the hearing aids revealed no significant contrasts. Problems with the instruments in several listening situations were investigated by means of the Gothenburg Profile. Items related to communication in groups showed significant differences between younger and older subjects, but only non-significant contrasts remained when the mean hearing losses of the two subgroups were properly matched. Based on the data presented, some age-related concerns should be taken into account in hearing-aid provision for elderly users, but special signal processing does not seem to be necessary."
"15064661","Is normal or less than normal overall loudness preferred by first-time hearing aid users?","OBJECTIVE: Most prescriptive methods for nonlinear, wide dynamic range compression (WDRC) hearing aids are based on the assumption that a hearing-impaired listener should perceive amplified sounds at the same overall loudness as would a normal-hearing listener without amplification. However, some previous research on linear amplification has indicated that subjects prefer less overall gain than prescribed by the most commonly used prescriptive method for linear hearing aids, NAL-R, a method that gives close to normal overall loudness for a mid-level input. The current study aims at comparing two prescriptive methods for WDRC hearing aids. The methods differ in the overall loudness they aim to give the hearing aid user. One method, called NormLoudn, is based on a generic method that prescribes gain so that the overall loudness is restored to normal. Another method, called LessLoudn, is based on a hearing aid specific prescription, and gives the hearing aid user less than normal overall loudness. Do first-time hearing aid users prefer the method that restores overall loudness to normal or the method that gives less than normal overall loudness?DESIGN: Twenty-one first-time hearing aid users with typical hearing losses for this group of clients participated in a crossover blinded field study where the two fitting methods were compared using a multi-programmable hearing aid, Danalogic 163D. Preference in the field was evaluated using interview, questionnaire, and diary. The field test was accompanied by laboratory tests, which included paired comparison judgments of preference and loudness and a speech recognition test. Loudness calculations were also used when interpreting the results, and a theoretical comparison with other prescriptive methods for WDRC hearing aids was made.RESULTS: After necessary adjustments, the measured gain for the two methods was similar in gain-frequency shape, but NormLoudn gave more overall gain than LessLoudn. Generally, NormLoudn fittings led to calculated overall loudness that was close to normal, whereas LessLoudn fittings, in median, led to 3-7 phon less than normal calculated overall loudness according to the loudness model used. During the interview performed after the field test, 19 out of the 21 subjects stated that they preferred LessLoudn. Also the questionnaire and the diary showed a clear preference for LessLoudn in all types of listening situations. Paired comparisons of preference in the laboratory supported the findings in the field. LessLoudn was preferred to NormLoudn in all tested situations, except for soft speech in very soft noise where there was no significant preference for either method. Speech recognition scores were similar for the two fittings. The difference in calculated loudness was clearly distinguishable to the subjects and seemed to govern their preferences.CONCLUSIONS: LessLoudn, which gave less than normal overall loudness according to the loudness model used, was preferred both in the field and in the laboratory tests. Speech recognition scores were similar for both methods. A comparison between the measured gain for NormLoudn and the gain prescribed by CAMEQ, NAL-NL1, and DSL[i/o], suggests that all three prescriptive procedures (DSL[i/o] in particular) would probably overestimate the required gain for subjects without hearing aid experience and with mild to moderate hearing loss. When providing these clients with hearing aids, it seems important to include a careful adjustment of the overall gain to avoid overamplification if the prescription used aims at restoring overall loudness to normal according to the loudness model used here."
"16377990","Hearing aid patients in private practice and public health (Veterans Affairs) clinics: are they different?","OBJECTIVE: In hearing aid research, it is commonplace to combine data across subjects whose hearing aids were provided in different service delivery models. There is reason to question whether these types of patients are always similar enough to justify this practice. To explore this matter, this investigation evaluated similarities and differences in self-report data obtained from hearing aid patients derived from public health (Veterans Affairs, VA) and private practice (PP) settings.DESIGN: The study was a multisite, cross-sectional survey in which 230 hearing aid patients from VA and PP audiology clinic settings provided self-report data on a collection of questionnaires both before and after the hearing aid fitting. Subjects were all older adults with mild to moderately severe hearing loss. About half of them had previous experience wearing hearing aids. All subjects were fitted with wide-dynamic-range-compression instruments and received similar treatment protocols.RESULTS: Numerous statistically significant differences were observed between the VA and PP subject groups. Before the fitting, VA patients reported higher expectations from the hearing aids and more severe unaided problems compared with PP patients with similar audiograms. Three wks after the fitting, VA patients reported more satisfaction with their hearing aids. On some measures VA patients reported more benefit, but different measures of benefit did not give completely consistent results. Both groups reported using the hearing aids an average of approximately 8 hrs per day. VA patients reported age-normal physical and mental health, but PP patients tended to report better than typical health for their age group.CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that hearing aid patients seen in the VA public health hearing services are systematically different in self-report domains from those seen in private practice services. It is therefore risky to casually combine data from these two types of subjects or to generalize research results from one group to the other. Further, compared with PP patients, VA patients consistently reported more favorable hearing aid fitting outcomes. Additional study is indicated to explore the determinants of this result and its generalizability to other public health service delivery systems such as those in other countries. Moreover, efforts should be made to assess the potential for transferring positive elements from the VA system to the PP service delivery system, if possible."
"16787899","The effects of high-frequency amplification on the objective and subjective performance of hearing instrument users with varying degrees of high-frequency hearing loss.","PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to determine if amplifying beyond 2 kHz affected the objective and subjective performance of hearing instrument users with varying degrees of mild-to-severe high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss.METHOD: Twenty participants were fitted binaurally with digital completely-in-the-canal devices with 4-channel wide dynamic range compression (Starkey Axent). Each participant used the hearing instruments for two 6-week trial periods. Each hearing instrument was programmed to maximize high-frequency audibility during 1 trial period and minimize high-frequency audibility during the other trial period. Objective evaluations were conducted in quiet using the Connected Speech Test (CST) and in noise using the CST and the Hearing in Noise Test. Subjective performance was evaluated by administering the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit and a questionnaire.RESULTS: Results indicated that high-frequency amplification significantly improved objective performance in noise and subjective preference in quiet for listeners with varying degrees of mild-to-severe high-frequency hearing loss. Results also suggested that high-frequency amplification may affect subjective preference in noise and overall for listeners with varying degrees of mild-to-severe high-frequency hearing loss when feedback is eliminated.CONCLUSION: Based on these significant benefits, dispensers should be aware that high-frequency amplification should, at least initially, be provided to the affected high-frequency regions when mild-to-severe hearing loss is present."
"16684705","Measuring outcomes of a communication program for older people with hearing impairment using the International Outcome Inventory.","The main objective of this study was to describe the outcomes of a communication education program for older people with hearing impairment using the International Outcome Inventory--Alternative Interventions (IOI-AI) and the version for significant others (IOI-AI-SO). Ninety-six people aged 58 to 94 years participated in an interactive group education program for two hours per week for five weeks. The IOI-AI was administered at one to two weeks after the last educational session and 29 significant others also completed the IOI-AI-SO at this time. Overall, positive results were obtained using both questionnaires, and satisfaction with the program was particularly high. Findings also compared favourably to reports of outcomes for other audiological interventions (i.e., another communication training program and hearing aid fitting). Principal components analysis of the IOI-AI revealed a somewhat different factor structure than the original IOI-HA. The two versions of the IOI applied in this study are recommended as simple and effective measures of the outcomes of alternative interventions."
"18561116","Treatment of tinnitus with a customized acoustic neural stimulus: a controlled clinical study.","In patients with tinnitus, achieving consistently positive treatment results is a challenge. We conducted a controlled clinical study of a new treatment approach (Neuromonics Tinnitus Treatment) that involves the use of a customized neural stimulus. This stimulus is delivered to the patient in the form of a pleasant acoustic sensation that is spectrally modified according to each patient's individual audiometric profile. This treatment approach is provided as part of a structured rehabilitation program. In our study, patients who received the customized stimulus (Neuromonics group) reported significantly greater and more consistent alleviation of tinnitus symptoms than did patients who participated in a counseling and support program with and without delivery of a broadband noise stimulus (Noise+Counseling group and Counseling-Only group, respectively). After 6 months of treatment, 86% of the Neuromonics patients met the minimum criterion for clinical success, defined as an alleviation of tinnitus disturbance of at least 40% (as determined by the Tinnitus Reaction Questionnaire score). By contrast, only 47 and 23% of the Noise+Counseling and Counseling-Only groups, respectively, reported a successful result according to this criterion. Mean improvements in tinnitus disturbance scores in the Neuromonics, Noise+Counseling, and Counseling-Only groups were 66, 22, and 15%, respectively. The differences between the Neuromonics group and the control groups were statistically significant. Significant differences were observed in other clinical outcomes. Patient reports of user acceptability were more consistently positive in the Neuromonics group."
"18415113","A survey of satisfaction and use among patients fitted with a BAHA.","We compared the indices of satisfaction and use among patients wearing an osseo-integrated prosthesis BAHA (bone anchored hearing aid) according to the indications: conductive or mixed hearing loss (CHL) and patients with single side deafness (SSD). The study was carried out among patients wearing a BAHA fitted in one of three French departments between November 2001 and November 2005. Each patient received a postal questionnaire relating to the ease of use and the daily utilization period of the prosthesis, as well as a satisfaction rating (from 1 to 10) evaluating improvement in quality of life, overall satisfaction, improvement in sound localization and satisfaction from the aesthetic point of view. In total, 170 out of 231 patients responded to the questionnaire (response rate of 73.5%). The average age at the time of fitting of the BAHA was 56 years (18-79 years). The SSD group was composed of 118 patients (69.4%): 92 following surgery for vestibular schwannoma, 2 following surgery for meningioma and 24 with &quot;other&quot; causes (e.g. idiopathic sudden deafness, sensori neural hearing loss complicating surgery of the middle ear). The CHL group was composed of 52 patients (30.5%): 44 patients with a chronic otitis and 8 with a malformation of the middle ear. The average duration of use of the prosthesis was 22 months (3-72 months). The average utilization period was higher than 8 h per day in 48.5% of cases. There was a significant difference between the two groups concerning the quality of life (p &lt; 0.0001), general satisfaction (p &lt; 0.0001) and sound localization (p &lt; 0.01). There was no significant difference concerning aesthetics. Among the patients of the CHL group, the levels of satisfaction and quality of life are comparable with recent data in the literature with scores of good or very good. The BAHA thus remains one of the methods of choice for hearing rehabilitation in this group of patients. Among the patients of the SSD group, the levels of satisfaction and quality of life are significantly poorer than in the CHL group, but remain generally good with the exception of sound localization. The treatment of SSD patients with a BAHA is interesting. A study comparing the BAHA with the WIFI CROS system is justified in order to ascertain the respective advantages of these two treatment options."
"19380509","Do experienced hearing aid users know how to use their hearing AIDS correctly?","PURPOSE: To assess experienced hearing aid users' ability to use their hearing aids correctly.METHOD: In this study, we developed the Practical Hearing Aid Skills Test (PHAST) to objectively test a hearing aid user's ability to manipulate his or her hearing aids. The PHAST requires hearing aid users to perform 8 hearing aid care and use tasks that are basic skills typically taught to new hearing aid users at the time of their hearing aid fitting. The PHAST was administered to a group of 50 experienced hearing aid users. In addition, participants were administered questionnaires about hearing aid satisfaction (i.e., Satisfaction With Amplification in Daily Life; R. M. Cox &amp; G. C. Alexander, 1999), benefit (i.e., Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit; R. M. Cox &amp; G. C. Alexander, 1995), and use.RESULTS: Participants' performance on the PHAST ranged from 48% to 100%, and the scores were normally distributed around the mean (78.56%). No significant relationship was observed between the PHAST and any of the other tests administered in this study. The only variable significantly associated with participants' performance on the PHAST was age.CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study suggest that experienced hearing aid users range from having an excellent understanding of how to use their hearing aids to a poor understanding. The variability in performance among experienced hearing aid users highlights the importance of directly assessing a client's ability to use his or her hearing aids."
"20738337","The bone-anchored hearing aid in the rehabilitation of single-sided deafness: experience with 58 patients.","OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of the bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) in the rehabilitation of single-sided deafness (SSD).STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case-control series review.SETTING: Tertiary referral unit.PATIENTS: Fifty-eight consecutive patients that had a bone-anchored hearing aid for single-sided deafness completed outcome questionnaires, building upon earlier audiological assessment of 19 patients. Single-sided deafness controls (n = 49) were mainly acoustic neuroma patients.MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: speech discrimination testing in directional noise, speech and spatial qualities of hearing questionnaire and the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI).RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 28.4 months. Five (13%) of the bone-anchored hearing aid patients were non-users because of lack of benefit. The audiometric testing confirmed that when noise was on the bone-anchored hearing aid side speech perception was reduced but benefited when noise was on the side of the hearing ear. There was no difference between the Speech and Spatial Qualities of Hearing Scores in bone-anchored hearing aid users and controls. In particular there was no difference in the spatial subscores. In the bone-anchored hearing aid users the median Glasgow Benefit Inventory score was 11. If the non-users are included then 13 (22%) patients had no or detrimental (negative) Benefit scores. No or negative benefit scores were more frequent in those deaf for &lt;10 years. In open-field questions, patients felt the bone-anchored hearing aid was most useful in small groups or in 'one-to-one' conversation.CONCLUSIONS: Bone-anchored hearing aid rehabilitation for single-sided deafness is less successful than for other indications, reflected here by relatively low median Glasgow Benefit Inventory scores. There was also no significant difference between controls and bone-anchored hearing aid users in the Speech and Spatial Qualities of Hearing Questionnaire. Patients with a longer duration of deafness report greater subjective benefit than those more recently deafened, perhaps due to differing expectations."
"20418795","Otologics middle ear transducer with contralateral conventional hearing aid in severe sensorineural hearing loss: evolution during the first 24 months.","OBJECTIVES: To report the audiometric outcomes of patients with severe sensorineural hearing loss and who have been fitted with a Middle Ear Transducer (MET) on one side and fitted with an optimized conventional hearing aid on the other side.STUDY DESIGN: The MET fitting results were measured and compared with contralateral conventional hearing aids in a prospective study.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: Seven patients (ages, 53-77 yr) with severe sensorineural hearing loss (pure-tone average, 71-90 dB HL) were implanted between December 2004 and March 2006.METHOD: Audiometric testing was performed the day of activation (2 mo postoperative) and after 8 days and 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months. For each follow-up, MET and conventional hearing aid were optimized according to the patient's hearing loss.RESULTS: Mean functional gains were 29 dB for conventional hearing aid and 35 dB the first day of the study with the MET and 39 dB after 6 months.DISCUSSION: The performance of the MET and the absence of occlusion of the external auditory canal could explain the improved benefit. For maximum gain, the MET requires a regular follow-up during the first 6 months.CONCLUSION: MET seems to be a suitable and successful treatment option resulting in significant improvement in speech comprehension, especially after 6 months, in patients with severe sensorineural hearing loss. During the 24-month follow-up of this study, the MET has been a safe and effective treatment for severe hearing loss."
"21799455","Long-term safety and benefit of a new intraoral device for single-sided deafness.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the long-term safety and benefit of a new intraoral bone conduction device (SoundBite Hearing System by Sonitus Medical) for single-sided deafness (SSD).STUDY DESIGN: A multi-center, controlled, nonrandomized, prospective unblinded study of SSD patients wearing the device over a 6-month period.SETTINGS: Ambulatory care centers typical of those where SSD patients are diagnosed and treated.PATIENTS: Adults (N = 22) with acquired, permanent SSD and no current use of any other SSD device.INTERVENTION: Continual daily wear of the new device for 6 months.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comprehensive medical, audiologic, and dental measures; aided thresholds; Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit scores, and an SSD questionnaire.RESULTS: There were no related adverse events or changes in the medical or audiologic findings at the end of the trial compared with the beginning. There were no significant changes in the mean aided thresholds (p &gt; 0.01) or the mean dental measures (p &gt; 0.05) at 3 or 6 months compared with pretrial measures. The mean Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit benefit scores showed improvement (p &lt; 0.01) for the Background Noise, Reverberation, and Ease of Communication subscales and the Global scale at 3 and 6 months. The results of the SSD questionnaire indicated that the vast majority (&gt;90%) of the subjects reported satisfaction and improvement in a variety of areas after wearing the device long term.CONCLUSION: The SoundBite system is safe and continues to provide substantial benefit for SSD patients with continual daily use over a 6-month period."
"21271802","Cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Chinese abbreviated profile of hearing aid benefit.","OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate the cross-cultural validity and reliability of the Chinese version of the Abbreviated Profile of the Hearing Aid Benefit questionnaire (APHAB-CH).DESIGN: A convenience sampling method was used to identify and recruit subjects. The subjects completed a history form seeking demographic data, the APHAB-CH, and a questionnaire seeking a subjective rating of hearing aid performance and overall satisfaction with their hearing aid.STUDY SAMPLE: The subjects were 134 experienced hearing aid users.RESULTS: The APHAB-CH had a good internal consistency reliability estimate (a = 0.85) comparable to that of the original version. Significant correlation was observed between the APHAB-CH scores and other subjective ratings for hearing aid performance and the overall satisfaction measure. A high test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.84) was observed. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the APHAB-CH had a two-factor structure comprising &quot;hearing disability&quot; and &quot;averviseness.&quot; Normative data in terms of equal-percentile profiles were dervied for the APHAB-CH.CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the APHAB-CH is a reliable and valid measure of the outcomes of hearing aid fitting."
"23107440","The use of research questionnaires with hearing impaired adults: online vs. paper-and-pencil administration.","BACKGROUND: When evaluating hearing rehabilitation, it is reasonable to use self-report questionnaires as outcome measure. Questionnaires used in audiological research are developed and validated for the paper-and-pencil format. As computer and Internet use is increasing, standardized questionnaires used in the audiological context should be evaluated to determine the viability of the online administration format.The aim of this study was to compare administration of questionnaires online versus paper- and pencil of four standardised questionnaires used in hearing research and clinic. We included the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE), the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA), Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life (SADL), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).METHODS: A cross-over design was used by randomly letting the participants complete the questionnaires either online or on paper. After 3 weeks the participants filled out the same questionnaires again but in the other format. A total of 65 hearing-aid users were recruited from a hearing clinic to participate on a voluntary basis and of these 53 completed both versions of the questionnaires.RESULTS: A significant main effect of format was found on the HHIE (p &lt; 0.001), with participants reporting higher scores on the online format than in the paper format. There was no interaction effect. For the other questionnaires were no significant main or interaction effects of format. Significant correlations between the two ways of presenting the measures was found for all questionnaires (p&lt;0.05). The results from reliability tests showed Cronbachs a's above .70 for all four questionnaires and differences in Cronbachs a between administration formats were negligible.CONCLUSIONS: For three of the four included questionnaires the participants' scores remained consistent across administrations and formats. For the fourth included questionnaire (HHIE) a significant difference of format with a small effect size was found. The relevance of the difference in scores between the formats depends on which context the questionnaire is used in. On balance, it is recommended that the administration format remain stable across assessment points."
"22710661","Factors associated with third-party disability in spouses of older people with hearing impairment.","OBJECTIVES: This study had two aims: (1) to describe the extent of third-party disability in a sample of spouses of older people with hearing impairment, and (2) to investigate factors associated with third-party hearing disability. Third-party disability is defined as the disability and functioning of family members as a result of the health condition of their significant other.DESIGN: One hundred older spouses who had partners with hearing impairment participated. All assessments were self-reported, and included a set of measures (the 36-item Significant Other Scale for Hearing Disability, SOS-HEAR; the Relationship Assessment Scale; and the Significant Other Assessment of Communication) administered to the target population of normally hearing older spouses, and those administered to the hearing impaired partners of the spouses in the study (the Self Assessment of Communication). To address the first aim, descriptive statistics were used to describe the extent of third-party hearing disability in the spouses. To address the second aim, binary logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with third-party hearing disability. Factors investigated were focused on the spouse (e.g., spouse perception of relationship satisfaction) and on the partners with hearing impairment (e.g., partners' level of hearing impairment).RESULTS: Most spouses (98%) reported some degree of third-party hearing disability on at least one item of the SOS-HEAR, with the majority reporting a mild disability. Three risk factors were found to be significantly associated with severe or complete third-party disability: lower relationship satisfaction as reported by the spouse (Relationship Assessment Scale), spousal age difference, and spouse perception of their partner's hearing disability (Significant Other Assessment of Communication). Partners' level of hearing impairment, self-reported hearing disability (Self Assessment of Communication), use of hearing aids, and spouse satisfaction that their hearing-impaired partner had done all they could to help with hearing were not associated with third-party disability.CONCLUSIONS: This research study shows that spouses of older people with hearing impairment experience third-party disability as a result of their partners' hearing impairment and that the SOS-HEAR could be used to identify the nature of the disability. The three factors found to be associated with third-party disability could identify spouses at risk of third-party disability related to hearing impairment and form the basis of an intervention."
"22537034","Hearing-aid outcomes in Chinese adults: clinical application and psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life questionnaire.","OBJECTIVE: To adapt the Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life questionnaire into Chinese (the SADL-CH questionnaire) and investigate hearing-aid satisfaction in a group of adult Hong Kong Chinese fitted with free hearing aids.DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.STUDY SAMPLE: One hundred and twenty-five experienced hearing-aid users.METHODS: The subjects completed a history form seeking demographic data and a questionnaire combining the SADL-CH instrument with questions seeking subjects' subjective ratings of satisfaction with some hearing-aid features and overall satisfaction with their hearing aid.RESULTS: The SADL-CH questionnaire had a good internal consistency reliability estimate (a =<U+2009>0.79) comparable to that of the original version. SADL-CH scores were observed to have significant correlations with other satisfaction ratings on some hearing-aid features and the overall satisfaction measure. A high degree of test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient =<U+2009>0.79) was observed. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the SADL-CH questionnaire had a four-factor structure. Interim norms were derived for the SADL-CH questionnaire. The level of hearing-aid satisfaction in Chinese adults was generally lower than that reported in studies conducted among Western populations.CONCLUSION: The SADL-CH questionnaire is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring hearing-aid satisfaction."
"24260863","[Analysis of reliability of the Chinese version of satisfaction with amplification in daily life].","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the reliability of the Chinese version of Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life (SADL).METHOD: The cross-cultural adaption measures were used to translate the SADL into Chinese version. Thirty hearing aid users no younger than 18 years old were included. Test-retest analysis was administrated to the patients without significant changes in health and social status with an interval of two weeks between test and retest.RESULT: Test-retest reliability of the SADL was proved to be satisfactory. All subscales and global score had coefficients that exceeded 0.70 (P &lt; 0.01). Except for &quot;personal image&quot;, the score of other subscales and global score in this study are higher than the U. S. interim norms described by Cox and Alexander (1999) (P &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSION: This study completed the translation and test-retest analysis of Chinese version of SADL. We need further discussion about validation of Chinese version of SADL in order to meet basic psychometric criteria of a standard outcome measurement."
"24227899","Evaluation of hearing aid benefit through a new questionnaire: CISQ (Complete Intelligibility Spatiality Quality).","The purpose of this work was to create a rapid and simple instrument to evaluate the benefits of a hearing aid, that was at the same time reliable and complete. We created a new questionnaire by integration of other well consolidated psychometric tests to better investigate all the aspects that contribute in determining the hearing aid benefit, also considering as important some areas that are not usually considered (spatiality and quality of sound). We started from a 36-item questionnaire divided in six subscales (spatiality and quality of signal, intelligibility in silence, background noise intelligibility, averseness and reverberation), and submitted it to patients before hearing aid application and at 2-3 months after that. A statistically significant difference between results before and after hearing aid application was found. To obtain the final 30-item questionnaire, we analyzed the reliability of each subscale using Cronbach's alpha coefficient, and eliminated the item whose internal consistency was lower for every subscale. For these reasons, the CISQ questionnaire is a rapid and simple test that can be considered a reliable and complete instrument to evaluate the benefits of a hearing aid. Lo scopo di questo lavoro è stato quello di creare un questionario per valutare il beneficio protesico che fosse rapido e di facile utilizzazione, ma allo stesso tempo completo e attendibile. Partendo da altri test psicometrici ormai ben consolidati, abbiamo creato un nuovo questionario in grado di indagare i diversi aspetti che concorrono nel determinare il beneficio protesico del paziente, ovvero il grado di soddisfazione soggettiva che, insieme al guadagno protesico, porta alla definizione della cosiddetta resa protesica. Partendo dai test ad oggi maggiormente utilizzati abbiamo creato un primo questionario costituito da 36 domande, divise per sei sottoscale riguardanti i diversi ambiti che ci interessava indagare: comprensione in ambienti riverberanti, intelligibilità, intelligibilità nel rumore, percezione dei rumori forti, qualità del segnale e spazialità. Abbiamo poi somministrato il questionario a 40 pazienti ipoacusici prima della protesizzazione e tre mesi dopo l'applicazione della stessa, al termine cioè dell'adattamento protesico. Confrontando i due questionari mediante un'analisi statistica è stato possibile evidenziare una differenza statisticamente significativa tra le risposte date prima e dopo la protesizzazione. Affinché il questionario fosse attendibile abbiamo poi calcolato l'Alpha di Cronbach, coefficiente che serve a valutare la coerenza interna di raggruppamenti di items. Abbiamo quindi eliminato per ogni sottoscala la domanda dotata della minore coerenza interna, ottenendo così il questionario definitivo costituito da 30 domande. Il numero relativamente ridotto di items consente la rapida esecuzione del test rendendolo pertanto facilmente fruibile; allo stesso tempo però le sei sottoscale assicurano la completezza dell'indagine, comprendendo anche ambiti solitamente meno indagati (spazialità e qualità del suono). L'analisi statistica e il calcolo dell'Alpha di Cronbach assicurano altresì che le domande siano chiare, che portino a dare risposte nettamente differenti in una condizione di ipoacusia rispetto ad una di buona udibilità, e completamente attendibili. Per tutte queste caratteristiche il questionario CISQ può essere considerato un completo strumento di valutazione del beneficio protesico."
"23744085","[User benefit of modern hearing aids. A comparative study].","BACKGROUND: In the face of the rapid development of hearing aid system technology it is helpful to regularly study the user benefit of the current generation.TEST PERSONS AND METHODS: To contribute to the question on how the user benefit of current hearing aids compares with the benefit of the previous generation of hearing aids, a multicentre study was carried out in cooperation with 79 hearing aid acoustics companies in Germany. The user benefit of modern hearing aids in everyday life was assessed by asking end users to participate in a survey by completing a questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 20 items, 10 of which were taken from validated international inventories (SSQ: Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing scale, IOI-HA: International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids) and the other 10 were formulated particularly for this purpose.RESULTS: A total of 664 usable questionnaires were returned whereby 421 responders were first time users and 243 responders were previous hearing aid users. The results of the present study showed that modern hearing aid system technology provides significant extra benefits at the 5 % level relative to the previous generation of hearing aids for all variables tested in this study.CONCLUSIONS: Even though the amount of gain in terms of user benefit may be overestimated due to well-known placebo effects, an obvious net effect was evident. Correlations between the level of hearing aid benefit and possible influencing factors, such as age, gender, subjects own hearing aid, duration of use or hearing loss, could not be identified."
"26035144","Social Support Predicts Hearing Aid Satisfaction.","OBJECTIVES: The goals of the current research were to determine: (1) whether there is a relationship between perceived social support and hearing aid satisfaction, and (2) how well perceived social support predicts hearing aid satisfaction relative to other correlates previously identified in the literature.DESIGN: In study 1, 173 adult ((Equation is included in full-text article.)age = 68.9 years; SD = 13.4) users of hearing aids completed a survey assessing attitudes toward health, hearing, and hearing aids, as well as a questionnaire assessing Big-Five personality factors (Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) either using paper and pencil or the Internet. In a follow-up study designed to replicate and extend the results from study 1, 161 adult ((Equation is included in full-text article.)age = 32.8 years; SD = 13.3) users of hearing aids completed a similar survey on the Internet. In study 2, participants also completed a measure of hearing aid benefit and reported the style of their hearing aid.RESULTS: In studies 1 and 2, perceived social support was significantly correlated with hearing aid satisfaction (respectively, r = 0.34, r = 0.51, ps &lt; 0.001). The results of a regression analysis revealed that in study 1, 22% of the variance in hearing aid satisfaction scores was predicted by perceived social support, satisfaction with one's hearing health care provider, duration of daily hearing aid use, and openness. In study 2, 43% of the variance in hearing aid satisfaction was predicted by perceived social support, hearing aid benefit, neuroticism, and hearing aid style. Overall, perceived social support was the best predictor of hearing aid satisfaction in both studies. After controlling for response style (i.e., acquiescence or the tendency to respond positively), the correlation between perceived social support and hearing aid satisfaction remained the same in study 1 (r = 0.34, p &lt; 0.001) and was lower in study 2 (r = 0.39, p &lt; 0.001), although the change in correlation was not significant.CONCLUSIONS: The results from study 1 provide evidence to suggest that perceived social support is a significant predictor of satisfaction with hearing aids, a finding that was replicated in a different sample of participants investigated in study 2. A significant relationship between perceived social support and hearing aid satisfaction was observed in both studies, even though the composition of the two samples differed in terms of age, relationship status, income, proportion of individuals with unilateral versus bilateral hearing impairment, and lifetime experience with hearing aids. The results from both studies 1 and 2 provide no support for the claim that participant response style accounts for the relationship between hearing aid satisfaction and perceived social support."
"25811932","Exploring the Effects of the Narrative Embodied in the Hearing Aid Fitting Process on Treatment Outcomes.","OBJECTIVES: There is strong evidence from other fields of health, and growing evidence in audiology, that characteristics of the process of intervention as perceived by the client (embodied narratives) can have significant effects on treatment outcomes, independent of the technical properties of the intervention itself. This phenomenon deserves examination because studies of technical interventions that fail to take account of it may reach erroneous conclusions and because clinical practice can put such effects to therapeutic use. The aim of this study was to test the idea that embodied narratives might affect outcomes in hearing aid fitting. This was achieved by carrying out experiments in which technical (acoustic) differences between alternative hearing aid fittings were absent, while providing test subjects with a strong contrast between the processes apparently applied to derive the fittings being compared. Thus, any effects of contrasting narratives could be observed, free of acoustical confounds. The hypothesis was that narrative effects would be observed.DESIGN: A balanced crossover design was used, in which subjects received and evaluated two bilateral hearing aid fittings in succession. Subjects were deceived as to the true identical content of the hearing aid fittings being compared, but encouraged to believe that one fitting process was &quot;interactive&quot; and the other was &quot;diagnostic&quot; in character. Two almost identical experiments were undertaken: one with 24 experienced adult hearing aid users and another with 16 adult first-time users. Each hearing aid fitting was worn at home for 2 weeks, after which self-report outcome measures (Hearing Aid Performance Questionnaire, Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly, and International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids) were administered. After the second test period, a short preference questionnaire was also completed.RESULTS: Twenty of the 24 experienced users showed a clear preference for one or the other fitting, and their self-report scores reflected these preferences. Effect sizes were comparable with those typically observed for true acoustical contrasts. No order effect was seen in this group. In contrast, 13 of the 16 first-time users preferred the second fitting. Trends in the self-report measures were similar for this group but weaker than for the experienced users. In both groups, the reasons given for subjects' preference were predominantly related to sound, despite there being no acoustical differences.CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the narrative embodied in a given fitting process can have a substantial effect on the perceived benefit of the treatment, independent of any acoustical differences, at least for experienced users. For first-time users, acclimatization seems to overshadow the purely narrative effect of any fitting process. In the future, research study designs should include steps to avoid narrative effects when technical parameters of hearing aids are the intended object of study. In clinical practice, the narrative is part of the therapeutic context, and one may design it for maximum beneficial effect."
"28590898","Tinnitus Management: Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Extended-Wear Hearing Aids, Conventional Hearing Aids, and Combination Instruments.","BACKGROUND: Whereas hearing aids have long been considered effective for providing relief from tinnitus, controlled clinical studies evaluating this premise have been very limited.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to systematically determine the relative efficacy of conventional receiver-in-the-canal hearing aids (HA), the same hearing aids with a sound generator (HA+SG), and extended-wear, deep fit hearing aids (EWHA), to provide relief from tinnitus through a randomized controlled trial. Each of these ear-level devices was a product of Phonak, LLC.RESEARCH DESIGN: Participants were randomized to HA, HA+SG, or EWHA and wore bilaterally fit devices for about 4 months. Fittings, adjustments, and follow-up appointments were conducted to comply with company guidelines and to ensure that all participants attended appointments on the same schedule. At 4-5 months, participants returned to complete final outcome measures, which concluded their study participation.STUDY SAMPLE: Participants were 55 individuals (mean age: 63.1 years) with mild to moderately-severe hearing loss who: (a) did not currently use hearing aids; (b) reported tinnitus that was sufficiently bothersome to warrant intervention; and (c) were suitable candidates for each of the study devices.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The primary outcome measure was the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI). Secondary outcome measures included hearing-specific questionnaires and the Quick Speech in Noise test (QuickSIN). The goal of the analysis was to evaluate efficacy of the EWHA and HA+SG devices versus the HA standard device.RESULTS: There were 18 participants in each of the HA and EWHA groups and 19 in the HA+SG group. Gender, age, and baseline TFI severity were balanced across treatment groups. Nearly all participants had a reduction in tinnitus symptoms during the study. The average TFI change (improvement) from baseline was 21 points in the HA group, 31 points in the EWHA group, and 33 points in the HA+SG group. A &quot;clinically significant&quot; improvement in reaction to tinnitus (at least 13-point reduction in TFI score) was seen by 67% of HA, 82% of EWHA, and 79% of HA+SG participants. There were no statistically significant differences in the extent to which the devices reduced TFI scores. Likewise, the hearing-specific questionnaires and QuickSIN showed improvements following use of the hearing aids but these improvements did not differ across device groups.CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to conclude that any of these devices offers greater relief from tinnitus than any other one tested. However, all devices appear to offer some improvement in the functional effects of tinnitus."
"28534117","A multicenter study on objective and subjective benefits with a transcutaneous bone-anchored hearing aid device: first Nordic results.","Examination of objective as well as subjective outcomes with a new transcutaneous bone-anchored hearing aid device. The study was designed as a prospective multicenter consecutive case-series study involving tertiary referral centers at two Danish University Hospitals. A total of 23 patients were implanted. Three were lost to follow-up. Patients had single-sided deafness, conductive or mixed hearing loss.INTERVENTION: Rehabilitative. Aided and unaided sound field hearing was evaluated objectively using (1) pure warble tone thresholds, (2) pure-tone average (PTA4), (3) speech discrimination score (SDS) in quiet, and (4) speech reception threshold 50% at 70 dB SPL noise level (SRT50%). Subjective benefit was evaluated by three validated questionnaires: (1) the IOI-HA, (2) the SSQ-12, and (3) a questionnaire evaluating both the frequency and the duration of hearing aid usage. The mean aided PTA4 was lowered by 14.7 dB. SDS was increased by 37.5% at 50 dB SPL, SRT50% in noise improved 1.4 dB. Aided thresholds improved insignificantly at frequencies above 2 kHz. 52.9% of the patients used their device every day, and 76.5% used the device at least 5 days a week. Mean IOI-HA score was 3.4, corresponding to a good benefit. In SSQ-12, &quot;quality of hearing&quot; scored especially high. Patients with a conductive and/or mixed hearing loss benefitted the most. This device demonstrates a significant subjective hearing benefit 8 month post surgery. In patients with conductive and/or mixed hearing losses, patient satisfaction and frequency of use were high. Objective gain measures showed less promising results especially in patients with single-sided deafness (SSD) compared to other bone conduction devices."
