"10990015","A comparison of wind noise in four hearing instruments.","Wind noise was measured in four behind-the-ear hearing instruments with different microphone openings. A silent airflow of 7 m/s was directed toward the ear of a Kemar head and the resulting wind noise was measured. The amplification was set to an insertion gain of 35 dB at 1.6 kHz. The wind noise amplitude at the position of the drum ranged from 84 to 97 dB(A). The hearing instrument with a partially covered microphone entrance proved best, whereas one with an open microphone entrance had the poorest performance. A reduction in wind noise of 6-17 dB could be achieved in all hearing instruments by using a simple windscreen made of Styrofoam. The windscreen affected the frequency response by less than 2 dB. By subtracting the insertion gain from the wind noise, an equivalent wind noise could be presented as a function of frequency. A considerable difference was found between the wind noise sensitivity in different hearing instruments. All could be improved by a windscreen without adversely affecting the frequency response."
"10810675","[Clinical comparison of a digital with an analog hearing aid].","The benefit of innovative hearing aid technology can be evaluated in clinical trials. The present study describes the comparison of a new digital hearing aid with an analogue device serving as a reference. The tests were carried out with 15 experienced hearing aid wearers. To prevent the influence of different fitting algorithms such as prescriptive or loudness-based the digital devices were not renewed fitted but their level- and frequency-depending gain was adjusted to that of the reference. Different tests concerning loudness perception (category loudness scaling) speech discrimination in noise (the Göttingen sentence test) and self-assessment of the benefit by questionnaires were performed. All tests yielded slightly better results for the digital hearing aid. The speech audiometric evaluation showed somewhat better discrimination for the test-device. The questionnaires yielded a marked preference for the digital device. Because the study was not blinded influences due to the knowledge of the subjects of testing a new technology generally can occur. On the other hand, the question arises whether present audiometric tests sufficiently consider signal processing of modern hearing systems. Furthermore, one has to take into account that only a few of the features of digital technology such as noise-reduction and feedback-cancellation were considered in this study to allow for a sensible comparison. Because of the large number of possibilities offered by digital technology additional benefit by the hearing aid can be expected."
"11501891","Effects of providing and withholding postfitting fine-tuning adjustments on outcome measures in novice hearing aid users: a pilot study.","This pilot study was designed to examine the effects of either providing or withholding subject-driven, postfitting electroacoustic changes (fine tuning) on hearing aid performance as measured by tests of speech recognition in noise, sound quality, and benefit. A group of adult first-time hearing aid users with moderate, high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss was studied over a 5-month postfitting period. Half of the group served as a control group; half constituted the treatment group. Treatment consisted of making as many postfitting electroacoustic manipulations as the participants' complaints/observations required. These adjustments were withheld from the control group individuals. Group performance differences were assessed using the COSI, two versions of the APHAB, a Satisfaction scale, a Sound Quality tool, and the SIN test. Analysis revealed no statistically significant differences in the control and treatment groups' performances or perceived benefit at any of the five postfitting test sessions. These data suggested that there was no measurable advantage to be derived from making postfitting frequency-gain adjustments of 10 dB or less to hearing aids with wide dynamic range compression fitted in the manner described in this article. Definitive studies of the effects of postfitting electroacoustic fine tuning must be undertaken."
"11324843","Using conjoint analysis to examine the importance of hearing aid attributes.","OBJECTIVE: To introduce conjoint analysis (CA) as a method to explain choice decisions of hearing aid users and to measure the contributions of different hearing aid attributes involved.DESIGN: The study was conducted using CA, a method that is well established in marketing, but has not been used for hearing aid research. CA examines the contributions (importance) various attributes make to overall preference judgements. It is based on the premises that objects (i.e., hearing aids) can be described as different combinations of several attributes. The relative importance of the attributes is estimated from integral judgements of hypothetical hearing aids. The advantages of CA are a more realistic presentation of complete products instead of isolated attributes and the consideration of trade-offs between the features. The following attributes selected from 12 features in a prestudy were included in the application: speech perception in quiet, speech perception in noise, handling, sound quality, localization, and feedback. 93 randomly chosen experienced hearing aid wearers participated in the survey.RESULTS: It was found that the attributes concerning speech perception were by far most important. Speech discrimination in quiet and in noise were almost equally significant and contributed with 56% to the preference decisions of the subjects. The remaining attributes showed values in the range of 10% to 12%. When comparing various subgroups dependent on age, sex, hearing loss, satisfaction, etc., significant differences concerning the preferences were found. Elder and female subjects attached greater importance of the attribute &quot;handling&quot; whereas younger patients judged &quot;speech in noise&quot; more important. In general, subjects with greater hearing loss considered speech intelligibility in quiet to be more important than in noisy surroundings. Moreover, sound quality seems to be a significant indicator for satisfaction with the hearing aid.CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes CA as a survey technique to examine individual preferences for hearing aids. Several assumptions about the importance of hearing aid features for different groups of users could be confirmed quantitatively. Segmentation showed valid results depending on socio-demographic and user-specific parameters. The method used and the results are of interest for audiologists as well as the hearing aid industry. They provide valuable tools for future hearing aid design and should be considered in the development of self-assessment inventories."
"11192875","Early clinical results: SOUNDTEC implantable hearing device phase II study.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of a new semi-implantable electromagnetic hearing device, the SOUNDTEC Direct Drive Hearing System (DDHS), and to compare its performance with that of subjects' previously worn, optimally fit hearing aids. Preliminary results for the first 10 subjects are presented.STUDY DESIGN: The protocol specified in the Investigational Device Exemption is used in this ongoing FDA phase II 100-subject multicenter clinical trial.METHODS: For baseline, each subject is tested wearing his or her own optimally fit hearing aid in the ear to be implanted. Six-month postoperative outcome measures using the SOUNDTEC DDHS are compared with the baseline. Multiple objective and subjective outcomes (as listed under Results) were measured.RESULTS: When compared with the subjects' optimally fit hearing aids, the SOUNDTEC DDHS provided an average improvement of 52% in functional gain (250-6000 Hz), 22% in aided thresholds, 3.8% for speech discrimination in quiet, 17% for speech in noise, 13.1% in articulation index scores, 28% in aided benefit, 27.3% in sound quality of speech, and a 16.7% increase in overall subject satisfaction. In addition, with the SOUNDTEC DDHS, subjects reported absence of acoustic feedback, little or no occlusive effects, and more natural sound perception.CONCLUSION: Analysis of data on the first 10 subjects using the SOUNDTEC DDHS indicates positive outcomes regarding safety and efficacy, although the small sample size is not sufficient to permit valid statistical inferences to be drawn from our preliminary data. Results also demonstrate improvement in performance compared with the subjects' optimally fit hearing aids and an improvement in quality of life as demonstrated by objective and subjective tests and measures."
"12438853","Middle ear electromagnetic semi-implantable hearing device: results of the phase II SOUNDTEC direct system clinical trial.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of the SOUNDTEC Direct System, a partially implantable electromagnetic middle ear hearing device.STUDY DESIGN: Food and Drug Administration Phase II clinical trial of 103 patients at 10 sites across the United States.SETTING: Tertiary referral medical centers.PATIENTS: Individuals with bilateral moderate to moderately severe sensorineural hearing impairment who had worn optimally fit hearing aids for at least 45 days.INTERVENTIONS: Therapeutic intervention included implantation of a 27-mg neodymium iron boron magnet encased in a laser-welded titanium canister onto the incudostapedial joint, followed, after a 10-week healing period, by fitting with a deep earmold coil assembly and activation of the sound processor.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Functional gain, speech recognition in quiet and noise, articulation index scores, perceived aided benefit, sound quality judgments, satisfaction, and presence of feedback and occlusion with the Direct System were compared with those of the patients' optimally fit hearing aid.RESULTS: The results of this multicenter clinical trial were submitted to the Food and Drug Administration on April 13, 2001, and are presented here. The results with the use of the SOUNDTEC Direct System compared with an optimally fit hearing aid provided an average 7.9-dB increase in functional gain in the speech frequencies (500-4,000 Hz) and a 9.6 dB gain in high frequencies (2,000, 3,000, and 4,000 Hz). There was a statistically significant average increase of 5.3% in speech discrimination. The mean speech perception in noise test score was improved, but the improvement was not statistically significant. Subjective tests using abbreviated profile of hearing aid benefit and the Hough Ear Institute Profile demonstrated scores statistically improved over the hearing aid condition. These subjective tests measured areas such as the presence of occlusion and feedback, speech quality judgments, device preference, and perceived aided benefit.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this Phase II clinical trial demonstrate that the SOUNDTEC Direct System provided statistically significant reduction in feedback and occlusive effect as well as a statistically significant improvement in all the following categories: functional gain, articulation index scores, speech discrimination in quiet, perceived aided benefit, patient satisfaction and device preference over the patient's optimally fit hearing aid."
"12403606","Effects of high-frequency emphasis and compression time constants on speech intelligibility in noise.","The objectives of the study were to evaluate the effect of different settings with regard to speech intelligibility in noise both objectively and subjectively and thus determine a favoured setting of compression time parameters, pre-set program (high-frequency emphasis) or combination for each individual user in a prospective study. Another objective was to evaluate the relationship between patient characteristics (e.g. slope of hearing loss) and favoured settings. In total, 38 subjects divided over five audiological centres were fitted with the Philips Spaceline D71-40 BTE digital hearing aid. Subjects were asked to compare three predefined compression algorithms with different time constants, slow (indicated by the manufacturer as AVC), intermediate (NORMAL) and fast (SYLLABIC) over two 4-week periods using the intermediate setting in both comparisons and randomizing over the fast and slow conditions. A randomization determined whether a subject started with the comfort-oriented pre-set program (AUTO) or the speech intelligibility-oriented setting with high-frequency emphasis (SPIN). In a third 4-week period, the pre-sets AUTO and SPIN were compared using the setting of the compression time constants that gave the best results during the first two periods. Comparisons were made using a standard speech-in-noise test with three types of noise: continuous speaker noise, modulated ICRA-4 noise, and car noise. The patients were also asked to fill in a Dutch translation and adaptation of the APHAB questionnaire to indicate their impression of performance. The results indicate that no compression algorithm, pre-set or combination is favoured overall. The largest improvement in speech-in-noise scores was found with syllabic compression. The advantageous effect of high-frequency emphasis after optimization of compression timing is small. The APHAB showed that users tend to prefer the SPIN setting. We found no relationship between favoured compression or pre-set and the degree or steepness of the hearing loss User preference and best performance in noise do not always coincide. Acclimatization may play a role. It could be advisable to let a user listen to a subjectively less favoured condition for at least some time if an optimal setting for speech intelligibility in noise is preferred over comfort."
"12170145","Determining the importance of fundamental hearing aid attributes.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the importance of fundamental hearing aid attributes and to elicit measures of satisfaction and dissatisfaction.STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study based on a survey using a decompositional approach of preference measurement (conjoint analysis).SETTING: Ear, nose, and throat university hospitals in Cologne and Giessen; various branches of hearing aid dispensers.PATIENTS: A random sample of 175 experienced hearing aid users aged 20 to 91 years (mean age, 61 yr) recruited at two different sites.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Relative importance of different hearing aid attributes, satisfaction and dissatisfaction with hearing aid attributes.RESULTS: Of the six fundamental hearing aid attributes assessed by the hearing aid users, the two features concerning speech perception attained the highest relative importance (25% speech in quiet, 27% speech in noise). The remaining four attributes (sound quality, handling, feedback, localization) had significantly lower values in a narrow range of 10 to 12%. Comparison of different subgroups of hearing aid wearers based on sociodemographic and user-specific data revealed a large interindividual scatter of the preferences for the attributes. A similar examination with 25 clinicians revealed overestimation of the importance of the attributes commonly associated with problems. Moreover, examination of satisfaction showed that speech in noise was the most frequent source of dissatisfaction (30% of all statements), whereas the subjects were satisfied with speech in quiet.CONCLUSIONS: The results emphasize the high importance of attributes related to speech perception. Speech discrimination in noise was the most important but also the most frequent source of negative statements. This attribute will be the outstanding parameter of future developments. Appropriate handling becomes an important factor for elderly subjects. However, because of the large interindividual scatter of data, the preferences of different hearing aid users were hardly predictable, giving evidence of multifactorial influences."
"12141388","Influence of environmental factors on hearing aid microphone preference.","The purpose of this study was to identify characteristics of everyday listening situations that influence user preferences for omnidirectional versus directional hearing aid microphones. Eleven experienced hearing aid users were fitted with digital hearing aids featuring switchable omnidirectional (OMNI) and adaptive-directional (DIR) modes (programs). For 6 weeks, their task was to identify and describe at least one listening situation each day in which one program performed better than the other using a checklist daily journal format. All participants reported difficulty identifying situations in which they could perceive a difference between the two microphone modes. Although an equal number had been requested, descriptions favoring the DIR outnumbered those for the OMNI. Chi-square tests were used to compare the distributions of 60 descriptions favoring the OMNI and 155 favoring the DIR across variables associated with the primary talker to whom the hearing aid user was listening, background noise, and other environmental characteristics. The results indicated that location of the primary talker, presence or absence and type of background noise, and type of space in which the communication occurred influenced microphone choice."
"11833991","A test to measure subjective and objective speech intelligibility.","Measurement of hearing aid outcome is particularly difficult because there are numerous dimensions to consider (e.g., performance, satisfaction, benefit). Often there are discrepancies between scores in these dimensions. It is difficult to reconcile these discrepancies because the materials and formats used to measure each dimension are so very different. We report data obtained with an outcome measure that examines both objective and subjective dimensions with the same test format and materials and gives results in the same unit of measurement (signal-to-noise ratio). Two variables are measured: a &quot;performance&quot; speech reception threshold and a &quot;perceptual&quot; speech reception threshold. The signal-to-noise ratio difference between these is computed to determine the perceptual-performance discrepancy (PPDIS). The results showed that, on average, 48 percent of the variance in subjective ratings of a hearing aid could be explained by a combination of the performance speech reception threshold and the PPDIS. These findings suggest that the measure is potentially a valuable clinical tool."
"11808724","Personal and social conditions potentially influencing women's hearing loss management.","Little gender-specific data related to hearing loss and hearing loss management are available. The purpose of this investigation was to examine personal and social conditions affecting women at selected stages of the adult life course that may influence hearing loss management. In all, 191 women in three age groups, ranging from 35 to 85 years old, participated. None reported hearing problems. Participants completed a demographic data form and were given a standard audiometric evaluation to confirm age-normal hearing. Each completed assessments of speech understanding in quiet and noise, auditory signal duration discrimination, and binaural processing. Measures of hearing knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes; health-related locus of control; ego strength; and, social support were administered. Results revealed that although some variables deteriorate among subsequent age groups (i.e., hearing thresholds, central auditory processing, and ego strength), the reverse is true for others (i.e., social interaction and satisfaction with income). Age-specific sociodemographic burdens that may interfere with hearing loss management were noted. New psychosocial data are revealed against which women and men with impaired hearing may be compared."
"11801925","Verification of improved patient outcomes with a partially implantable hearing aid, The SOUNDTEC direct hearing system.","INTRODUCTION: Partially implantable hearing devices have been developed to address some of the user-perceived shortcomings of standard amplification systems. Partially implantable devices are purported to provide improved sound quality as a result of decreased occlusion, decreased feedback, and enhanced clarity resulting from increased high-frequency gain. Such improvements may result in greater user satisfaction. To justify selection of a partially implantable device and undergoing a minor surgical procedure, verification techniques must be used to document user improvement or increased satisfaction over conventional amplification.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patient satisfaction with the SOUNDTEC direct hearing system.STUDY DESIGN: Within-subjects repeated measures design.METHODS: Objective and subjective evaluation pre- and post-implantation with the SOUNDTEC device. Verification techniques included tonal functional gain measures with traditional amplification and the SOUNDTEC device, word recognition in quiet (NU-6) and in noise (SPIN), the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB), and the Hough Ear Institute Profile (HEIP).RESULTS: Although there was no significant difference between optimal traditional amplification and the SOUNDTEC device for speech perception measures, the SOUNDTEC device yielded statistically significant increased high-frequency functional gain. Subjective reports indicated that the SOUNDTEC device provides a cleaner, more natural sound without feedback than traditional amplification.CONCLUSIONS: Partially implantable hearing aids may address some of the limitations of traditional amplification systems."
"11770672","Comparing loudness normalization (IHAFF) with speech intelligibility maximization (NAL-NL1) when implemented in a two-channel device.","OBJECTIVE: At least two rationales are available for fitting wide dynamic range compression hearing aids. The goal of one rationale is to normalize loudness, and the goal of the second rationale is to maximize speech intelligibility. Neither rationale has been validated against other fitting rationales for the range of input levels common to the hearing aid user in the real world. The goal of the study was to compare the two rationales when implemented in a 2-channel compression hearing aid.DESIGN: Loudness normalization and speech intelligibility maximization were implemented using the Independent Hearing Aid Fitting Forum (IHAFF) and the National Acoustic Laboratories' Nonlinear (NAL-NL1) prescriptive formulas. Twenty-four subjects (eight for each of three groups of mild flat, moderate/severe flat, and steeply sloping hearing loss) participated in the study. Each subject completed an initial laboratory test, field test, and final laboratory test. The laboratory test consisted of a paired-comparison judgment for each prescriptive formula using four stimuli under both quiet and noisy listening conditions and a sentence recognition test using Bamford-Kowal-Bench sentences. In the field test, subjects evaluated the two rationales in individually selected everyday listening conditions for 4 wk. A digital simulation of the fitting rationales implemented in two channels was used for laboratory testing and a digital 2-memory, 2-channel device was used for field testing. Subjects adjusted the overall gain of each response to their preferred listening level in both the laboratory and in the field.RESULTS: Data collected in the laboratory before and after the field test showed no indication of significant learning or acclimatization effects. For each stimulus presented in the paired-comparison test more subjects preferred NAL-NL1 than preferred IHAFF. For the sentence recognition test, subjects performed significantly better with NAL-NL1 than IHAFF in a low-frequency weighted background noise. Sixteen out of 22 subjects who completed the field test reported a preference for the NAL-NL1 response. The remaining six subjects preferred IHAFF. The paired-comparison test and field test revealed that while the achieved root-mean-square (rms) difference between fittings for an input level of 65 dB SPL was small, the preference for either rationale was small. As the rms difference between fittings increased, the score in favor of NAL-NL1 increased. The correlation between the differences in satisfaction score obtained in the field test and the rms differences between the responses fitted was statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: When the two fitting rationales prescribed substantially different responses for a 65 dB SPL input and these differences were achieved in the fitting, then the subjects preferred NAL-NL1. Even when the difference between fittings was small, the subjects preferred and performed better with NAL-NL1 when listening in a low-frequency weighted background noise."
"12701753","Bone-anchored hearing aids in unilateral inner ear deafness.","In nine patients with unilateral deafness and normal hearing in the contralateral ear, measurements of sound localization and speech perception were obtained before intervention, with a conventional contralateral routing of sound (CROS) hearing aid and later with a bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) implanted in the deaf ear. Sound localization did not show any differences between the three conditions. Speech perception using short, everyday sentences showed a reduction in the head-shadow effect of 2 dB for both the conventional CROS hearing aid and the BAHA in comparison to the unaided condition. Patients' real-life experiences of the three conditions were evaluated using the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) questionnaire. The results showed a significant benefit with the BAHA in situations involving background noise and reverberation and a reduced aversion to loud sounds in comparison to the unaided and conventional CROS conditions."
"12647894","An examination of changes in hearing-aid performance and benefit in the elderly over a 3-year period of hearing-aid use.","This brief report describes the changes in hearing-aid performance and benefit in 9 elderly hearing-aid wearers over a 3-year period following the hearing-aid fitting. Objective measures of hearing-aid performance included three measures of speech recognition: (a) the Nonsense Syllable Test (NST) presented at 65 dB SPL and a +8 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), (b) the Connected Speech Test (CST) presented at 50 dB SPL in quiet, and (c) the CST presented at 65 dB SPL and a +8 dB SNR. Subjective, self-report measures of hearing-aid benefit included the Hearing Aid Performance Inventory (HAPI; B. E. Walden, M. E. Demorest, &amp; E. L. Helper, 1984) and the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE; I. Ventry &amp; B. Weinstein, 1982). Performance and benefit measures were obtained at postfit intervals of 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years using a standardized measurement protocol. Individual data were evaluated using 95% critical differences established previously for each benefit measure and applied around the scores observed at the 1-month postfit interval. Little evidence was seen for systematic improvement in aided performance or benefit, consistent with that expected from acclimatization, in any participant or for any measure of benefit."
"12544032","Comparison of the bone anchored hearing aid implantable hearing device with contralateral routing of offside signal amplification in the rehabilitation of unilateral deafness.","OBJECTIVE: Monaural hearing imposes constraints under many listening conditions. The authors compared the effects of a semi-implantable bone conductor, the Entific bone anchored hearing aid, with conventional contralateral routing of offside signal amplification to assess rehabilitative benefit in adults with unilateral deafness.DESIGN: Prospective trials of subjects with unilateral deafness using benefit surveys, source identification testing, and hearing in noise testing.SETTING: Tertiary referral center, outpatient surgical and audiologic services.PATIENTS: Adults with unilateral deafness (pure tone average &gt;90 dB, SD &lt;20%) after acoustic neuroma excision (n = 7), meningitis (n = 1), sudden sensorineural hearing loss (n = 1), and sudden sensorineural hearing loss with chronic suppurative otitis media (n = 1). Entry criteria included normal hearing in the contralateral ear (pure tone average &lt;25 dB, SD &gt;80%).INTERVENTION: Subjects were fitted with contralateral routing of offside signal amplification devices for 1 month and tested with contralateral routing of offside signal before mastoid implantation of the deaf ear, fitting, and testing for bone anchored hearing aid.OUTCOME MEASURES: Subjects' assessment of experience with their devices and patterns of use, 2) source azimuth identification in noise test, and 3) speech discrimination in quiet and in noise under conditions of noise-front, noise-to-normal-ear, and noise-to-deaf-ear.RESULTS: There was consistent satisfaction with bone anchored hearing aid implantation and amplification, and poor acceptance of contralateral routing of offside signal amplification. Sound localization was poor at baseline and with both bone anchored hearing aid and contralateral routing of offside signal. Relative to baseline, contralateral routing of offside signal and bone anchored hearing aid produced significantly better speech recognition in noise under most conditions. The bone anchored hearing aid enabled significantly better speech recognition than contralateral routing of offside signal in quiet and in a composite of noise conditions. The advantages may relate to averting the interference of speech signals delivered to the better ear, as occurs with conventional contralateral routing of offside signal amplification.CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary data in subjects with normal monaural hearing indicate that vibromechanical stimulation with the bone anchored hearing aid overcomes some of the negative head shadow effects in unilateral deafness. The bone anchored hearing aid system, when placed on the side of a deaf ear, yields greater benefit in subjects with normal monaural hearing than does contralateral routing of offside signal amplification. It seems that this rehabilitative approach can expand the sound field of monaural listeners in further enhancing speech understanding. Observations suggest that further understanding of bone conduction as implemented in transcranial stimulation will guide further options for patients with monaural hearing. Longer follow-up will help to determine whether communicative skill improvements with the bone anchored hearing aid outweigh the disadvantages of implantation surgery, costs, and device maintenance."
"15603458","Comparison of speech perception in background noise with acceptance of background noise in aided and unaided conditions.","Background noise is a significant factor influencing hearing-aid satisfaction and is a major reason for rejection of hearing aids. Attempts have been made by previous researchers to relate the use of hearing aids to speech perception in noise (SPIN), with an expectation of improved speech perception followed by an increased acceptance of hearing aids. Unfortunately, SPIN was not related to hearing-aid use or satisfaction. A new measure of listener reaction to background noise has been proposed. The acceptable noise level (ANL), expressed in decibels, is defined as a difference between the most comfortable listening level for speech and the highest background noise level that is acceptable when listening to and following a story. The ANL measure assumes that speech understanding in noise may not be as important as is the willingness to listen in the presence of noise. It has been established that people who accept background noise have smaller ANLs and tend to be &quot;good&quot; users of hearing aids. Conversely, people who cannot accept background noise have larger ANLs and may only use hearing aids occasionally or reject them altogether. Because this is a new measure, it was important to determine the reliability of the ANL over time with and without hearing aids, to determine the effect of acclimatization to hearing aids, and to compare the ANL to well-established measures such as speech perception scores collected with the SPIN test. Results from 50 listeners indicate that for both good and occasional hearing aid users, the ANL is comparable in reliability to the SPIN test and that both measures do not change with acclimatization. The ANLs and SPIN scores are unrelated. Although the SPIN scores improve with amplification, the ANLs are unaffected by amplification, suggesting that the ANL is inherent to an individual and can be established prior to hearing aid fitting as a possible predictor of hearing-aid use."
"15592858","Detecting components of hearing aid fitting using a self-assessment-inventory.","The evaluation of hearing-aid fitting includes numerous assessments such as electro- and psychoacoustic tests. The subjective estimation of the hearing aid user can be elicited with self-assessment inventories encompassing various parameters, e.g., benefit, satisfaction and usage. A questionnaire comprising 11 domains (disability, handicap, frequency and significance of the listening situation, importance of the hearing aid, expectation, demand, aided performance, benefit, satisfaction and usage) within three different conditions (speech in quiet and in noise and listening to sounds) was used to detect components underlying hearing aid fitting. The data show a three-factor structure (situation-, restriction- and aid-related variables) independent from the conditions. Usage depends on all of the three factors. Disability and handicap reveal the highest values for speech in noise, whereas the aid-related factor shows the lowest values for this condition. Global satisfaction with the hearing aid is significantly correlated with the aid-related factor, but independent from the restriction of hearing. The aid-related factor is positively influenced by the amount of social activity because more active persons report higher benefit and satisfaction for all listening conditions. Age does not exhibit a significant relationship to one of the components. Basically, all correlation coefficients are only intermediate, revealing that inter-individual differences of the patients are rather high. The data indicate that extra-audiological factors might also play an important role in the success of hearing aid fitting."
"15506497","Relationship between laboratory measures of directional advantage and everyday success with directional microphone hearing aids.","The improvement in speech recognition in noise obtained with directional microphones compared to omnidirectional microphones is referred to as the directional advantage. Laboratory studies have revealed substantial differences in the magnitude of the directional advantage across hearing-impaired listeners. This investigation examined whether persons who were successful users of directional microphone hearing aids in everyday living tended to obtain a larger directional advantage in the test booth than persons who were unsuccessful users. Results revealed that the mean directional advantage did not differ significantly between patients who used the directional mode regularly and those who reported little or no benefit from directional microphones in daily living and, therefore, tended to leave their hearing aids set in the default omnidirectional mode. Success with directional microphone hearing aids in everyday living, therefore, cannot be reliably predicted by the magnitude of the directional advantage obtained in the clinic."
"15506496","Predicting success with hearing aids in everyday living.","Persons with impaired hearing who are candidates for amplification are not all equally successful with hearing aids in daily living. Having the ability to predict success with amplification in everyday life from measures that can be obtained during an initial evaluation of the patient's candidacy would result in greater patient satisfaction with hearing aids and more efficient use of clinical resources. This study investigated the relationship between various demographic and audiometric measures, and two measures of hearing aid success in 50 hearing aid wearers. Audiometric predictors included measures of audibility and suprathreshold distortion. The unaided and aided signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss on the QuickSIN test provided the best predictors of hearing aid success in daily living. However, much of this predictive relationship appeared attributable to the patient's age."
"15372170","[Identifying factors before the provision of hearing aids. Results from a pilot study].","OBJECTIVE: Systematic research on factors before the provision of hearing aids is scarce. In order to identify parameters which promote or impede the use of hearing aids, a questionnaire-based survey was conducted.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 35 randomly chosen, hard of hearing adults indicated for a hearing aid were examined. The importance of speech in quiet and in noise, wearing comfort, sound quality, appearance and costs, as well as expectations, willingness to use a hearing aid and reasons for and against provision were determined.RESULTS: Speech in noise and quiet were most important, followed by comfort of wearing and appearance of the aid. Expectations towards the hearing aids were in general high. The willingness to use hearing devices was positively affected by the expectation that it would improve quality of life and negatively by the amount of social activity of the person. The main reasons against the use of hearing aids were appearance and lack of confidence in hearing aid technology.CONCLUSIONS: This pilot-study identified several parameters which might affect willingness to use hearing aids. In particular, expectations towards the aids, personal attitude towards hearing and communication problems and the appearance of hearing aids should be subject to further examination."
"15316629","[Check of hearing aid fitting].","A qualified hearing aid fitting is only possible if the ENT doctor not only prescribes the device, but also conscientiously checks the comparative adjustments made by the hearing aid acoustician. In deciding, which of the tested hearing aids achieves the best and most appropriate improvement of hearing, the physician should first thoroughly study the acoustician's fitting protocol, which contains comparative results of all devices tested. The subjective satisfaction of the patient with his hearing aid can be determined in a detailed conversation or with a special questionnaire. The examination of the otoplastic is as necessary as the improvement of speech discrimination under free field conditions, especially with additional noise. With in situ measurement, the individual transmission characteristics of the hearing aid and the otoplastic are tested in a few minutes. Conscientious control of the fitted hearing aid is only possible with loudness scaling. The scaling function shows clearly whether the fitted aid has adequate amplification, is not too loudly adjusted, and whether the field of pleasant hearing has been considered."
"15250124","Comparison of three procedures for initial fitting of compression hearing aids. III. Inexperienced versus experienced users.","We assessed whether gain requirements differ for experienced users and new users when fitted with multi-band compression hearing aids Three procedures for initial fitting were used: the Cambridge method for loudness equalization (CAMEQ), the Cambridge method for loudness restoration (CAMREST), and the desired sensation level input/output (DSL[i/o]) method. Twenty experienced hearing aid users and 20 new users with mild-to-severe sensorineural loss were fitted with Danalogic 163D digital hearing aids, using each procedure in turn in a counter-balanced order. The new users were given a pre-fitting with slightly reduced gains prior to the 'formal' fitting. Immediately after formal fitting with a given procedure, and 1 week after fitting, the gains were adjusted by the minimum amount necessary to achieve acceptable fittings. The amount of adjustment required provided the main measure of the adequacy of the initial fitting. On average, new users required decreases in gain for all procedures, the decreases being larger for DSL[i/o] than for CAMEQ or CAMREST. For experienced users, gain adjustments were small for CAMEQ and CAMREST, but were larger and mostly negative for DSL[i/o]. After these gain adjustments, users wore the aids for at least 3 weeks before filling out the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) questionnaire and taking part in laboratory measurements of the speech reception threshold (SRT) for sentences in quiet and in steady and fluctuating background noise at levels of 60 and 75 dBSPL. The scores on the APHAB test and the SRTs did not differ significantly for the three procedures. We conclude that the CAMEQ and CAMREST procedures provide more appropriate initial fittings than DSL[i/o]. For inexperienced users, gains typically need to be reduced by about 3dB relative to those prescribed by CAMEQ or CAMREST, although the amount of reduction may depend on hearing loss. An analysis of gain adjustments as a function of order of testing provided some evidence for increased tolerance to high-frequency amplification with increasing experience during the 4-month course of the trial, but this effect did not differ for the experienced and new users."
"15224866","Clinical trial of a low-cost, solar-powered hearing aid.","OBJECTIVE: In July 2001 the World Health Organization (WHO) launched their &quot;Guidelines for hearing aids and services for developing countries&quot;. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of an analogue, low-cost, behind-the-ear hearing aid (BTE-HA) that met the minimum technical requirements outlined by the WHO.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 25 subjects (17 males, 8 females; median age 74 years; range 50-86 years) were recruited among patients referred for audiological evaluation who consented to participate in the trial. All subjects had a hearing loss of &lt; or = 60 dB HL at 2 kHz, were mobile and mentally unimpaired; 13 were experienced users of HAs, 3 suffered from mixed conductive/sensorineural hearing impairment (HI) and the remainder had pure sensorineural HI. Based on pure-tone, speech and impedance audiometry the BTE-HAs were fitted, using the National Acoustic Laboratories-R (NAL-R) prescription rule, 21 binaurally and 4 monaurally. All fittings were validated by insertion gain measurements, and the immediate benefit was measured by means of the speech recognition score in background noise (SRSN; signal:noise ratio = 10 dB) without and with the HA. After a 6-week trial period a structured interview based on the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HAs) was performed.RESULTS: The results showed that the amplification of the HA deviated significantly from the NAL-R target at all frequencies, giving significantly more amplification at 500 and 1000 Hz despite maximum bass-cut, whenever relevant, and significantly less amplification as required at 2, 3 and 4 kHz. The median SRSN without HA was 48% (range 0-96%), which improved significantly to 80% (range 24-100%) with HA. The median individual difference in SRSN without and with HA was 20% (range 0-72%). The total IOI-HA score with the test HA was 4.1 (range 2.6-4.6), showing that it offered subjectively high satisfaction and reduction in limitations of activity.CONCLUSIONS: The low-cost HA: (i) provides benefit to the hearing-impaired person; (ii) offers poor amplification in the high frequencies; and (iii) gives subjective satisfaction similar to that for modern available HAs."
"15198378","Relative benefits of linear analogue and advanced digital hearing aids.","Speech recognition performance and self-reported benefit from linear analogue and advanced (digital) hearing aids were compared in 100 first-time hearing aid users with mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss fitted monaurally with a behind-the-ear (BTE) hearing aid in a single-blind randomized crossover trial. Subjects used each aid for 5 weeks in turn, with aid order balanced across subjects. Three alternative models of digital hearing aid were assigned to subjects according to a balanced design. Aid type was disguised to keep subjects blind within practical limitations. Aided speech recognition performance in noise was measured at speech levels of 65 and 75dB at a speech-to-noise ratio (SNR) of +2dB for closed sets of single words. Self-rated benefit was measured using the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) and the Glasgow Hearing Aid Benefit Profile (GHABP). Quality of life, hearing aid use and user preferences were also assessed. Speech recognition scores with the digital aids were significantly better at 75dB than with the analogue aids Self-reported benefit (APHAB, GHABP) and improvement in quality of life were generally not significantly different between analogue and digital aids, although aversiveness measured with the APHAB was significantly lower with digital aids, and satisfaction measured with the GHABP was greater. The digital aids were preferred significantly more often than the analogue aids, with 61 subjects choosing their digital aid, 26 choosing the analogue aid, and nine being equivocal. Overall, this study shows advantages for advanced digital over simple linear analogue aids in terms of both objective and subjective outcomes, although average differences are not large."
"15064930","[Factors influencing rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss with hearing aids].","BACKGROUND: A large proportion of older as well as younger patients do not use their hearing aids. Of the younger hearing impaired population, this occurs in the majority of those who do not benefit sufficiently from their hearing aids and, consequently, they face difficulties in their working and social life.SCIENTIFIC QUESTION: Our aim was to evaluate whether a classical hearing aid adjustment is of sufficient predictive value to determine whether adequate rehabilitation in everyday and professional life will occur.METHODS AND RESULTS: A questionnaire was returned by 197 adult hearing impaired patients. Only 108 were using their hearing aids all the time; 57 rarely and 32 never. The main reason for this low rehabilitation rate proved to be inadequate amplification. At the workplace, insufficient speech discrimination came into play. Another important factor was dysacusis induced by specific noise signals. There was an intolerable acoustic feedback in 40% which could not be sufficiently alleviated. Taking these results into account, only about a third of patients were sufficiently rehabilitated.CONCLUSIONS: Proof of effectiveness in a typical audiological testing situation is an important but not a fully reliable predictor for effectiveness in everyday life. Even when hearing aids are shown to be effective with such testing, their application in particular everyday or work situations may be insufficient of even impossible."
"15064661","Is normal or less than normal overall loudness preferred by first-time hearing aid users?","OBJECTIVE: Most prescriptive methods for nonlinear, wide dynamic range compression (WDRC) hearing aids are based on the assumption that a hearing-impaired listener should perceive amplified sounds at the same overall loudness as would a normal-hearing listener without amplification. However, some previous research on linear amplification has indicated that subjects prefer less overall gain than prescribed by the most commonly used prescriptive method for linear hearing aids, NAL-R, a method that gives close to normal overall loudness for a mid-level input. The current study aims at comparing two prescriptive methods for WDRC hearing aids. The methods differ in the overall loudness they aim to give the hearing aid user. One method, called NormLoudn, is based on a generic method that prescribes gain so that the overall loudness is restored to normal. Another method, called LessLoudn, is based on a hearing aid specific prescription, and gives the hearing aid user less than normal overall loudness. Do first-time hearing aid users prefer the method that restores overall loudness to normal or the method that gives less than normal overall loudness?DESIGN: Twenty-one first-time hearing aid users with typical hearing losses for this group of clients participated in a crossover blinded field study where the two fitting methods were compared using a multi-programmable hearing aid, Danalogic 163D. Preference in the field was evaluated using interview, questionnaire, and diary. The field test was accompanied by laboratory tests, which included paired comparison judgments of preference and loudness and a speech recognition test. Loudness calculations were also used when interpreting the results, and a theoretical comparison with other prescriptive methods for WDRC hearing aids was made.RESULTS: After necessary adjustments, the measured gain for the two methods was similar in gain-frequency shape, but NormLoudn gave more overall gain than LessLoudn. Generally, NormLoudn fittings led to calculated overall loudness that was close to normal, whereas LessLoudn fittings, in median, led to 3-7 phon less than normal calculated overall loudness according to the loudness model used. During the interview performed after the field test, 19 out of the 21 subjects stated that they preferred LessLoudn. Also the questionnaire and the diary showed a clear preference for LessLoudn in all types of listening situations. Paired comparisons of preference in the laboratory supported the findings in the field. LessLoudn was preferred to NormLoudn in all tested situations, except for soft speech in very soft noise where there was no significant preference for either method. Speech recognition scores were similar for the two fittings. The difference in calculated loudness was clearly distinguishable to the subjects and seemed to govern their preferences.CONCLUSIONS: LessLoudn, which gave less than normal overall loudness according to the loudness model used, was preferred both in the field and in the laboratory tests. Speech recognition scores were similar for both methods. A comparison between the measured gain for NormLoudn and the gain prescribed by CAMEQ, NAL-NL1, and DSL[i/o], suggests that all three prescriptive procedures (DSL[i/o] in particular) would probably overestimate the required gain for subjects without hearing aid experience and with mild to moderate hearing loss. When providing these clients with hearing aids, it seems important to include a careful adjustment of the overall gain to avoid overamplification if the prescription used aims at restoring overall loudness to normal according to the loudness model used here."
"16295231","Fitting hearing aids using clinical prefitting speech measures: an evidence-based review.","A systematic review of the literature addressed the question &quot;Is there evidence of a good correlation between unaided prefitting speech measures and aided satisfaction on self-report measures?&quot; This restricted question is only one of several possible questions related to speech measures and hearing aid fittings. The levels of evidence that were accepted included meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and nonrandomized intervention studies. Nearly 300 articles and book chapters were identified during the initial search; 220 were eliminated on the basis of their abstracts; and 80 papers and book chapters were reviewed in depth. Five studies met the criteria set forth in this review. No significant correlation between traditional unaided prefitting speech measures and aided satisfaction was found in any of the five studies. One of the studies showed a correlation between the results of a prefitting speech-in-noise test and self-reported aided satisfaction."
"16078730","Comparison of two adaptive procedures for fitting a multi-channel compression hearing aid.","We compared two adaptive procedures for fitting a multi-channel compression hearing aid. &quot;Camadapt&quot; uses judgements of the loudness of speech stimuli and the tonal quality of music stimuli. &quot;Eartuner&quot; uses judgements of the loudness and clarity of speech stimuli with differing spectral characteristics. Sixteen new users of hearing aids were fitted unilaterally, using each procedure. The fittings were assigned to Programs 1 and 2 in the aid, in a counter-balanced order. Subjects kept a diary of their experiences with each program in everyday life. Following 2-4 weeks of experience, they filled in the APHAB and other questionnaires and were re-fitted using both procedures. Camadapt generally led to higher low-level gains and lower high-level gains than Eartuner. Gains recommended by the procedures did not change following experience. Eight subjects preferred the Camadapt fitting and eight preferred the Eartuner fitting. Most subjects gave high overall satisfaction ratings for both procedures. Test-retest reliability was better for Eartuner than for Camadapt. Preference for the Camadapt fitting was associated with slightly better speech communication with Camadapt, while preference for the Eartuner fitting was associated with fewer problems with aversion for that procedure."
"16012028","Digital hearing aids for high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss: preliminary experience with the RetroX device.","CONCLUSIONS: The RetroX outer ear hearing aid seems to represent a means of overcoming problems with understanding speech in noise in patients with high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) without the need to wear conventional completely-in-the-canal (CIC) hearing aids, which are usually reported to annoy patients as a result of the occlusion effect.OBJECTIVE: To present preliminary data from a study carried out to compare the efficacy, in the same individual, of a standard digital CIC hearing aid and a new implantable outer ear canal device, the RetroX.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three out of 15 adults affected by high-frequency SNHL who were candidates for auditory rehabilitation were evaluated by using speech audiometric tests in quiet and noise as well as a questionnaire shortly after use of a CIC hearing aid and the RetroX device, i.e. at 7 and 14 days. The efficacy of the RetroX was anticipated by testing all the subjects using a RetroX simulating system before starting the study protocol.RESULTS: In all three implanted patients, the RetroX provided better audiological benefit for speech understanding in noise. These findings were corroborated by the results of the questionnaire, which showed greater satisfaction with the RetroX, especially regarding the absence of the occlusion effect."
"15913157","Sound quality judgements of new hearing instrument users over a 24-week post-fitting period.","The time course of changes in perceived sound quality after hearing instrument fitting has not been studied systematically It is possible, for example, that patients may object to additional high frequency gain when fitted, but not after a period of auditory acclimatisation. The aim of this study was to utilise sound quality judgements to compare two frequency responses in new users at 4-week intervals over a 24-week post-fitting period. The null hypothesis was that there would be no change in sound quality judgements over time. A total of 16 elderly subjects were fitted monaurally with the same model of linear, programmable hearing instrument. This was set to a standard response that provided 26-29 dB of real-ear insertion gain at 2000 4000 Hz. This program was worn by the subjects for the duration of the study. All subjects reported greater than four hours of daily use. The alternative response which was used in a paired comparison paradigm, provided a mean gain reduction of 3, 8, 13, and 16 dB at 2000, 3000, 4000 and 6000 Hz, respectively. Subjects compared the standard and the alternative responses for sound quality along dimensions of comfort, clarity, and overall preference while listening to running speech presented in quiet, steady noise, and speech babble. At the time of fitting there was a small preference for the standard response when judging clarity, but the alternative response was preferred for comfort and preferred overall. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) for each quality dimension did not reveal any statistically significant change over time. It is concluded that this pattern of preference is unaffected by acclimatisation to amplification, at least over the initial 24 weeks of instrument use."
"15807049","The effects of expansion on the objective and subjective performance of hearing instrument users.","The present study investigated the effects of expansion on the objective and subjective performance of 20 hearing instrument users fitted binaurally with digital ITE products. Objective performance was evaluated in quiet using the Connected Speech Test and in noise using the Hearing in Noise Test. Subjective performance was evaluated in two ways: (a) by having each participant rate their satisfaction regarding the amount of noise reduction they perceived in each expansion condition on a daily basis and (b) by having each participant indicate which expansion condition they preferred following the completion of a two-week trial. Results indicated that expansion significantly reduced low-level speech perception performance; however, satisfaction and preference ratings significantly increased when using expansion. The effect of degree of hearing loss, expansion kneepoint, and expansion ratio on the effectiveness of expansion for a given listener was discussed."

"17153718","Effect of multichannel digital signal processing on loudness comfort, sentence recognition, and sound quality.","This study evaluated the effect of increasing the number of processing channels from 32- to 64-signal processing channels on subjects' loudness comfort and satisfaction, sentence recognition, and sound quality of his or her own voice. Ten experienced hearing aid users with mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss wore behind-the-ear (BTE) hearing aids with Adaptive Dynamic Range Optimization (ADRO) signal processing for a period of six weeks in the 32-channel and 64-channel conditions. Results revealed no significant differences in loudness comfort or satisfaction for the majority of sound samples as measured by the Subjective Loudness Test and Environmental Sounds Questionnaire. No significant differences in sentence recognition between the two processing conditions were found as measured by the Hearing In Noise Test (HINT). Additionally, no subjective differences in sound quality of subjects' own voice were determined by the Listening Tasks Questionnaire."
"16959733","Amplification with digital noise reduction and the perception of annoying and aversive sounds.","Hearing aid users report difficulties using their hearing aids in noisy environments. Problems include understanding speech, loudness discomfort, and annoyance with background noise. Digital noise reduction algorithms have been promoted as a method to solve speech understanding and comfort in noise problems. Research has failed to find improved speech understanding in noise. Little is known about how digital noise reduction affects noise annoyance and aversiveness. The goals of this investigation were to determine how a specific digital noise reduction system affects hearing aid users' perception of noise annoyance and aversiveness and to compare their perceptions to those of normal-hearing listeners. Ratings of noise annoyance and of aversiveness were obtained from 49 participants with moderate sensorineural hearing loss before fitting and after 3 weeks of hearing aid use. Findings were compared to measures obtained from normal-hearing listeners. Perceived annoyance and aversiveness increased with amplification. Annoyance and aversiveness with the hearing aid approximated normal perception. The results of this investigation suggest the need for counseling patients about realistic expectations related to annoyance and aversiveness of sounds at the time of hearing aid fitting."
"16927516","Improving speech intelligibility in background noise with an adaptive directional microphone.","Omnidirectional, supercardioid, and adaptive directional microphones (ADM) were evaluated in combination with the ADRO amplification scheme for eight participants with moderate sloping hearing losses. The ADM produced better speech perception scores than the other two microphones in all noise conditions. Participants performed the Hearing in Noise Test sentences at -4.5 dB SNR or better, which is similar to the level achievable with normal hearing. The Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale indicated no disadvantages of using the ADM relative to the omnidirectional microphone in real-life situations. The ADM was preferred over the omnidirectional microphone in 54% of situations, compared to 17% preferences for the omnidirectional microphone, and 29% no preference. The combination of the ADM to improve SNR, and ADRO to keep the signal output comfortable and audible provided near-normal hearing performance for people with moderate hearing loss. The ADM is the recommended microphone configuration for ADRO hearing aids."
"16787899","The effects of high-frequency amplification on the objective and subjective performance of hearing instrument users with varying degrees of high-frequency hearing loss.","PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to determine if amplifying beyond 2 kHz affected the objective and subjective performance of hearing instrument users with varying degrees of mild-to-severe high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss.METHOD: Twenty participants were fitted binaurally with digital completely-in-the-canal devices with 4-channel wide dynamic range compression (Starkey Axent). Each participant used the hearing instruments for two 6-week trial periods. Each hearing instrument was programmed to maximize high-frequency audibility during 1 trial period and minimize high-frequency audibility during the other trial period. Objective evaluations were conducted in quiet using the Connected Speech Test (CST) and in noise using the CST and the Hearing in Noise Test. Subjective performance was evaluated by administering the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit and a questionnaire.RESULTS: Results indicated that high-frequency amplification significantly improved objective performance in noise and subjective preference in quiet for listeners with varying degrees of mild-to-severe high-frequency hearing loss. Results also suggested that high-frequency amplification may affect subjective preference in noise and overall for listeners with varying degrees of mild-to-severe high-frequency hearing loss when feedback is eliminated.CONCLUSION: Based on these significant benefits, dispensers should be aware that high-frequency amplification should, at least initially, be provided to the affected high-frequency regions when mild-to-severe hearing loss is present."
"16672792","The Performance-Perceptual Test (PPT) and its relationship to aided reported handicap and hearing aid satisfaction.","OBJECTIVE: Results of objective clinical tests (e.g., measures of speech understanding in noise) often conflict with subjective reports of hearing aid benefit and satisfaction. The Performance-Perceptual Test (PPT) is an outcome measure in which objective and subjective evaluations are made by using the same test materials, testing format, and unit of measurement (signal-to-noise ratio, S/N), permitting a direct comparison between measured and perceived ability to hear. Two variables are measured: a Performance Speech Reception Threshold in Noise (SRTN) for 50% correct performance and a Perceptual SRTN, which is the S/N at which listeners perceive that they can understand the speech material. A third variable is computed: the Performance-Perceptual Discrepancy (PPDIS); it is the difference between the Performance and Perceptual SRTNs and measures the extent to which listeners &quot;misjudge&quot; their hearing ability. Saunders et al. in 2004 examined the relation between PPT scores and unaided hearing handicap. In this publication, the relations between the PPT, residual aided handicap, and hearing aid satisfaction are described.DESIGN: Ninety-four individuals between the ages of 47 and 86 yr participated. All had symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss and had worn binaural hearing aids for at least 6 wk before participating. All subjects underwent routine audiological examination and completed the PPT, the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly/Adults (HHIE/A), and the Satisfaction for Amplification in Daily Life questionnaire. Sixty-five subjects attended one research visit for participation in this study, and 29 attended a second visit to complete the PPT a second time.RESULTS: Performance and Perceptual SRTN and PPDIS scores were normally distributed and showed excellent test-retest reliability. Aided SRTNs were significantly better than unaided SRTNs; aided and unaided PPDIS values did not differ. Stepwise multiple linear regression showed that the PPDIS, the Performance SRTN, and age were significant predictors of scores on the HHIE/A such that greater reported handicap is associated with underestimating hearing ability, poorer aided ability to understand speech in noise, and being younger. Scores on the Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life were not well explained by the PPT, age, or audiometric thresholds. When individuals were grouped by their HHIE/A scores, it was seen that individuals who report more handicap than expected based on their audiometric thresholds, have a more negative PPDIS, i.e., underestimate their hearing ability, relative to individuals who report expected handicap, who in turn have a more negative PPDIS than individuals who report less handicap than expected. No such patterns were apparent for the Performance SRTN.CONCLUSIONS: The study showed the PPT to be a reliable outcome measure that can provide more information than a performance measure and/or a questionnaire measure alone, in that the PPDIS can provide the clinician with an explanation for discrepant objective and subjective reports of hearing difficulties. The finding that self-reported handicap is affected independently by both actual ability to hear and the (mis)perception of ability to hear underscores the difficulty clinicians encounter when trying to interpret outcomes questionnaires. We suggest that this variable should be measured and taken into account when interpreting questionnaires and counseling patients."
"16482466","[The tasks of the ENT specialist by hearing aid fitting. Part 2: checking the fit, subjective satisfaction, ear mold and hearing aid].","The second part of this series deals with the tasks of the ENT-specialist, who must not endorse the prescription before making sure that the hearing aid recommended by the acoustician will bring sufficient hearing improvement, and that the suggested hearing aid is suitable. The report and audiograms of the acoustician must be compared to his own results, and a check of whether at least three hearing aids from different companies have been compared must be made. The primary aim of patient satisfaction can be checked by means of the &quot;Oldenburger Inventar&quot; (Oldenburg questionnaire), which determines the improvement of hearing ability in quiet and noise, and of auditory localization. Since the otoplastic substantially effects the amplification of the hearing aid, the ENT specialist should make sure that it does not produce feedback, that it has a second boring, and, in case of need, a Libby horn. He should also consider whether an open fitting would be more appropriate. A free-field measurement--with and without noise--shows whether the dB(opt) has been reached. The in situ measurement and the loudness rating by the Würzburger Hörfeld (Wuerzburg auditory field) are of great help in detecting fitting errors. Additional procedures, such as auditory speech training, lip reading, or technical devices, for instance FM-communication or a light alarm clock, are often employed in elderly patients."

The BAHA gave better sound quality and greater comfort than conventional hearing aids (HAs), but only 1 study has been done in Japan. We implanted BAHAs in 6 hard-of-hearing patients in the last 2 years. One patient suffered skin problems around the abutment and used the BAHA only briefly. Free-field audiometry, the speech discrimination test (SDT), and the speech recognition test (SRT) were conducted in all subjects. They were evaluated either with the HA or BAHA. The SDT and SRT showed better hearing results in quiet for the BAHA than the conventional HA, but there was a minimum difference in SDT and SRT in noise. Subjects assessed the HA and BAHA using questionnaires. Subjects reported that the BAHA offers a number of important advantages, including greater cosmetic acceptability, improved speech intelligibility, and better sound quality."
"16436986","Amplification in the rehabilitation of unilateral deafness: speech in noise and directional hearing effects with bone-anchored hearing and contralateral routing of signal amplification.","OBJECTIVE: Vibromechanical stimulation with a semi-implantable bone conductor (Entific BAHA device) overcomes some of the head-shadow effects in unilateral deafness. What specific rehabilitative benefits are observed when the functional ear exhibits normal hearing versus moderate sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL)?DESIGN: The authors conducted a prospective trial of subjects with unilateral deafness in a tertiary care center.PATIENTS: This study comprised adults with unilateral deafness (pure-tone average [PTA] &gt; 90 dB; Sp.D. &lt; 20%) and either normal monaural hearing (n = 18) or moderate SNHL (PTA = 25-50 dB: Sp.D. &gt; 75%) in the contralateral functional ear (n = 5).INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were fit with contralateral routing of signal (CROS) devices for 1 month and tested before (mastoid) implantation, fitting, and testing with a bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA).OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were: 1) subjective benefit; 2) source localization tests (Source Azimuth Identification in Noise Test [SAINT]); 3) speech discrimination in quiet and in noise assessed with Hearing In Noise Test (HINT) protocols.RESULTS: There was consistent satisfaction with BAHA amplification and poor acceptance of CROS amplification. General directional hearing decreased with CROS use and was unchanged by BAHA and directional microphone aids. Relative to baseline and CROS, BAHA produced significantly better speech recognition in noise. Twenty-two of 23 subjects followed up in this study continue to use their BAHA device over an average follow-up period of 30.24 months (range, 51-12 months).CONCLUSION: BAHA amplification on the side of a deaf ear yields greater benefit in subjects with monaural hearing than does CROS amplification. Advantages likely related to averting the interference of speech signals delivered to the better ear, as occurs with conventional CROS amplification, while alleviating the negative head-shadow effects of unilateral deafness. The advantages of head-shadow reduction in enhancing speech recognition with noise in the hearing ear outweigh disadvantages inherent in head-shadow reduction that can occur by introducing noise from the deaf side. The level of hearing impairment correlates with incremental benefit provided by the BAHA. Patients with a moderate SNHL in the functioning ear perceived greater increments in benefit, especially in background noise, and demonstrated greater improvements in speech understanding with BAHA amplification."
"17849636","Short-term and long-term hearing aid benefit and user satisfaction: a comparison between two fitting protocols.","Currently published hearing aid fitting protocols recommend speech-in-noise testing and loudness measures, but it remains unclear how these measures affect hearing aid benefit and user satisfaction. This study compared two protocols in their effects on benefit and satisfaction. Protocol A included an electroacoustic analysis, real-ear measures, and hearing aid adjustments based on users' comments. Protocol B included all of Protocol A and a speech-in-noise test, loudness discomfort levels, and aided loudness. Thirty-two participants completed the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) and the Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life (SADL) at 45 days and three months post-initial fitting. Fewer hearing aid adjustments were made to the hearing aids for participants fitted with Protocol B than participants fitted with Protocol A, but final gains were similar for both groups. Although similar APHAB scores were obtained for both protocols, SADL scores decreased between 45 days and three months for Protocol A."

On the Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit, hearing aid users indicated more unaided difficulty in easy listening situations and less aided benefit in more difficult listening situations compared to the original study. Subjects who no longer used hearing aids indicated less difficulty in unaided situations. All measures indicated significant long-term subjective benefit and satisfaction with hearing aids.

"17494874","Evidence for the use of hearing assistive technology by adults: the role of the FM system.","Hearing assistive technologies include listening, alerting, and/or signaling devices that use auditory, visual, and/or tactile modalities to augment communication and/or facilitate awareness of environmental sounds. The importance of hearing assistive technologies in the management of adults with hearing loss was recently acknowledged in an evidence-based clinical practice guideline developed by the American Academy of Audiology. Most currently available evidence for hearing assistive technology use by adults focuses on frequency-modulated (FM) technology. Previous research is reviewed that demonstrates the efficacy of FM devices for adults in terms of laboratory measures of speech understanding in noise. Also reviewed are the outcomes from field trials of FM use by community-dwelling adults, which, to date, have been disappointing. Few to no individuals, in previous studies, elected to use FM devices at the end of the trial periods. Data are presented from a 1-group pretest-posttest study examining the role of extensive counseling, coaching, and instruction on FM use by adults. In addition, the potential influence of the cost of devices to the individual was eliminated by conducting the study with veterans who were eligible to receive FM systems through the Veterans Affairs National Hearing Aid Program. Positive outcomes were obtained at the end of a 6-week trial period and were found to remain 1 year after study completion. Implications for increasing the evidence base for the use of FM devices by adults are discussed."
"17344545","The objective and subjective evaluation of multichannel expansion in wide dynamic range compression hearing instruments.","PURPOSE: The effects of multichannel expansion on the objective and subjective evaluation of 20 listeners fitted binaurally with 4-channel, digital in-the-ear hearing instruments were investigated.METHOD: Objective evaluations were conducted in quiet using the Connected Speech Test (CST) and in noise using the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) at 40, 50, and 60 dB SPL. Subjective evaluations were conducted by having each participant (a) rate their satisfaction regarding the amount of noise reduction they perceived daily and (b) indicate which expansion condition they preferred overall after a 2-week trial. Three expansion settings were programmed into the hearing aids: 4-channel expansion, expansion restricted to Channels 1 and 2 only, and expansion off.RESULTS: Listeners performed significantly better in quiet (CST) and in noise (HINT) for the off condition than for either multichannel condition; however, restricting expansion to Channels 1 and 2 improved objective performance in quiet and in noise relative to the 4-channel condition. Conversely, satisfaction ratings were significantly greater for both multichannel conditions than for the off condition; however, satisfaction ratings were similar for the restricted and the 4-channel conditions. Overall, listeners preferred any form of multichannel expansion to no expansion; however, overall preference was similar for the restricted and the 4-channel conditions.CONCLUSIONS: Hearing instrument users prefer the use of multichannel expansion despite the fact multichannel expansion may significantly reduce the recognition of low-level speech in quiet and in noise. Although restricting expansion to Channels 1 and 2 (i.e., 2000 Hz and below) maintained subjective benefit for wide dynamic range compression hearing instrument users, the recognition of low-level speech was not completely preserved."
"19045657","The effect of the base line response on self-adjustments of hearing aid gain.","Self-adjustments of variable hearing aid parameters are essential for trainable hearing aids to provide customized amplification for different listening environments. Prompted by a finding of Dreschler et al. [Ear Hear. 29, 214-227 (2008)], this study investigates the effect of the base line (starting) response on self-adjustments of gain in different frequency bands. In a laboratory test, 24 hearing-impaired listeners adjusted the bass, treble, and overall gain to reach their preferred responses from two different base line responses for 12 different listening situations. The adjustments were repeated five times using the preferred response after each adjustment as base line response for the next adjustment. Half of the listeners further compared three different response shapes, within the range of preferred responses, pairwise ten times for preferential and perceptual discrimination. The results revealed that base line response biases were more pronounced at low frequencies and for listeners with a flat hearing loss configuration. While 83% of listeners reliably discriminated between the average selected biased responses, only 25% demonstrated reliable preferences for one response over the other. Listeners who showed preferential discrimination ability were those who were less biased by the base line response. The clinical implication is that self-adjustments should begin from an appropriately prescribed starting response."
"19034196","Longitudinal benefit from and satisfaction with the Baha system for patients with acquired unilateral sensorineural hearing loss.","OBJECTIVE: To analyze the short-, medium-, and long-term benefits from and satisfaction with the Baha for patients with profound unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).DESIGN: Prospective clinical study.SETTING: Head and Neck Institute at the Cleveland Clinic.PATIENTS: Eight patients with acquired profound unilateral SNHL.INTERVENTIONS: Patients underwent unaided baseline testing and aided Baha testing using laboratory and self-report measures at 6 postfitting intervals.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Laboratory measures included the revised Speech Perception in Noise test, Hearing in Noise Test, and localization testing. Disease-specific self-report measures included the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit, Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults, and Single-Sided Deafness Questionnaire. The Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 Health Survey was used to assess health-related quality of life.RESULTS: Based on 95% confidence intervals for unaided testing, significant improvements on aided revised Speech Perception in Noise, Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit, and Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults scores were sustained during the 18-month test interval. Variable performance was observed for the Hearing in Noise Test over time and patients. No acclimatization effects were shown for localization testing or the generic health-related quality-of-life measure. Patients reported satisfaction in a variety of situations as quantified by the Single-Sided Deafness Questionnaire in the long-term.CONCLUSION: The Baha is effective in reducing psychosocial consequences of unilateral profound SNHL for the long-term. Improvement in speech understanding occurred when the primary signal was spatially separated from background noise. Localization performance did not improve with Baha use. Overall, patients were satisfied with their Baha and would still elect to have this procedure if given a second chance."
"18840704","Long-term usage of modern signal processing by listeners with severe or profound hearing loss: a retrospective survey.","PURPOSE: To investigate the long-term benefit of multichannel wide dynamic range compression (WDRC) alone and in combination with directional microphones and noise reduction/speech enhancement for listeners with severe or profound hearing loss.METHOD: At the conclusion of a research project, 39 participants with severe or profound hearing loss were fitted with WDRC in one program and WDRC with directional microphones and speech enhancement enabled in a 2nd program. More than 2 years after the 1st participants exited the project, a retrospective survey was conducted to determine the participants' use of, and satisfaction with, the 2 programs.RESULTS: From the 30 returned questionnaires, it seems that WDRC is used with a high degree of satisfaction in general everyday listening situations. The reported benefit from the addition of a directional microphone and speech enhancement for listening in noisy environments was lower and varied among the users. This variable was significantly correlated with how much the program was used.CONCLUSIONS: The less frequent and more varied use of the program with directional microphones and speech enhancement activated in combination suggests that these features may be best offered in a 2nd listening program for listeners with severe or profound hearing loss."
"18795473","Recording and classification of the acoustic environment of hearing aid users.","This article investigates the different acoustic signals that hearing aid users are exposed to in their everyday environment. Binaural microphone signals from recording positions close to the microphone locations of behind-the-ear hearing aids were recorded by 20 hearing aid users during daily life. The recorded signals were acoustically analyzed with regard to narrowband short-term level distributions. The subjects also performed subjective assessments of their own recordings in the laboratory using several questions from the Glasgow Hearing Aid Benefit Profile (GHABP) questionnaire. Both the questionnaire and the acoustic analysis data show that the importance, problems, and hearing aid benefit as well as the acoustic characteristics of the individual situations vary a lot across subjects. Therefore, in addition to a nonlinear hearing aid fitting, further signal classification and signal/situation-adaptive features are highly desirable inside modern hearing aids. These should be compatible with the variability of the individual sound environments of hearing-impaired listeners."
"18698521","Digital noise reduction: outcomes from laboratory and field studies.","The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of a digital noise reduction (DNR) scheme implemented in a current commercial hearing aid. In a double-blinded design, three conditions of onset time (4, 8, 16 seconds) were randomly assigned to the 25 subjects, plus one condition wherein the noise-reduction feature was disengaged. Subsequently, a fifth trial/condition, wherein the subject had access to three memories in which the different onsets were programmed, was carried out. For each of the five conditions, the subjects had an at-home trial, prior to obtaining self-report measures. Laboratory measures of speech perception showed no effect of the DNR, with or without the provision of visual cues. Laboratory-based ratings of ease of listening showed DNR-on (all onset times) to be rated significantly better than DNR-off; for ratings of listening comfort, the 4-second onset time was rated significantly lower (poorer) than the 8-second onset or the DNR-off condition; for ratings of sound quality, DNR-on or -off had no differential effect. Self-report measures indicated significantly higher aversiveness in the DNR-off condition compared to the pre-test scores."
"18664691","Candidacy for bilateral hearing aids: a retrospective multicenter study.","PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to find factors for refining candidacy criteria for bilateral hearing aid fittings. Clinical files of 1,000 consecutive hearing aid fittings were analyzed.METHOD: Case history, audiometric, and rehabilitation data were collected from clinical files, and an extensive questionnaire on long-term outcome measures was conducted. After at least 2 years of hearing aid use, 505 questionnaires were returned. In order to compare differences in benefits between unilateral and bilateral fittings, two subgroups were composed in which most relevant variables (age, degree of hearing loss, and audiometric asymmetry) were matched for unilateral fittings (n=212) and bilateral fittings (n=477).RESULTS: The bilateral group had significantly higher benefit scores than the unilateral group for detection, speech intelligibility in reverberation, and localization, but poorer scores for comfort of loud sounds. The benefit of bilateral hearing aids was not significantly related to the level of technology of the hearing aids.CONCLUSION: The analysis of the relation between objective parameters and the subjective outcome measures showed that candidacy for a successful bilateral fitting could not be predicted from age, maximum speech intelligibility, employment, exposure to background noise, or social activities."
"18561116","Treatment of tinnitus with a customized acoustic neural stimulus: a controlled clinical study.","In patients with tinnitus, achieving consistently positive treatment results is a challenge. We conducted a controlled clinical study of a new treatment approach (Neuromonics Tinnitus Treatment) that involves the use of a customized neural stimulus. This stimulus is delivered to the patient in the form of a pleasant acoustic sensation that is spectrally modified according to each patient's individual audiometric profile. This treatment approach is provided as part of a structured rehabilitation program. In our study, patients who received the customized stimulus (Neuromonics group) reported significantly greater and more consistent alleviation of tinnitus symptoms than did patients who participated in a counseling and support program with and without delivery of a broadband noise stimulus (Noise+Counseling group and Counseling-Only group, respectively). After 6 months of treatment, 86% of the Neuromonics patients met the minimum criterion for clinical success, defined as an alleviation of tinnitus disturbance of at least 40% (as determined by the Tinnitus Reaction Questionnaire score). By contrast, only 47 and 23% of the Noise+Counseling and Counseling-Only groups, respectively, reported a successful result according to this criterion. Mean improvements in tinnitus disturbance scores in the Neuromonics, Noise+Counseling, and Counseling-Only groups were 66, 22, and 15%, respectively. The differences between the Neuromonics group and the control groups were statistically significant. Significant differences were observed in other clinical outcomes. Patient reports of user acceptability were more consistently positive in the Neuromonics group."
"18365229","A comparative study of the audiological outcomes with Retro-X (semi-implantable hearing aid system) and conventional open fitting hearing aids.","The objective of this study was to compare the results of hearing augmentation with the Retro-X semi-implantable hearing aid to a conventional non-implantable open canal hearing aid using the same software technology (Titan-X, auric Hearing Systems, HiKaNo.:13.20.03.0047). Nineteen subjects (20 ears) with mild to moderate high-frequency sensory-neural hearing loss were included in this clinical study. All the subjects were first fitted with a conventional open canal hearing aid (Titan-X). After a period of 4-6 weeks audiological evaluations were performed using standardized speech tests in quiet and noise. Subjective evaluation was performed with the help of standardized questionnaires. After this phase the patients received the semi-implantable Retro-X device under local anaesthesia and 4 weeks later were fitted with a hearing module with the same software technology as the conventional Titan-X hearing aid. Four weeks following the first fitting the same audiological evaluations were performed under similar conditions and the patients were evaluated again using the same questionnaires in order to compare the results of the Retro-X semi-implantable system with the conventional open canal hearing aid. Audiological evaluations revealed better results with the semi-implantable Retro-X in the adaptive speech in noise test; however, the results of the monosyllabic word test in quiet were similar for the Retro-X and conventional open canal hearing aid. The patients subjectively preferred the improved wearing comfort of the semi-implantable device. The Retro-X semi-implantable hearing aid provides better speech perception in noise and higher wearing comfort in comparison to the conventional open canal hearing aids. Considering the simple implantation procedure under local anaesthesia with low complication rate, Retro-X is an alternative to the conventional open canal hearing aids in patients with mild to moderate high frequency sensory-neural hearing loss."
"18326151","The objective and subjective evaluation of low-frequency expansion in wide dynamic range compression hearing instruments.","The effects of low-frequency expansion on the objective and subjective evaluation of four channel in-the-ear hearing instruments was investigated. Three expansion settings were programmed in each device: expansion off, expansion restricted to channel one, and expansion restricted to channels one and two. Objective evaluations were conducted in quiet (Connected Speech Test) and in noise (Hearing in Noise Test) with speech levels fixed at 40 dB SPL. Subjectively, each participant rated expansion satisfaction in quiet and listening to low-level speech in a sound-treated room then indicated the expansion condition preferred overall. Listeners performed significantly better in quiet and in noise for the Off and Channel 1 conditions than the Channels 1 and 2 condition; however, performance was similar between the Off and Channel 1 conditions. Expansion effects on listener satisfaction ratings depended on the listening environment. Overall, listeners preferred expansion in Channel 1 to expansion in Channels 1 and 2; however, preference was not significantly different between the Channel 1 and Off conditions. Results indicate restricting expansion to 1000 Hz overcomes speech-recognition deficits observed with expansion active across a broader spectrum without significantly reducing subjective benefit or preference."
"18230861","Relationship between acceptable noise level and the abbreviated profile of hearing aid benefit.","PURPOSE: This study investigated the relationship between acceptable noise levels (ANLs) and the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB; R. M. Cox &amp; G. C. Alexander, 1995). This study further examined the APHAB's ability to predict hearing aid use.METHOD: ANL and APHAB data were collected for 191 listeners with impaired hearing, separated into 3 groups based on hearing aid use: full-time, part-time, or nonuse.RESULTS: Results demonstrated ANLs were not correlated with APHAB scores. Results further demonstrated 2 of the 4 APHAB subscales (Ease of Communication [EC] and Background Noise [BN]) predicted hearing aid success with 60% accuracy, which is 25% poorer than that observed using the ANL alone. When combining the ANL with the EC and BN subscales, accuracy of the prediction increased to 91%. Lastly, 3 of the 4 APHAB subscales (EC, BN, and Reverberation) enhanced the present prediction of hearing aid use for patients with mid-range ANLs.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that ANLs and APHAB scores provide unique information regarding hearing aid use. These results further indicate that the prediction can be enhanced by administering both the ANL and the EC and BN APHAB subscales. Lastly, some of the ambiguity of the prediction of hearing aid use for listeners with mid-range ANLs may be eliminated."
"18230860","Acceptance of noise growth patterns in hearing aid users.","PURPOSE: To examine whether the effects of speech presentation level on acceptance of noise could differentiate full-time, part-time, and nonusers of hearing aids and whether these effects could predict hearing aid use.METHOD: Participants were separated into 3 groups on the basis of hearing aid use: (a) full-time use, (b) part-time use, or (c) nonuse. Acceptable noise levels (ANLs) were measured conventionally and at 8 fixed presentation levels. The effects of presentation level on ANL were determined by calculating global ANL (ANL averaged across presentation level) and ANL growth (slope of the ANL function).RESULTS: Global ANLs were smaller for full-time users than for part-time users and nonusers; however, global ANLs were not different for part-time users and nonusers. ANL growth differentiated full-time users from nonusers only. Conventional ANL predicted hearing aid use with 68% accuracy. Compared with conventional ANL, the accuracy of the prediction for global ANL and ANL growth decreased, and the accuracy of the prediction at presentation levels of 65 to 75 dB HL was maintained.CONCLUSIONS: Global ANL differentiated the hearing aid groups in the same manner as conventional ANL. The effects of presentation level on acceptance of noise did not considerably increase the accuracy of the prediction compared with conventional ANL. Clinical applications are discussed."
"20017682","Environmental noise reduction configuration: Effects on preferences, satisfaction, and speech understanding.","The effects of four configurations of an environmental noise reduction (ENR) algorithm on preferences, speech understanding, and satisfaction were investigated. The gain reduction at 0 dB modulation depth was either 10 dB in all channels (ENR StrongFlat) or shaped from 2-10 dB across channels according to a speech importance function (ENR MildSII). This gain reduction was either invariant (ENR Constant) or varied with (ENR Variable) the noise level. Ten hearing-impaired participants blindly compared pairs of configurations in real-world situations and recorded their preferences. Sentence reception thresholds (SRTs) were measured in quiet and noise, and satisfaction was rated with speech in noise. Half of the participants preferred ENR MildSII and half preferred ENR StrongFlat. All preferred ENR Variable to ENR Constant. Overall, the preferred ENR configuration was preferred to ENR off in 90% of responses. No statistically significant effect on SRTs was found, but a clinically significant effect of up to 2 dB could not be ruled out from the available data. ENR significantly improved satisfaction for listening comfort, ease of speech understanding, and sound quality."
"19904546","Pilot study on the effectiveness of the conventional CROS, the transcranial CROS and the BAHA transcranial CROS in adults with unilateral inner ear deafness.","The objective of the present pilot study is to evaluate the effectiveness of three conventional contralateral routing of sound (CROS) hearing aids in adults with unilateral inner ear deafness. The study included tertiary referral center. Ten patients with unilateral inner ear deafness and normal hearing in the contralateral ear were selected to evaluate three different methods of amplification: the CROS hearing aid, the completely in the canal hearing aid and the bone-anchored hearing aid CROS (BAHA). Each of the three hearing aids was tried in a random order for a period of 8 weeks. Audiometric performance, including speech-in-noise, directional hearing and subjective benefit were measured after each trial period, using the APHAB, SSQ and single-sided deafness questionnaire. Sound localization performance was essentially at chance level in all four conditions. Mixed results were seen on the other patient outcome measures that alternated in favor of one of the three CROS devices. After the trial, three patients chose to be fitted with the BAHA CROS and one with the conventional CROS. In conclusion, most of the patients experienced some degree of benefit with each of the three hearing aids. Preference for one of the three hearing aids was independent of the order in which they were tried. It would be worthwhile to formulate selection criteria; still, we recommend that all patients with unilateral inner ear deafness should be offered a trial with at least the BAHA CROS."
"19882494","Real-world benefit from directional microphone hearing aids.","This article summarizes data from a 3-year, double-blinded study of directional hearing aid benefit. Ninety-four subjects in three hearing loss groups, all previous users of omnidirectional output-compression hearing aids, completed all aspects of the study. Participants were fit with new hearing aids for 1 month in a directional mode and 1 month in an omnidirectional mode. Following 1 month of use, subjects completed a number of objective and subjective measures of hearing aid outcome. Objective and subjective data were analyzed across hearing aid and hearing loss conditions. Subjects in all hearing loss groups exhibited better performance in the directional conditions for objective speech-in-noise measures; however, subjective data did not indicate a clear advantage for directional amplification. Results and clinical implications are discussed."
"19816229","Preliminary evaluation of a novel bone-conduction device for single-sided deafness.","HYPOTHESIS: A new intraoral bone-conduction device has advantages over existing bone-conduction devices for reducing the auditory deficits associated with single-sided deafness (SSD).BACKGROUND: Existing bone-conduction devices effectively mitigate auditory deficits from single-sided deafness but have suboptimal microphone locations, limited frequency range, and/or require invasive surgery. A new device has been designed to improve microphone placement (in the ear canal of the deaf ear), provide a wider frequency range, and eliminate surgery by delivering bone-conduction signals to the teeth via a removable oral appliance.METHODS: Forces applied by the oral appliance were compared with forces typically experienced by the teeth from normal functions such as mastication or from other appliances. Tooth surface changes were measured on extracted teeth, and transducer temperature was measured under typical use conditions. Dynamic operating range, including gain, bandwidth, and maximum output limits, were determined from uncomfortable loudness levels and vibrotactile thresholds, and speech recognition scores were measured using normal-hearing subjects. Auditory performance in noise (Hearing in Noise Test) was measured in a limited sample of SSD subjects. Overall comfort, ease of insertion, and removal and visibility of the oral appliance in comparison with traditional hearing aids were measured using a rating scale.RESULTS: The oral appliance produces forces that are far below those experienced by the teeth from normal functions or conventional dental appliances. The bone-conduction signal level can be adjusted to prevent tactile perception yet provide sufficient gain and output at frequencies from 250 to 12,000 Hz. The device does not damage tooth surfaces nor produce heat, can be inserted and removed easily, and is as comfortable to wear as traditional hearing aids. The new microphone location has advantages for reducing the auditory deficits caused by SSD, including the potential to provide spatial cues introduced by reflections from the pinna, compared with microphone locations for existing devices.CONCLUSION: A new approach for SSD has been proposed that optimizes microphone location and delivers sound by bone conduction through a removable oral appliance. Measures in the laboratory using normal-hearing subjects indicate that the device provides useful gain and output for SSD patients, is comfortable, does not seem to have detrimental effects on oral function or oral health, and has several advantages over existing devices. Specifically, microphone placement is optimized for reducing the auditory deficit caused by SSD, frequency bandwidth is much greater, and the system does not require surgical placement. Auditory performance in a small sample of SSD subjects indicated a substantial advantage compared with not wearing the device. Future studies will involve performance measures on SSD patients wearing the device for longer periods."
"19692903","Development of APHAB norms for WDRC hearing aids and comparisons with original norms.","OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken for two purposes: First, to provide a comparison of subjective performance and benefit measured with the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) questionnaire for two groups. One group included hearing-impaired individuals using 1990s-era linear processing hearing aids. The other group included hearing-impaired individuals using more current wide-dynamic range compression (WDRC)-capable hearing aids fit using current practice protocols. The second purpose of this study was to determine whether APHAB norms derived from scores for current hearing aid users were different from the original 1995 norms. It was hypothesized that technology improvements would result in improved subjective performance for modern hearing aid wearers.DESIGN: A systematic sampling method was used to identify and recruit subjects from seven private-practice audiology clinics located across the United States. Potential subjects were limited to older hearing-impaired individuals who were wearing hearing aids capable of WDRC processing. One hundred fifty-four subjects returned completed APHAB questionnaires. Participants reported mostly moderate to moderately severe subjective hearing difficulty.RESULTS: No differences in perceived difficulty with speech communication were observed between the two groups. However, aversiveness of amplified sound was less frequently reported for users of WDRC-capable hearing aids. Norms were generated using data from all of the operationally defined successful hearing aid users in the sample and compared with the original 1995 norms. Differences between the 1995 and 2005 norms were minimal for the speech communication subscales. However, the 2005 group consistently reported less frequent difficulties with sound aversiveness (AV subscale) in the aided condition. In addition to these findings, an improvement was observed in the rate of successful adjustment to hearing aids between 1995 (43%) and 2005 (82%).CONCLUSIONS: Overall, problems understanding amplified speech did not decrease in frequency when hearing aids transitioned from linear to compression processing; however, the compression capabilities of current hearing aids (with a possible contribution from noise reduction algorithms) have resulted in less negative reactions to amplified environmental sounds. This suggests that modern technology has ameliorated (to some extent) the common complaint that hearing aids cause many everyday sounds to become objectionably loud. Although the results of this study suggest that the advantages of improved technology do not lie in the domains of improved subjective speech communication performance, substantial improvement in the rate of successful adjustment to hearing aids between the 1995 and 2005 subject groups provides evidence that modern hearing aid technology has produced progress in other outcome domains."
"19418710","Evaluation of a &quot;direct-comparison&quot; approach to automatic switching in omnidirectional/directional hearing aids.","BACKGROUND: Hearing aids today often provide both directional (DIR) and omnidirectional (OMNI) processing options with the currently active mode selected automatically by the device. The most common approach to automatic switching involves &quot;acoustic scene analysis&quot; where estimates of various acoustic properties of the listening environment (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio [SNR], overall sound level) are used as a basis for switching decisions.PURPOSE: The current study was carried out to evaluate an alternative, &quot;direct-comparison&quot; approach to automatic switching that does not involve assumptions about how the listening environment may relate to microphone preferences. Predictions of microphone preference were based on whether DIR- or OMNI-processing of a given listening environment produced a closer match to a reference template representing the spectral and temporal modulations present in clean speech.RESEARCH DESIGN: A descriptive and correlational study. Predictions of OMNI/DIR preferences were determined based on degree of similarity between spectral and temporal modulations contained in a reference, clean-speech template, and in OMNI- and DIR-processed recordings of various listening environments. These predictions were compared with actual preference judgments (both real-world judgments and laboratory responses to the recordings).DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Predictions of microphone preference were based on whether DIR- or OMNI-processing of a given listening environment produced a closer match to a reference template representing clean speech. The template is the output of an auditory processing model that characterizes the spectral and temporal modulations associated with a given input signal (clean speech in this case). A modified version of the spectro-temporal modulation index (mSTMI) was used to compare the template to both DIR- and OMNI-processed versions of a given listening environment, as processed through the same auditory model. These analyses were carried out on recordings (originally collected by Walden et al, 2007) of OMNI- and DIR-processed speech produced in a range of everyday listening situations. Walden et al reported OMNI/DIR preference judgments made by raters at the same time the field recordings were made and judgments based on laboratory presentations of these recordings to hearing-impaired and normal-hearing listeners. Preference predictions based on the mSTMI analyses were compared with both sets of preference judgments.RESULTS: The mSTMI analyses showed better than 92% accuracy in predicting the field preferences and 82-85% accuracy in predicting the laboratory preference judgments. OMNI processing tended to be favored over DIR processing in cases where the analysis indicated fairly similar mSTMI scores across the two processing modes. This is consistent with the common clinical assignment of OMNI mode as the default setting, most likely to be preferred in cases where neither mode produces a substantial improvement in SNR. Listeners experienced with switchable OMNI/DIR hearing aids were more likely than other listeners to favor the DIR mode in instances where mSTMI scores only slightly favored DIR processing.CONCLUSIONS: A direct-comparison approach to OMNI/DIR mode selection was generally successful in predicting user preferences in a range of listening environments. Future modifications to the approach to further improve predictive accuracy are discussed."
"19266579","Efficacy of the bone-anchored hearing aid for single-sided deafness.","HYPOTHESIS: The aim was to examine short- and long-term efficacy of the bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) on adults with single-sided deafness.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective investigation.METHODS: The outcome measures included the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT), Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB), and Single-Sided Deafness Questionnaire (SSD). The BAHA group comprised seven adults with single-sided deafness and the control group comprised 20 adults with essentially normal-hearing sensitivity, bilaterally. The outcome measures were administered in the unaided, directional BAHA, and omnidirectional BAHA conditions after 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months of BAHA use. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) model was used to evaluate the data (for the SSD, a nonparametric analog of ANOVA was employed).RESULTS: None of the factors (time, HINT condition, amplification status) or their interactions were significant predictors of change in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from baseline over time on the HINT. The mean SNR (non-baseline-subtracted) was significantly lower in the directional BAHA versus the unaided status and in the omnidirectional BAHA versus the unaided status, but only under the noise in front, speech lateralized to the bad ear HINT condition. Significant short- and long-term BAHA benefit was observed on the APHAB (all subscales except Aversiveness) and SSD (all questionnaire items).CONCLUSIONS: Our results show short- and long-term efficacy for the BAHA in adults with single-sided deafness for recognition of speech in noise (noise in front, speech lateralized to the bad ear) and on subjective measures of benefit."
"19194292","Spatial benefit of bilateral hearing AIDS.","OBJECTIVES: To assess the extent to which hearing aids improve spatial benefit by restoring the availability of interaural difference cues, the benefit attributable to spatial separation of speech and babble with and without bilateral hearing aids was measured as a function of low-pass cutoff frequency.DESIGN: Twenty-one older adults with sloping high-frequency hearing loss were provided commercially available bilateral hearing aids. After a 3 to 6 month acclimatization period, speech levels corresponding to 50% correct recognition of sentences from the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) were measured in a 65-dB SPL babble, with speech and babble low-pass filtered at 1.8, 3.6, and 5.6 kHz. Sentences were always at 0 degrees azimuth, and babble was at either 0 degrees or 90 degrees . Speech and babble spectra for all conditions were digitally recorded using a probe microphone placed in each ear canal of each subject. Spectra and levels of speech and babble and unaided thresholds for narrowband noises were used to calculate the aided audibility index and provide predictions of unaided and aided thresholds for HINT sentences, hearing aid benefit, and spatial benefit for each cutoff frequency. In addition, subjects' willingness to tolerate background noise with and without amplification was measured in the spatially coincident and spatially separated conditions using the Acceptable Noise Level (ANL) procedure.RESULTS: Thresholds for HINT sentences in babble and ANL improved significantly when aided and when speech and babble were spatially separated. Specifically, hearing aid benefit improved significantly as cutoff frequency increased from 1.8 to 3.6 kHz but only when speech and babble were spatially separated; likewise, spatial benefit improved significantly from 1.8 to 3.6 kHz but only in the aided condition. No further improvement in hearing aid or spatial benefit was observed when cutoff frequency was increased from 3.6 to 5.6 kHz, although improvement in hearing aid benefit was predicted.CONCLUSIONS: Hearing aid benefit, although significant, was poorer than predicted, suggesting that these older adults with high-frequency hearing loss did not take full advantage of the increase in audible speech information provided by amplification. Hearing aid benefit was also limited because hearing aids for some subjects did not restore speech audibility across the full bandwidth of speech. Unaided and aided spatial benefit was significantly greater than predicted, and aided spatial benefit was greater than unaided. This suggests that these older adults were able to take advantage of interaural level and time difference cues to improve speech recognition in babble and that they benefited from these cues to a greater extent with than without bilateral hearing aids. Finally, in contrast to results of previous studies, ANL may vary for an individual depending on the listening condition."

"20807482","Effects of acoustical stimuli delivered through hearing aids on tinnitus.","BACKGROUND: The use of acoustic signals to mask, mix with, or ease the distress associated with tinnitus has been clinically employed for decades. It has been proposed that expanding acoustic options for tinnitus sufferers due to personal preferences is desirable. Fractal tones incorporate many useful characteristics of music while avoiding certain features that could be distracting to some individuals.PURPOSE: To assess the effects on relaxation, tinnitus annoyance, tinnitus handicap, and tinnitus reaction from the use of a hearing aid that incorporates combinations of amplification, fractal tones, and white noise.RESEARCH DESIGN: Participants listened to experimental hearing aids containing several acoustic options and were asked to rate the signals in terms of their effect on relaxation and tinnitus annoyance. They subsequently wore the hearing aids for 6 mo and completed tinnitus handicap and reaction scales.STUDY SAMPLE: Fourteen hearing-impaired adults with primary complaints of subjective tinnitus.INTERVENTION: Participants were tested wearing hearing aids containing several programs including amplification only, fractal tones only, and a combination of amplification, noise, and/or fractal tones. The fractal tones (now commercially available as the &quot;Zen&quot; feature) were generated by the Widex Mind hearing aid. Rating procedures were conducted in the laboratory, and tinnitus reaction and handicap were assessed during and following a 6 mo field trial.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were collected at the initial visit, one week, 1 mo, 3 mo, and 6 mo. Nonparametric statistics included Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank, chi(2), and repeated-measures analyses of variance.RESULTS: Thirteen of 14 participants reported that their tinnitus annoyance, as measured by the Tinnitus Annoyance Scale, was reduced for at least one of the amplified conditions (with or without fractal tones or noise), relative to the unaided condition. Nine assigned a lower tinnitus annoyance rating when listening to fractal tones alone versus the amplification-alone condition. There was a range of preferences observed for fractal settings, with most participants preferring fractals with a slow or medium tempo and restricted dynamic range. The majority (86%) indicated that it was easier to relax while listening to fractal signals. Participants had preferences for certain programs and fractal characteristics. Although seven participants rated the noise-only condition as providing the least tinnitus annoyance, only two opted to have noise only as a program during the field trial, and none selected the noise-only condition as the preferred setting. Furthermore, while all four of the experienced hearing aid users selected noise as producing the least annoying tinnitus in the laboratory, only one selected it for field wear. Tinnitus Handicap Inventory and Tinnitus Reaction Questionnaire scores were improved over the course of the 6 mo trial, with clinically significant improvements occurring for over half of the participants on at least one of the measures.CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that use of acoustic stimuli, particularly fractal tones, delivered though hearing aids can provide amplification while allowing for relief for some tinnitus sufferers. It is important to recognize, however, that tinnitus management procedures need to be supplemented with appropriate counseling."
"20738337","The bone-anchored hearing aid in the rehabilitation of single-sided deafness: experience with 58 patients.","OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of the bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) in the rehabilitation of single-sided deafness (SSD).STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case-control series review.SETTING: Tertiary referral unit.PATIENTS: Fifty-eight consecutive patients that had a bone-anchored hearing aid for single-sided deafness completed outcome questionnaires, building upon earlier audiological assessment of 19 patients. Single-sided deafness controls (n = 49) were mainly acoustic neuroma patients.MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: speech discrimination testing in directional noise, speech and spatial qualities of hearing questionnaire and the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI).RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 28.4 months. Five (13%) of the bone-anchored hearing aid patients were non-users because of lack of benefit. The audiometric testing confirmed that when noise was on the bone-anchored hearing aid side speech perception was reduced but benefited when noise was on the side of the hearing ear. There was no difference between the Speech and Spatial Qualities of Hearing Scores in bone-anchored hearing aid users and controls. In particular there was no difference in the spatial subscores. In the bone-anchored hearing aid users the median Glasgow Benefit Inventory score was 11. If the non-users are included then 13 (22%) patients had no or detrimental (negative) Benefit scores. No or negative benefit scores were more frequent in those deaf for &lt;10 years. In open-field questions, patients felt the bone-anchored hearing aid was most useful in small groups or in 'one-to-one' conversation.CONCLUSIONS: Bone-anchored hearing aid rehabilitation for single-sided deafness is less successful than for other indications, reflected here by relatively low median Glasgow Benefit Inventory scores. There was also no significant difference between controls and bone-anchored hearing aid users in the Speech and Spatial Qualities of Hearing Questionnaire. Patients with a longer duration of deafness report greater subjective benefit than those more recently deafened, perhaps due to differing expectations."
"20734965","Bone-anchored hearing aids in patients with acquired and congenital unilateral inner ear deafness (Baha CROS): clinical evaluation of 56 cases.","OBJECTIVES: We performed an evaluation of the audiological and subjective benefits of the bone-anchored hearing aid (Baha) as a device for transcranial routing of sound (Baha CROS) in 56 patients with unilateral inner ear deafness.METHODS: We performed a prospective clinical follow-up study in a tertiary referral center. Previously reported results of 29 patients were supplemented with a second series of 30 patients with unilateral inner ear deafness; 3 patients dropped out during the evaluation. Audiometric measurements were taken before and after Baha CROS fitting. Subjective benefits were quantified with 4 different patient questionnaires.RESULTS: The sound localization results in a well-structured test setting were not differentiable from chance. The 5 patients with congenital hearing loss showed better scores in the unaided sound localization measurements. Overall, most patients reported some subjective improvement in their capacity to localize sounds with the Baha CROS in daily life. The main effect of the Baha CROS was to alleviate the head shadow effect during the speech-in-noise test.CONCLUSIONS: Poor sound localization in this larger series of patients confirms the findings of previous studies. Improvements in the speech-in-noise scores corroborated the efficacy of the Baha CROS in alleviating the head shadow effect. The 4 different patient questionnaires revealed subjective benefit and satisfaction in various domains."
"20304277","The Baha system in patients with single-sided deafness and contralateral hearing loss.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the Baha system in cases of single-sided deafness (SSD) and mild to moderate hearing loss in the better-hearing ear.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective trial.SETTING: Tertiary otologic referral center.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with SSD and mild to moderate hearing loss in the contralateral ear implanted with the Baha system between June 2006 and March 2008 were evaluated following Baha implantation and fitting with the Divino and Intenso processors. Pure-tone air and bone conduction thresholds, sound-field testing (aided and unaided in quiet and noise) of consonant nucleus consonant words (Northwestern University Auditory Test No. 6 words), and Hearing in Noise Test sentences were obtained. Patient satisfaction questionnaires were administered pre- and post-intervention for either device.RESULTS: Patients with SSD and mild to moderate hearing loss in the contralateral ear showed a statistically significant improvement in all measures with the use of the Divino or Intenso processors compared with the unaided situation. Change in hearing, as measured in noise testing word recognition scores, revealed a statistically significant difference between the two aided conditions favoring the Intenso (P &lt; 0.05). The Glasgow Benefit Inventory revealed that 91 percent of the patients reported improvement in their quality of life and would recommend the procedure to others.CONCLUSION: The Baha system is effective in the rehabilitation of patients with SSD and mild to moderate hearing loss in the only hearing ear. Results of the current study suggest that either the Divino or Intenso processor was successful in reestablishing hearing from the deafened side."
"20131363","Bone-anchored hearing aid subjective benefit for unilateral deafness.","HYPOTHESIS: Determine the benefit of the bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) in patients with unilateral deafness.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series and prospective questionnaire study at a tertiary referral center.METHODS: Patients with unilateral deafness of various etiologies who were implanted with a BAHA (n = 126) or not implanted with a BAHA after a translabyrinthine craniotomy (n = 126) were mailed questionnaires. A total of 139 patients (55%) responded to the questionnaires. Patients who were implanted with a BAHA received a general questionnaire concerning BAHA usage, the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB), and the Speech, Spatial, and Qualities of Hearing Questionnaire (SSQ). Patients not implanted with a BAHA received only the SSQ hearing questionnaire.RESULTS: Patients with unilateral deafness demonstrated a benefit with BAHA use on the APHAB. Most improvement with the BAHA was seen in the Background Noise subscale, with a 17.4% improvement. Ease of Communication and Reverberation subscales also demonstrated an 11.6% and 13.2% benefit, respectively. Patients with a BAHA demonstrated better scores in the SSQ Speech subscale when compared to unilaterally deaf patients who did not have a BAHA, although this difference was not significant.CONCLUSIONS: The APHAB demonstrated significant benefit with the use of a BAHA in patients with unilateral deafness. Although the SSQ speech subscale showed overall improvement in auditory disability with the use of a BAHA, this difference was not significant. However, the SSQ hearing questionnaire demonstrated specific situations were the BAHA is most useful."
"20127102","Advantages of a non-linear frequency compression algorithm in noise.","A multichannel non-linear frequency compression algorithm was evaluated in comparison to conventional amplification hearing aids using a test of speech understanding in noise (Oldenburger Satztest-OLSA) and subjective questionnaires. The new algorithm compresses frequencies above a pre-calculated cut off frequency and shifts them to a lower frequency range, thereby providing high-frequency audibility. Low-frequencies, below the compression cut off frequency, are amplified normally. This algorithm is called SoundRecover (SR). In this study, 11 experienced hearing aid users with a severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss were tested. Seven subjects showed enhanced levels of understanding in noise (OLSA) using frequency compression. However, 4 out of the 11 subjects could not benefit from the high-frequency gain. Evaluation using questionnaires demonstrated an increased level of satisfaction after 2 months of experimental devices wearing (p = 0.08) and after 4 months of wearing (p = 0.09), respectively, compared to conventional hearing instruments."
"20053153","A multi-site evaluation of a proposed test for verifying hearing aid maximum output.","The aim of this study was to evaluate a clinical test proposed to verify the output setting of hearing aids. Across three test sites, 56 bilaterally fitted hearing aid users were recruited. They answered questions about real-life loudness discomfort experiences and then completed the output verification test. Using an ascending method, a 1,500 kHz narrowband noise and a selection of broadband environmental noises were presented in 5 dB steps from 80 to 90 dB SPL. Response options included 'acceptably loud', and 'uncomfortably loud'. A swept pure tone presented at 90 dB SPL was also administered. Some loudness discomfort was reportedly experienced in real life by 82% of the participants. Generally, the test noises produced low specificity, with the 1,500 kHz narrowband noise being the best predictor of loudness discomfort experiences in real life, while the swept pure tone showed low sensitivity. Individual reactions to specific sounds and the test equipment and environment used are argued to affect the laboratory performance. A better understanding of these factors is needed before the test can be improved. an ser mejoradas."
"21916792","Comparison of two bone anchored hearing instruments: BP100 and Ponto Pro.","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at investigating if there were differences in auditory performance, operation, or user preference between the Ponto Pro or the BP100, two bone anchored hearing instruments (BAHI) with modern sound processing technology.DESIGN: Subjects wore the devices in daily life in a crossover study for periods ranging from 25 to 63 days. A speech-in-noise test was carried out as well as measures of noise reduction and feedback suppression algorithms. User satisfaction was reported using the NSH and the GHABP questionnaires. At the end of the test, subjects selected one of the devices for permanent use.STUDY SAMPLE: Twelve first-time users of BAHIs.RESULTS: Eight subjects selected the Ponto Pro; four selected the BP100. The Ponto Pro was rated as easier to operate than the BP100, the visual appearance of the Ponto Pro was rated as nicer than that of the BP100, and speech understanding was rated higher with the Ponto Pro than with the BP100. Speech-in-noise tests showed improvements using directional microphones with the Ponto Pro.CONCLUSIONS: 67% of the subjects opted for permanent use of the Ponto Pro, which, compared to the BP100, was rated to have a nicer look, to be easier to operate, and to yield better speech intelligibility."
"21864473","Hearing aids in the real world: use of multimemory and volume controls.","BACKGROUND: Despite advances in technology, hearing aid users continue to express a desire for some control over their devices. Access to a suitable control can significantly affect overall satisfaction with amplification, yet little is known about the circumstances that drive hearing aid users to manipulate controls. Such information would be useful in guiding clinical decisions about the selection of controls and synchronization of their operation in a bilateral pair of hearing aids.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the real-world use of multimemory (MM) and volume (VC) controls and environmental characteristics that may influence their use.RESEARCH DESIGN: Real-time data about MM and VC usage were gathered in the real world. Subjective reports of the environmental characteristics were obtained. This design allowed examination of the nature of hearing aid adjustments as well as exploration of factors affecting them.STUDY SAMPLE: Ten adults with bilaterally symmetric, mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss participated in the study. All had previous experience with hearing aids.INTERVENTION: Participants were fitted bilaterally with BTE (behind-the-ear) hearing aids equipped with an MM button and/or VC wheel. The devices were connected to a PDA (personal digital assistant) that logged data from the hearing aids and stored surveys completed by participants in various listening situations.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The following data were obtained from the PDA: (1) MM and VC settings in the left and right devices, (2) broadband input level at the microphone of the left and right devices, and (3) participant reports of the presence, distance, and location of signal and background noise. Prevalence of nondefault settings and bilateral symmetry of hearing aid adjustments were summarized descriptively, while the influence of environmental characteristics on hearing aid adjustments was analyzed using nonparametric methods.RESULTS: Over 4-5 wk, 912 hr of data were logged and 184 surveys completed. Results showed that (1) the default (i.e., the programmed or &quot;use&quot;) setting was preferred most often, (2) the preferred hearing aid settings were mostly bilaterally symmetrical, and (3) nondefault settings were often used in difficult listening situations.CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study generally support the use of synchronized MMs and/or VCs, although there may be exceptions to their utility."
"21799455","Long-term safety and benefit of a new intraoral device for single-sided deafness.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the long-term safety and benefit of a new intraoral bone conduction device (SoundBite Hearing System by Sonitus Medical) for single-sided deafness (SSD).STUDY DESIGN: A multi-center, controlled, nonrandomized, prospective unblinded study of SSD patients wearing the device over a 6-month period.SETTINGS: Ambulatory care centers typical of those where SSD patients are diagnosed and treated.PATIENTS: Adults (N = 22) with acquired, permanent SSD and no current use of any other SSD device.INTERVENTION: Continual daily wear of the new device for 6 months.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comprehensive medical, audiologic, and dental measures; aided thresholds; Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit scores, and an SSD questionnaire.RESULTS: There were no related adverse events or changes in the medical or audiologic findings at the end of the trial compared with the beginning. There were no significant changes in the mean aided thresholds (p &gt; 0.01) or the mean dental measures (p &gt; 0.05) at 3 or 6 months compared with pretrial measures. The mean Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit benefit scores showed improvement (p &lt; 0.01) for the Background Noise, Reverberation, and Ease of Communication subscales and the Global scale at 3 and 6 months. The results of the SSD questionnaire indicated that the vast majority (&gt;90%) of the subjects reported satisfaction and improvement in a variety of areas after wearing the device long term.CONCLUSION: The SoundBite system is safe and continues to provide substantial benefit for SSD patients with continual daily use over a 6-month period."
"21595614","[Hearing aid use and patient satisfaction].","OBJECTIVES: In this study, we assessed the hearing aid usage ratios and durations, patient satisfaction and the probable causes of disuse if they are not used.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A questionnaire with 16 questions was applied to the patients who were prescribed hearing aids in our clinic between January 2007 and December 2009. A total of 517 patients were called by phone. Hundred and seventy-nine of the patients (75 females, 104 males; mean age 60±23 years; range 17 to 94 years) participated in the trial. Hearing aid usage ratios and patients' satisfaction were determined and the factors influencing usage were statistically investigated.RESULTS: Hundred and forty-two of the patients used their hearing aids regularly and 37 of the patients either used their aids rarely or never used them. The most common cause reported for disuse was the frequent noise coming from the hearing aid.CONCLUSION: Failure to explain the usage of the hearing aids to the patients and age over 70 years have a statistically significant negative effect on the duration of hearing aid use and patient satisfaction."
"21414178","Functional benefit of the bone-anchored hearing aid with different auditory profiles: objective and subjective measures.","OBJECTIVES: To examine sentence recognition and self-report outcomes in hearing-impaired persons with different auditory profiles and who were fitted unilaterally with a bone-anchored hearing aid.DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.SETTING: Tertiary referral unit.PATIENTS: Data were collected of six patients with single-sided deafness (SSD), seven with a mild to severe hearing loss at the bone-anchored hearing aid side and (near-)normal hearing at the other side and six with a severe bilateral hearing loss.MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Sound field thresholds, and sentence recognition in noise (presented from different angles) with bone-anchored hearing aid, without bone-anchored hearing aid and with bone-anchored hearing aid and other ear occluded. In addition, the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of hearing scale and the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit questionnaire were administered as self-report measures.RESULTS: Patients with single-sided deafness listened mainly with their non-bone-anchored hearing aid ear, although the bone-anchored hearing aid lifted the head shadow effect. Patients with mild to severe hearing loss at the bone-anchored hearing aid side and (near-)normal hearing at the other side performed significantly differently in aided and unaided conditions and even regained limited binaural sensitivity with the device. The latter was also true for the patients with severe bilateral hearing loss. However, their hearing loss at the non-bone-anchored hearing aid side was too great to contribute to hearing and they listened predominantly with their bone-anchored hearing aid. Self-report outcomes provided useful information on hearing disability, although this information was not significantly differently for the 3 groups of patients.CONCLUSIONS: The bone-anchored hearing aid enhanced performance in different hearing configurations, albeit to different extents."
"23231817","Efficacy of hearing-aid based telephone strategies for listeners with moderate-to-severe hearing loss.","BACKGROUND: Understanding speech over the telephone when listening in noisy environments may present a significant challenge for listeners with moderate-to-severe hearing loss.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare speech recognition and subjective ratings across several hearing aid-based telephone listening strategies for individuals with moderate-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss.RESEARCH DESIGN: Speech recognition and subjective ratings were evaluated for a simulated telephone signal. The strategies evaluated included acoustic telephone, unilateral telecoil, unilateral wireless streaming, and bilateral wireless streaming. Participants were seated in a noisy room for all evaluations.STUDY SAMPLE: Eighteen adults, aged 49-88 yr, with moderate-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss participated.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Speech recognition scores on the Connected Speech Test were converted to rationalized arcsine units and analyzed using analysis of variance testing and Tukey post hoc analyses. Subjective ratings of ease and comfort were also analyzed in this manner.RESULTS: Speech recognition performance was poorest with acoustic coupling to the telephone and best with bilateral wireless routing. Telecoil coupling resulted in better speech recognition performance than acoustic coupling, but was significantly poorer than bilateral wireless routing. Furthermore, unilateral wireless routing and telecoil coupling generally led to similar speech recognition performance, except in lower-level background noise conditions, for which unilateral routing resulted in better performance than the telecoil.CONCLUSIONS: For people with moderate-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss, acoustic telephone listening with a hearing aid may not lead to acceptable performance in noise. Although unilateral routing options (telecoil and wireless streaming) improved performance, speech recognition performance and subjective ratings of ease and comfort were best when bilateral wireless routing was used. These results suggest that wireless routing is a potentially beneficial telephone listening strategy for listeners with moderate-to-severe hearing loss who are fitted with limited venting if the telephone signal is routed to both ears. Unilateral wireless routing may provide similar benefits to traditional unilateral telecoil. However, the newer wireless systems may have the advantage for some listeners in that they do not include some of the positioning constraints associated with telecoil use."
"23169196","Subjective and objective outcomes from new BiCROS technology in a veteran sample.","BACKGROUND: Patients with single-sided deafness (SSD), where one ear has an unaidable hearing loss and the other ear has normal or aidable hearing, often complain of difficulties understanding speech and localizing sound sources, and report a higher self-perceived hearing disability. Patients with SSD may benefit from using contralateral routing of signal (CROS) or bilateral contralateral routing of the signal (BiCROS) amplification. Dissatisfaction of previously available (Bi)CROS devices has been reported, such as, interfering transmissions, low-fidelity sound quality, poor &quot;user-friendly&quot; set-up, and a bulky and cosmetically cumbersome appearance.PURPOSE: Recent advances in hearing aid technology have improved (Bi)CROS hearing aids; however, these devices have not been experimentally evaluated. We hypothesized that newer technology with reports of improved digital signal processing, wireless transmission, and physical design would be as good, or better than, our participants' previous-generation BiCROS systems.RESEARCH DESIGN: A within-subjects, pretest-posttest design was executed.STUDY SAMPLE: Thirty-nine veterans (one female, 38 males; mean age = 74 yr, range = 49-85 yr) from the Audiology Section of the Bay Pines Veterans Affair Healthcare System participated. All participants were previously experienced BiCROS hearing aid users with varying degrees of sensorinerual hearing impairment in their better ear.INTERVENTION: Participants were provided at least 4 wk of consistent use with the new BiCROS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSES: Participants completed three research visits. At Visit 1, with their previous BiCROS, and at Visit 3, with their new BiCROS, the following objective and subjective measures were obtained: (1) soundfield speech-in-noise testing using the Words-In-Noise (WIN) test; (2) speech, spatial, and qualities of the hearing scale (SSQ) questionnaire; (3) selected questions from the MarkeTrak questionnaire; and, (4) three open-ended questions. Data were analyzed using parametric and nonparametric statistics.RESULTS: Overall, the objective (WIN) and subjective (SSQ, MarkeTrak, and open-ended questions) measures indicated that the new BiCROS provided better outcomes than the previous BiCROS system. In addition, an overlap of favorable results was seen across measures.CONCLUSIONS: Of the 39 participants, 95% reported improvements with the new BiCROS and chose to utilize the device regularly. The favorable objective and subjective outcomes indicate that the new BiCROS system is as good, or better than, what was previously utilized by our sample of veterans."
"22928919","Speech recognition in noise using bilateral open-fit hearing aids: the limited benefit of directional microphones and noise reduction.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate speech recognition performance in noise with bilateral open-fit hearing aids and as reference also with closed earmolds, in omnidirectional mode, directional mode, and directional mode in conjunction with noise reduction.DESIGN: A within-subject design with repeated measures across conditions was used. Speech recognition thresholds in noise were obtained for the different conditions.STUDY SAMPLE: Twenty adults without prior experience with hearing aids. All had symmetric sensorineural mild hearing loss in the lower frequencies and moderate to severe hearing loss in the higher frequencies.RESULTS: Speech recognition performance in noise was not significantly better with an omnidirectional microphone compared to unaided, whereas performance was significantly better with a directional microphone (1.6 dB with open fitting and 4.4 dB with closed earmold) compared to unaided. With open fitting, no significant additional advantage was obtained by combining the directional microphone with a noise reduction algorithm, but with closed earmolds a significant additional advantage of 0.8 dB was obtained.CONCLUSIONS: The significant, though limited, advantage of directional microphones and the absence of additional significant improvement by a noise reduction algorithm should be considered when fitting open-fit hearing aids."
"22752928","Hearing aid satisfaction and use in the advanced digital era.","HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate satisfaction ratings and use patterns of advanced digital hearing aids (HAs) in a group of hearing-impaired adults by means of self-report questionnaires.STUDY DESIGN: A self report questionnaire study.METHODS: One hundred seventy-seven hearing-impaired adults who were fitted with advanced digital HAs at the Speech and Hearing Center at Sheba Medical Center were asked to participate in a structured telephone interview regarding HA satisfaction and use by means of the Satisfaction With Amplification in Daily Life (SADL) questionnaire. Patients who were not using their HAs completed a nonuse questionnaire.RESULTS: One hundred thirty-one patients participated in the survey, yielding a response rate of 74%. Eighty-three percent used their HAs regularly, whereas 17% were nonusers. Of the users, 92% were satisfied to some degree with their HAs. The global SADL score was 5.12 on a scale of 1 to 7. Background variables that were significantly associated with satisfaction ratings were hours of HA use per day, fitting mode (binaural vs. monaural), age, and degree of hearing loss. Although nonuse was not significantly associated with background variables, the main reasons for nonuse were excessive amplification in background noise and minimal functional benefit.CONCLUSIONS: High satisfaction and use rates were characteristic of adults fitted with advanced digital HAs. Patients should be advised that longer use of HAs per day may lead to higher satisfaction and that binaural amplification is advantageous, especially while communicating in noise. Finally, expectation from HA functionality in challenging listening situations should be realistic, as additional research and technology development is still needed."
"22731922","Acceptable noise level (ANL) with Danish and non-semantic speech materials in adult hearing-aid users.","OBJECTIVE: The acceptable noise level (ANL) test is used for quantification of the amount of background noise subjects accept when listening to speech. This study investigates Danish hearing-aid users' ANL performance using Danish and non-semantic speech signals, the repeatability of ANL, and the association between ANL and outcome of the international outcome inventory for hearing aids (IOI-HA).DESIGN: ANL was measured in three conditions in both ears at two test sessions. Subjects completed the IOI-HA and the ANL questionnaire.STUDY SAMPLE: Sixty-three Danish hearing-aid users; fifty-seven subjects were full time users and 6 were part time/non users of hearing aids according to the ANL questionnaire.RESULTS: ANLs were similar to results with American English speech material. The coefficient of repeatability (CR) was 6.5-8.8 dB. IOI-HA scores were not associated to ANL.CONCLUSIONS: Danish and non-semantic ANL versions yield results similar to the American English version. The magnitude of the CR indicates that ANL with Danish and non-semantic speech materials is not suitable for prediction of individual patterns of future hearing-aid use or evaluation of individual benefit from hearing-aid features. The ANL with Danish and non-semantic speech materials is not related to IOI-HA outcome."
"24227899","Evaluation of hearing aid benefit through a new questionnaire: CISQ (Complete Intelligibility Spatiality Quality).","The purpose of this work was to create a rapid and simple instrument to evaluate the benefits of a hearing aid, that was at the same time reliable and complete. We created a new questionnaire by integration of other well consolidated psychometric tests to better investigate all the aspects that contribute in determining the hearing aid benefit, also considering as important some areas that are not usually considered (spatiality and quality of sound). We started from a 36-item questionnaire divided in six subscales (spatiality and quality of signal, intelligibility in silence, background noise intelligibility, averseness and reverberation), and submitted it to patients before hearing aid application and at 2-3 months after that. A statistically significant difference between results before and after hearing aid application was found. To obtain the final 30-item questionnaire, we analyzed the reliability of each subscale using Cronbach's alpha coefficient, and eliminated the item whose internal consistency was lower for every subscale. For these reasons, the CISQ questionnaire is a rapid and simple test that can be considered a reliable and complete instrument to evaluate the benefits of a hearing aid. Lo scopo di questo lavoro è stato quello di creare un questionario per valutare il beneficio protesico che fosse rapido e di facile utilizzazione, ma allo stesso tempo completo e attendibile. Partendo da altri test psicometrici ormai ben consolidati, abbiamo creato un nuovo questionario in grado di indagare i diversi aspetti che concorrono nel determinare il beneficio protesico del paziente, ovvero il grado di soddisfazione soggettiva che, insieme al guadagno protesico, porta alla definizione della cosiddetta resa protesica. Partendo dai test ad oggi maggiormente utilizzati abbiamo creato un primo questionario costituito da 36 domande, divise per sei sottoscale riguardanti i diversi ambiti che ci interessava indagare: comprensione in ambienti riverberanti, intelligibilità, intelligibilità nel rumore, percezione dei rumori forti, qualità del segnale e spazialità. Abbiamo poi somministrato il questionario a 40 pazienti ipoacusici prima della protesizzazione e tre mesi dopo l'applicazione della stessa, al termine cioè dell'adattamento protesico. Confrontando i due questionari mediante un'analisi statistica è stato possibile evidenziare una differenza statisticamente significativa tra le risposte date prima e dopo la protesizzazione. Affinché il questionario fosse attendibile abbiamo poi calcolato l'Alpha di Cronbach, coefficiente che serve a valutare la coerenza interna di raggruppamenti di items. Abbiamo quindi eliminato per ogni sottoscala la domanda dotata della minore coerenza interna, ottenendo così il questionario definitivo costituito da 30 domande. Il numero relativamente ridotto di items consente la rapida esecuzione del test rendendolo pertanto facilmente fruibile; allo stesso tempo però le sei sottoscale assicurano la completezza dell'indagine, comprendendo anche ambiti solitamente meno indagati (spazialità e qualità del suono). L'analisi statistica e il calcolo dell'Alpha di Cronbach assicurano altresì che le domande siano chiare, che portino a dare risposte nettamente differenti in una condizione di ipoacusia rispetto ad una di buona udibilità, e completamente attendibili. Per tutte queste caratteristiche il questionario CISQ può essere considerato un completo strumento di valutazione del beneficio protesico."
"24099584","Acceptable noise level (ANL) and real-world hearing-aid success in Taiwanese listeners.","OBJECTIVE: The objective of this prospective study was to investigate the relationship between acceptable noise level (ANL), which was measured using Taiwanese and the international speech test signal (ISTS), and real-world hearing-aid success for listeners who were representative of the population commonly seen in clinics.DESIGN: Unaided ANLs were measured pre-hearing-aid fitting. Hearing-aid success was assessed three months post-fitting using the international outcome inventory for hearing aids (IOI-HA) and a hearing-aid use questionnaire.STUDY SAMPLE: Eighty adults with hearing impairment completed the study.RESULTS: Both Taiwanese and ISTS ANLs were significantly associated with hearing-aid success, with higher ANLs suggesting poorer outcomes. However, the ANL's prediction accuracy for the probability of hearing-aid success was either much lower than that suggested by some literature, or was not much different from that of simply predicting all listeners as successful users.CONCLUSIONS: The current study suggested the possibility of using ANL to predict hearing-aid success. However, the usefulness of ANL as a clinical tool is unlikely to be as great as indicated by the literature."
"23856912","The SoundBite hearing system: patient-assessed safety and benefit study.","HYPOTHESIS: To determine the safety and efficacy of the SoundBite for patients over a 6 month period of use.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, multisite, nonrandomized patient enrollment with outcomes based on audiometric profile and self-reported assessment.METHODS: Patients with single-sided deafness were eligible for the study. Patients were fit with the standard SoundBite sound transducer and were asked to wear the device regularly for 6 months. At the end of the trial period, patients completed both a self-assessment and the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) questionnaires.RESULTS: Thirty-four subjects completed the study. Mean APHAB scores improved significantly for ease of communication (P &lt; 0.001), background noise (P &lt; 0.001), reverberation (P &lt; 0.001), and global benefit (P &lt; 0.001). Patients reported high rates of auditory benefit in a variety of listening situations and high rates of overall satisfaction with the device. One adverse event with a superficial mouth sore was reported and resolved after appropriate dental care. Twelve patients (35%) reported acoustic feedback. In six of these patients, the feedback resolved after device adjustment.CONCLUSION: The SoundBite is a new hearing prosthesis that delivers bone conduction energy. It offers advantages over traditional osseointegrated devices that require surgical placement. Patient satisfaction with the device after 6 months of regular use is high. The SoundBite provided improvement in ease of communication, hearing in background noise, sound reverberation, and an overall global hearing benefit. Acoustic feedback is the most commonly reported problem with the SoundBite, and this is minimized with proper fitting."
"23725663","Success and failure factors for hearing-aid prescription: results of a French national survey.","OBJECTIVES: To identify epidemiological, socioeconomic, audiometric and environmental factors of success and failure of hearing-aid prescription, and to assess hearing-aid efficacy at 6-9 months after prescription.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective nationwide survey was conducted in France on 184 patients with age-related hearing loss. Inclusion data were collected by a questionnaire filled out by the ENT specialist and patient, and with a second questionnaire filled out by telephone contact with the patient 6-9 months later.RESULTS: One-third of patients failed to fulfill the prescription, either for financial reasons or for lack of interest in correcting their disability. For the other two-thirds, the factors favoring consultation with a hearing-aid fitting specialist seemed to be: leisure activity requiring good hearing, living in a couple or family, spontaneous initial ENT consultation, strong motivation, monthly income greater than 1200, longstanding hearing impairment, and difficulty in listening to television and following a conversation in noise. Eighty percent of hearing-aid trials were successful; 60% of prescriptions were thus followed by hearing-aid purchase. The main three criteria determining purchase were the advice of the hearing-aid fitting specialist, and the price and the effectiveness of the apparatus on trial. In the four daily life situations presented in the questionnaire, the hearing-aid was worn for 8 hours or more in 90% of cases, found useful in 70% and proved satisfactory in 70%. Age-related hearing loss, whether metabolic or sensorineural, benefited from hearing-aid correction in 86% of cases.CONCLUSIONS: Indications for hearing-aid prescription should take account of the patient's degree of motivation, awareness of disability, and income. The advice of the ENT and hearing-aid fitting specialists plays a key role in the patient's acceptance of the hearing-aid. Hearing-aids seem to enhance quality of life significantly in age-related hearing loss subjects."
"23654396","Effect of spectral change enhancement for the hearing impaired using parameter values selected with a genetic algorithm.","Chen et al. [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 131, 2987-2998 (2012)] evaluated the effectiveness of an algorithm for enhancing spectral changes over time in improving the intelligibility of speech in background sounds for hearing-impaired subjects. The processing improved intelligibility for speech in steady speech-spectrum noise (SSN) but tended to impair intelligibility in a background of two-talker speech (TTS). Large individual differences were found. The present study assessed whether the effectiveness of the algorithm was improved when the parameters that controlled the degree and type of enhancement were chosen individually for each subject, using a genetic algorithm based on subjective preferences for speech clarity. The parameter values selected by the genetic algorithm varied markedly across subjects. Speech intelligibility was measured for unprocessed stimuli and stimuli processed using the selected parameters, with SSN and TTS maskers and two signal-to-masker ratios (SMRs) for each subject. The intelligibility of speech in the SSN masker at the lower SMR was improved about 14 percentage points by the processing. The overall improvement produced by the processing was significantly larger than the improvement observed in the previous study when the parameter values were fixed across subjects, indicating that use of the genetic algorithm was beneficial."

"23357806","Comparison of multichannel wide dynamic range compression and ChannelFree processing in open canal hearing instruments.","BACKGROUND: Multichannel wide dynamic range compression (WDRC) and ChannelFree processing have similar goals yet differ significantly in terms of signal processing. Multichannel WDRC devices divide the input signal into separate frequency bands; a separate level is determined within each frequency band; and compression in each band is based on the level within each band. ChannelFree processing detects the wideband level, and gain adjustments are based on the wideband signal level and adjusted up to 20,000 times per second. Although both signal processing strategies are currently available in hearing aids, it is unclear if differences in these signal processing strategies affect the performance and/or preference of the end user.PURPOSE: The purpose of the research was to determine the effects of multichannel wide dynamic range compression and ChannelFree processing on performance and/or preference of listeners using open-canal hearing instruments.RESEARCH DESIGN: An experimental study in which subjects were exposed to a repeated measures design was utilized.STUDY SAMPLE: Fourteen adult listeners with mild sloping to moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss participated (mean age 67 yr).DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Participants completed two 5 wk trial periods for each signal processing strategy. Probe microphone, behavioral and subjective measures were conducted unaided and aided at the end of each trial period.RESULTS: Behavioral and subjective results for both signal processing strategies were significantly better than unaided results; however, behavioral and subjective results were not significantly different between the signal processing strategies.CONCLUSIONS: Multichannel WDRC and ChannelFree processing are both effective signal processing strategies that provide significant benefit for hearing instrument users. Overall preference between the strategies may be related to the degree of hearing loss of the user, high-frequency in-situ levels, and/or acceptance of background noise."
"23306678","Teleaudiology: evaluation of teleconsultation efficacy for hearing aid fitting.","PURPOSE: To evaluate teleconsultation's efficacy for hearing aid fitting.METHODS: Fifty hearing impaired individuals with ages ranging from 39 to 88 years and mean audiometric thresholds between 30 and 68.75 dBHL participated in this study. Participants were divided into two groups (stratified randomization): control group (n=25), submitted to face-to-face procedures, and experimental group (n=25), submitted to synchronous teleconsultation with interactive video and remote applicative control. The hearing aids were programmed and verified (with microphone probe), and the subjects received instructions regarding use and care for the device. Time taken for the procedures was measured. Following the consultations, an evaluator (blind to the groups) applied the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT-Brazil). Approximately one month after consultations, the daily time of hearing aid use was verified, and the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA) was administered.RESULTS: A greater time for programming and verification and a smaller time for orientation were observed for the experimental group. No difference was found between groups for the total consultation time. The real ear measures' matching to their respective targets was similar for both groups. No difference was observed between groups for the HINT results (silence and noise), the daily amount of use of hearing aids in hours, and the IOI-HA scores.CONCLUSION: Teleconsultation is an efficient procedure for hearing aid programming, verification and fitting when face-to-face services are not available."

Twenty subjects older than 18 years with audiological diagnosis of mild and moderate bilateral descending sensorineural hearing loss were evaluated. The subjects were divided into two groups, where G1 (group 1) was fitted with open-fit hearing aids with the built-in receiver unit (receiver in the ear) and G2 (group 2) was fitted with open-fit hearing aids with RITE. A probe microphone measurement was performed to check the gain and output provided by the amplification and for assessment of speech perception with Hearing in Noise Test with and without hearing aids. After a period of six weeks of use without interruption, the subjects returned for follow-up and answered the Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life questionnaire, and were again subjected to Hearing in Noise Test.RESULTS: Both groups presented better test results for speech recognition in the presence of noise.CONCLUSION: Groups 1 and 2 were satisfied with the use of hearing aids and improved speech recognition in silent and noisy situations with hearing aids."

Hearing thresholds remained the same throughout the study. APHAB results showed a significant benefit (p &lt; 0.001) in categories of ease of communication, reverberation, background noise, and global score. The SSD questionnaire showed a high satisfaction among participants, with 93.8% of patients likely to recommend the IOBC. Dissatisfaction was highest with regard to patient's ability to eat with device, with only 55.6% satisfied. No serious adverse events were reported during the study.CONCLUSION: The IOBC is a safe and effective alternative to percutaneous osseointegrated hearing implants for patients with SSD. Patient satisfaction and improved hearing benefit are observed after 1 year of using the device. The IOBC significantly benefitted patients in APHAB categories of ease of communication, reverberation, background noise, and the overall global hearing score. The in-the-mouth transducer is the least-liked feature for some patients, particularly with regard to eating; however, the majority of patients are willing to deal with the size of the device for the hearing benefit gained."

"24952106","Clinical effectiveness of wireless CROS (contralateral routing of offside signals) hearing aids.","This study evaluated the clinical effectiveness of wireless contralateral routing of offside signals hearing aids (CROS) in patients with severe to profound unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (USNHL). Twenty-one patients with USNHL were enrolled in this prospective study. The change of subjective satisfaction was evaluated using three questionnaires (K-HHIE, K-IOI-HA, K-SSQ). Changes in objective measurements were evaluated with sound localization test (SLT) and hearing in noise test (HINT). These tests were performed at pre-CROS fitting, 2 and 4 weeks after use of CROS. Subjects were grouped according to the age: young (&lt;40 years) vs. old (=40 years) group. The average K-HHIE and K-SSQ scores significantly improved with the use of CROS. SLT result revealed that hit rate and error degree improved in the young group and lateralization ability improved in both groups. In quiet environments, the reception threshold for speech also indicated a significant benefit in the young group. When the noise was presented to the normal ear, HINT revealed benefit of CROS, while loss of performance with CROS use was significant when noise was presented to the impaired ear. Wireless CROS provided increased satisfaction and overall improvement of localization and hearing. Although true binaural hearing cannot be obtained, CROS is a practical option for rehabilitation of USNHL."
"24828216","Prediction of IOI-HA scores using speech reception thresholds and speech discrimination scores in quiet.","BACKGROUND: Outcome measures can be used to improve the quality of the rehabilitation by identifying and understanding which variables influence the outcome. This information can be used to improve outcomes for clients. In clinical practice, pure-tone audiometry, speech reception thresholds (SRTs), and speech discrimination scores (SDSs) in quiet or in noise are common assessments made prior to hearing aid (HA) fittings. It is not known whether SRT and SDS in quiet relate to HA outcome measured with the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA).PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between pure-tone average (PTA), SRT, and SDS in quiet and IOI-HA in both first-time and experienced HA users.RESEARCH DESIGN: SRT and SDS were measured in a sample of HA users who also responded to the IOI-HA.STUDY SAMPLE: Fifty-eight Danish-speaking adult HA users.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The psychometric properties were evaluated and compared to previous studies using the IOI-HA. The associations and differences between the outcome scores and a number of descriptive variables (age, gender, fitted monaurally/binaurally with HA, first-time/experienced HA users, years of HA use, time since last HA fitting, best ear PTA, best ear SRT, or best ear SDS) were examined. A multiple forward stepwise regression analysis was conducted using scores on the separate IOI-HA items, the global score, and scores on the introspection and interaction subscales as dependent variables to examine whether the descriptive variables could predict these outcome measures.RESULTS: Scores on single IOI-HA items, the global score, and scores on the introspection (items 1, 2, 4, and 7) and interaction (items 3, 5, and 6) subscales closely resemble those previously reported. Multiple regression analysis showed that the best ear SDS predicts about 18-19% of the outcome on items 3 and 5 separately, and about 16% on the interaction subscale (sum of items 3, 5, and 6) CONCLUSIONS: The best ears SDS explains some of the variance displayed in the IOI-HA global score and the interaction subscale. The relation between SDS and IOI-HA suggests that a poor unaided SDS might in itself be a limiting factor for the HA rehabilitation efficacy and hence the IOI-HA outcome. The clinician could use this information to align the user's HA expectations to what is within possible reach."
"24687593","Effect of a Bluetooth-implemented hearing aid on speech recognition performance: subjective and objective measurement.","OBJECTIVES: The object was to evaluate speech perception improvement through Bluetooth-implemented hearing aids in hearing-impaired adults.METHODS: Thirty subjects with bilateral symmetric moderate sensorineural hearing loss participated in this study. A Bluetooth-implemented hearing aid was fitted unilaterally in all study subjects. Objective speech recognition score and subjective satisfaction were measured with a Bluetooth-implemented hearing aid to replace the acoustic connection from either a cellular phone or a loudspeaker system. In each system, participants were assigned to 4 conditions: wireless speech signal transmission into hearing aid (wireless mode) in quiet or noisy environment and conventional speech signal transmission using external microphone of hearing aid (conventional mode) in quiet or noisy environment. Also, participants completed questionnaires to investigate subjective satisfaction.RESULTS: Both cellular phone and loudspeaker system situation, participants showed improvements in sentence and word recognition scores with wireless mode compared to conventional mode in both quiet and noise conditions (P &lt; .001). Participants also reported subjective improvements, including better sound quality, less noise interference, and better accuracy naturalness, when using the wireless mode (P &lt; .001).CONCLUSIONS: Bluetooth-implemented hearing aids helped to improve subjective and objective speech recognition performances in quiet and noisy environments during the use of electronic audio devices."
"24384083","Sentence recognition in noise and perceived benefit of noise reduction on the receiver and transmitter sides of a BICROS hearing aid.","BACKGROUND: In the past, bilateral contralateral routing of signals (BICROS) amplification incorporated omnidirectional microphones on the transmitter and receiver sides and some models utilized noise reduction (NR) on the receiver side. Little research has examined the performance of BICROS amplification in background noise. However, previous studies examining contralateral routing of signals (CROS) amplification have reported that the presence of background noise on the transmitter side negatively affected speech recognition. Recently, NR was introduced as a feature on the receiver and transmitter sides of BICROS amplification, which has the potential to decrease the impact of noise on the wanted speech signal by decreasing unwanted noise directed to the transmitter side.PURPOSE: The primary goal of this study was to examine differences in the reception threshold for sentences (RTS in dB) using the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) in a diffuse listening environment between unaided and three aided BICROS conditions (no NR, mild NR, and maximum NR) in the Tandem 16 BICROS. A secondary goal was to examine real-world subjective impressions of the Tandem 16 BICROS compared to unaided.RESEARCH DESIGN: A randomized block repeated measures single blind design was used to assess differences between no NR, mild NR, and maximum NR listening conditions.STUDY SAMPLE: Twenty-one adult participants with asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss (ASNHL) and experience with BICROS amplification were recruited from Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Participants were fit with the National Acoustic Laboratories' Nonlinear version 1 prescriptive target (NAL-NL1) with the Tandem 16 BICROS at the initial visit and then verified using real-ear insertion gain (REIG) measures. Participants acclimatized to the Tandem 16 BICROS for 4 wk before returning for final testing. Participants were tested utilizing HINT sentences examining differences in RTS between unaided and three aided listening conditions. Subjective benefit was determined via the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) questionnaire between the Tandem 16 BICROS and unaided. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilized to analyze the results of the HINT and APHAB.RESULTS: Results revealed no significant differences in the RTS between unaided, no NR, mild NR, and maximum NR. Subjective impressions using the APHAB revealed statistically and clinically significant benefit with the Tandem 16 BICROS compared to unaided for the Ease of Communication (EC), Background Noise (BN), and Reverberation (RV) subscales.CONCLUSIONS: The RTS was not significantly different between unaided, no NR, mild NR, and maximum NR. None of the three aided listening conditions were significantly different from unaided performance as has been reported for previous studies examining CROS hearing aids. Further, based on comments from participants and previous research studies with conventional hearing aids, manufacturers of BICROS amplification should consider incorporating directional microphones and independent volume controls on the receiver and transmitter sides to potentially provide further improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for patients with ASNHL."
"26449672","[Hearing aid fitting: Effect of doubling the standard rate on compliance, quality of results, and excess payments].","BACKGROUND: This study investigates the effect that doubling the standard rate for hearing aid fitting which is covered by statutory insurance has had on the size of excess payments and compliance, as well as on benefits for patients and their satisfaction.METHODS: In April 2014, 859 members of a statutory insurance scheme (hkk) who received hearing aids in the 6 months prior to the reform were questioned on the timing and financial details of their hearing aid fitting, as well as on treatment compliance and quality of the results using a standardized questionnaire. In October 2014, the same questionnaire was used to collect these data from a further 622 insurance holders who had received hearing aids in the 8 months following introduction of the new regulation. Most of the questions concerning hearing quality corresponded to those of the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) questionnaire.RESULTS: The project revealed a statistically significant decrease of 6 percent points in the proportion of hearing aid users who had to pay any excess whatsoever; from 80.6% to 74.1%. However, 40% of the insured persons continued to pay an excess of 1000 euros and more. The subjective hearing quality remained practically unimproved by the reform and was statistically, almost without exception, independent of whether hearing aid users wore expensive devices associated with a large excess, or devices available at the standard rate. Finally, the study confirmed a previously recognized usage pattern characterized by noncompliance. For example, approximately 40% of hearing aid users did not wear their device in the everyday environment. This observation was independent of the size of the excess and the timing of the most recent visit to the hearing aid acoustician.CONCLUSION: Despite doubling of the standard rate, three quarters of patients pay an excess--sometimes a substantial one. The subjective hearing quality was not improved by doubling the standard rate; the majority of patients continue to complain of considerable problems with hearing in difficult situations (environments with background or reverberant noise). Satisfaction with hearing quality is neither dependent on the doubling of the standard rate, nor on whether or not an excess was paid. Compliance may possibly be improved by structured follow-up, which should involve the prescribing otorhinolaryngologists, as well as phoniatrists, pedaudiologists, and hearing aid acousticians."

The aim was to establish the current body of knowledge, identify knowledge gaps, and to suggest possible future directions for research.DESIGN: Data were gathered using a systematic search strategy, consistent with scoping review methodology.STUDY SAMPLE: Searches of public databases between 1988 and 2014 returned 1182 published records. After exclusions for duplicates and out-of- scope works, 75 records remained for further analysis. Content analysis was used to group the records into five separate themes.RESULTS: Content analysis indicated numerous themes relating to background sounds. Five broad emergent themes addressed the development and validation of outcome instruments, satisfaction surveys, assessments of hearing-aid technology and signal processing, acclimatization to the device post-fitting, and non-auditory influences on benefit and satisfaction.CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of hearing-aid users still find particular hearing-aid features and attributes dissatisfying when listening in background sounds. Many conclusions are limited by methodological drawbacks in study design and too many different outcome instruments. Future research needs to address these issues, while controlling for hearing-aid fitting."

Glasgow children's benefit inventory (GCBI) was used to measure subjective benefit of patients under the age of 18.RESULTS: The Baha user questionnaire demonstrated great satisfaction. The mean Baha scores for the subdomains of ease of communication (EC), backgroud noise (BN) and revereration (RV) were decreased by 54.6 ± 10.2 (t = 20.6, P &lt; 0.05), 46.9 ± 11.1 (t = 16.4, P &lt; 0.05) and 58.8 ±15.4 (t = 21.4, P &lt; 0.05) compared to the unaided scores. For the subdomain of aversiveness (AV), the Baha score was 56.7 ± 9.9 (t = 10.8, P &lt; 0.05) higher than the unaided score. The general benefit score GCBI was 41.1 ± 13.0.CONCLUSION: Baha can significantly improve hearing ability and quality of life of patients with bilateral aural atresia."

Quality of life was assessed by two questionnaires, the Bern Benefit in Single Sided Deafness Questionnaire (BBSS) and the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing scale for benefit questionnaire (SSQ-B).RESULTS: Speech discrimination scores measured by OLSA showed a mean signal-to-noise ratio improvement of 1.7 dB SPL for the aided condition compared with the unaided condition in the setting where the sound signal is presented on the side of the implanted ear and the noise is coming from the front (p &lt; 0.05). In the other two settings (signal and noise from front; signal from normal hearing ear and noise from front), the signal-to-noise ratio did not change significantly. This benefit became manifest after 6 months. Good satisfaction was indicated by positive results on the questionnaires.CONCLUSION: Speech discrimination in noise for patients implanted with the BB is comparable with patients with other bone conduction hearing aids. A learning curve is clearly detectable. The subjective benefit was rated positively by the patients. With the advantage of intact skin conditions after implantation, the BB is an adequate option for patients with SSD."
"26055837","Effects of Training on the Use of a Manual Microphone Shutoff on a BiCROS Device.","BACKGROUND: Bilateral contralateral routing of signals (BiCROS) hearing aids function to restore audibility of sounds originating from the side of the unaidable ear. However, when speech is presented to the side of the aidable ear and noise to the side of the unaidable ear, a BiCROS arrangement may reduce intelligibility of the speech signal. This negative effect may be circumvented if an on/off switch is available on the contralateral routing of signals (CROS) transmitter.PURPOSE: This study evaluated if the proper use of the on/off switch on a CROS transmitter could enhance speech recognition in noise and sound localization abilities. The participants' subjective reactions to the use of the BiCROS, including the use of the on/off switch in real-life were also evaluated.RESEARCH DESIGN: A between-subjects, repeated-measures design was used to assess differences in speech recognition (in quiet and in noise) and localization abilities under four hearing aid conditions (unaided, unilaterally aided, fixed BiCROS setting, and adjusted BiCROS setting) with speech and noise stimuli presented from different azimuths. Participants were trained on the use of the on/off switch on the BiCROS transmitter before testing in the adjusted BiCROS settings. Subjective ratings were obtained with the Speech, Spatial, and Sound Quality (SSQ) questionnaire and a custom questionnaire.STUDY SAMPLE: Nine adult BiCROS candidates participated in this study.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Participants wore the Widex Dream-m-CB hearing aid on the aidable ear for 1 week. They then wore the BiCROS for the remainder of the study. Speech recognition and localization testing were completed in four hearing aid conditions (unaided, unilateral aided, fixed BiCROS, and adjusted BiCROS). Speech recognition was evaluated during the first three visits, whereas localization was evaluated over the course of the study. Participants completed the SSQ questionnaire before each visit. The CROS questionnaire was completed at the final visit. A repeated measures analysis of variance with Bonferroni post hoc analysis was used to evaluate the significance of the results on speech recognition, localization, and the SSQ.RESULTS: The results revealed that the adjusted BiCROS condition improved speech recognition scores by 20 rau (rationalized arcsine unit) when speech was presented to the aidable ear and localization by 37% when sounds are presented from the side of the unaidable ear over the fixed BiCROS condition. Statistically significant benefit on the SSQ was also noted with the adjusted BiCROS condition compared to the unilateral fitting.CONCLUSIONS: These findings supported the value of an on/off switch on a CROS transmitter because it allows convenient selective transmission of sounds. It also highlighted the importance of instructions and practice in using the BiCROS hearing aid successfully."
"26021779","Contralateral routing of signal hearing aid versus transcutaneous bone conduction in single-sided deafness.","The aim of this study was to compare a contralateral routing of signal (CROS) hearing aid to a transcutaneous bone-anchored device in the same conditions. This prospective crossover study included 18 adult patients with a single-sided deafness (SSD). After a trial period of 60 days with CROS and 7 days with a transcutaneous bone-anchored device (Alpha 1®, Sophono, Boulder, Colo., USA) on a headband, 13 (72%) patients opted for Alpha 1, 2 patients for CROS, and 3 rejected both rehabilitation methods. Clinical tolerance, satisfaction, hearing performances (pure-tone audiometry, speech test in quiet and in noise, stereo audiometry, sound localization, and Hearing in Noise Test), and quality of life (Glasgow Benefit Inventory, Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit and Glasgow Hearing Aid Benefit questionnaires) were measured at 3 and 12 months after the implantation. Both devices improved equally the hearing in noise and the quality of life. Transcutaneous devices represent an effective option in SSD."
"25924663","Hearing aid or tinnitus masker: which one is the best treatment for blast-induced tinnitus? The results of a long-term study on 974 patients.","The aim of this longitudinal study was to explore whether a hearing aid or noise generator would be an effective audiological treatment for blast-induced chronic tinnitus. The amount of satisfaction from different hearing devices (hearing aid, noise generator, or both) during different time periods (1, 6, 12 and 24 months after fitting) was assessed. The 974 subjects enrolled in this study were Iran-Iraq war veterans, suffering from tinnitus for at least 2 years. About 84% of the subjects preferred just a hearing aid. Only 2.7% chose the noise generator, and the others preferred to use both devices. There were no significant differences between the hearing thresholds of the 3 groups. The satisfaction score for the hearing aid and combined devices increased by time but decreased for the noise generator. There was no correlation between the satisfaction score and parameters such as hearing thresholds, audiogram configuration and tinnitus pitch. We concluded that, compared with a noise generator, the most long-lasting treatment for blast-induced tinnitus is a hearing aid. The possible cause for such a performance is probably the recovery of the auditory function and neuroplasticity through the hearing aid."
"25690777","Estimation of Signal-to-Noise Ratios in Realistic Sound Scenarios.","BACKGROUND: Both in the design of hearing-device features, such as noise reduction, and in the evaluation measurements of such features, there is a need for more information about the sound scenarios hearing-device users encounter. The limitations of adaptive speech tests as outcome measures in the evaluation of hearing-device features have been discussed. The obvious alternative to adaptive speech testing is to test at a fixed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, the question is which SNRs should be used if the test reflects real-life situations.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to estimate SNRs in realistic sound environments encountered by hearing aid users.RESEARCH DESIGN: Research design was a descriptive study where recorded sound files were statistically analyzed.STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 20 experienced, bilaterally fitted hearing aid users, all satisfied with their current hearing aids, made recordings for 3-4 days. The informants were instructed to record different situations in daily life and were told that all situations were of equal importance. The informants ranged in age from 18-81 yr old, and they had various occupations and varying hearing-loss configurations.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The total duration of the recorded material for each informant was, on average, 84 min; the number of recordings was, on average, 17 per informant. The sound files were categorized based on the type of background noise and were analyzed with use of a manual noise estimation procedure. Segments of speech with noise present were cut out from the original recordings. Corresponding noise-only segments were also extracted. On the basis of power calculations for these two types of recorded segments, the SNR was estimated. Frequency-specific and overall SNRs, calculated both based on unweighted and A-weighted speech and noise levels, were derived. An estimation uncertainty measure was also developed.RESULTS: The range of SNRs found in the material was large. The most striking finding was that there were very few recorded situations where the SNR was negative or even close to 0 dB. For speech-in-babble noise, the average SNR was approximately 5 dB. The estimation uncertainty was generally low but became higher in highly fluctuating noises and at very low SNRs.CONCLUSIONS: The estimated SNRs were higher than previously reported. The results can be used in the design and evaluation of hearing-device features."

The aim of this review is to synthesize current evidence to identify the determinants of hearing-aid adoption and use among the elderly.DESIGN: Systematic review.STUDY SAMPLE: Articles were identified through systematic searches in the Web of Science, Medline, CINAHL, and a manual search. Studies that explore the potential determinants of hearing-aid usage were to be included.RESULTS: A total of twenty-two articles were reviewed. Four audiological determinants (the severity of hearing loss, the type of hearing aids, background noise acceptance, and insertion gain) and seven non-audiological determinants (self-perceived hearing problems, expectation, demographics, group consultation, support from significant others, self-perceived benefit, and satisfaction) were identified as affecting the adoption and use of hearing aids.CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to explore the influence of significant others, health professionals, and user demographics on hearing rehabilitation for future research. The determinants identified in this review depicted the stage progression of the trans-theoretical model (TTM) in explaining an individual's readiness to hearing-aid usage."

"27697129","Auditory profiling and hearing-aid satisfaction in hearing-aid candidates.","INTRODUCTION: Hearing-impaired (HI) listeners often complain about difficulties communicating in the presence of background noise, although audibility may be restored by a hearing-aid (HA). The audiogram typically forms the basis for HA fitting, i.e. people with similar audiograms are given the same prescription by default. This study aimed at identifying clinically relevant tests that may serve as an informative addition to the audiogram and which may relate more directly to HA satisfaction than the audiogram does.METHODS: A total of 29 HI and 26 normal-hearing listeners performed tests of spectral and temporal resolution, binaural hearing, speech intelligibility in stationary and fluctuating noise and a working-memory test. Six weeks after HA fitting, the HI listeners answered a questionnaire evaluating HA treatment.RESULTS: No other measures than masking release between fluctuating and stationary noise correlated significantly with audibility. The HI listeners who obtained the least advantage from fluctuations in background noise in terms of speech intelligibility experienced greater HA satisfaction.CONCLUSION: HI listeners have difficulties in different hearing domains that are not predictable from their audiogram. Measures of temporal resolution or speech perception in both stationary and fluctuating noise could be relevant measures to consider in an extended auditory profile.FUNDING: The study was supported by Grosserer L.F.

"26859460","Objective and Subjective Outcome of a New Transcutaneous Bone Conduction Hearing Device: Half-year Follow-up of the First 12 Nordic Implantations.","OBJECTIVE: To examine the objective and subjective outcome of a new transcutaneous bone conduction hearing device.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, consecutive case series.PATIENTS: Twelve patients were implanted. Eight patients had a conductive/mixed (con/mix) hearing loss. Four had single sided deafness.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At half-year follow-up, aided and unaided sound field hearing was evaluated by 1) warble tone thresholds, 2) pure-tone average (PTA4), 3) speech discrimination score (SDS) in quiet, and 4) speech reception threshold 50% at 70<U+200A>dB SPL noise level (SRT50%). Subjective outcome was evaluated by three questionnaires: 1) International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids, 2) Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale 12, and 3) a questionnaire on frequency and duration of use.RESULTS: No major complications occurred. The mean aided PTA4 was lowered by 23dB. SDS was increased by 40% at 50dB, by 34% at 65dB, and by 12% at 80<U+200A>dB SPL. SRT50% in noise improved 5.2<U+200A>dB. 58% of the patients used the device daily and 83% at least 5 days a week. 50% used the device = 8 hours and 75% = 4 <U+200A>hours a day. Mean International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids score was 3.7, corresponding to beneficial outcome. In Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale 12, &quot;quality of hearing&quot; scored especially high. The con/mix hearing loss group showed larger benefit especially in SDS, SRT50% in noise and the subjective evaluations, whereas frequency and duration of use were similar.CONCLUSION: This study on the first 12 Nordic patients implanted with a new transcutaneous bone conduction hearing device demonstrates significant objective, as well as subjective hearing benefit. Patient satisfaction was high, as was the frequency of use."
"29095240","Hearing Handicap and Speech Recognition Correlate With Self-Reported Listening Effort and Fatigue.","OBJECTIVES: To investigate the correlations between hearing handicap, speech recognition, listening effort, and fatigue.DESIGN: Eighty-four adults with hearing loss (65 to 85 years) completed three self-report questionnaires: the Fatigue Assessment Scale, the Effort Assessment Scale, and the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Elderly. Audiometric assessment included pure-tone audiometry and speech recognition in noise.RESULTS: There was a significant positive correlation between handicap and fatigue (r = 0.39, p &lt; 0.05) and handicap and effort (r = 0.73, p &lt; 0.05). There were significant (but lower) correlations between speech recognition and fatigue (r = 0.22, p &lt; 0.05) or effort (r = 0.32, p&lt; 0.05). There was no significant correlation between hearing level and fatigue or effort.CONCLUSIONS: Hearing handicap and speech recognition both correlate with self-reported listening effort and fatigue, which is consistent with a model of listening effort and fatigue where perceived difficulty is related to sustained effort and fatigue for unrewarding tasks over which the listener has low control. A clinical implication is that encouraging clients to recognize and focus on the pleasure and positive experiences of listening may result in greater satisfaction and benefit from hearing aid use."
"28590898","Tinnitus Management: Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Extended-Wear Hearing Aids, Conventional Hearing Aids, and Combination Instruments.","BACKGROUND: Whereas hearing aids have long been considered effective for providing relief from tinnitus, controlled clinical studies evaluating this premise have been very limited.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to systematically determine the relative efficacy of conventional receiver-in-the-canal hearing aids (HA), the same hearing aids with a sound generator (HA+SG), and extended-wear, deep fit hearing aids (EWHA), to provide relief from tinnitus through a randomized controlled trial. Each of these ear-level devices was a product of Phonak, LLC.RESEARCH DESIGN: Participants were randomized to HA, HA+SG, or EWHA and wore bilaterally fit devices for about 4 months. Fittings, adjustments, and follow-up appointments were conducted to comply with company guidelines and to ensure that all participants attended appointments on the same schedule. At 4-5 months, participants returned to complete final outcome measures, which concluded their study participation.STUDY SAMPLE: Participants were 55 individuals (mean age: 63.1 years) with mild to moderately-severe hearing loss who: (a) did not currently use hearing aids; (b) reported tinnitus that was sufficiently bothersome to warrant intervention; and (c) were suitable candidates for each of the study devices.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The primary outcome measure was the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI). Secondary outcome measures included hearing-specific questionnaires and the Quick Speech in Noise test (QuickSIN). The goal of the analysis was to evaluate efficacy of the EWHA and HA+SG devices versus the HA standard device.RESULTS: There were 18 participants in each of the HA and EWHA groups and 19 in the HA+SG group. Gender, age, and baseline TFI severity were balanced across treatment groups. Nearly all participants had a reduction in tinnitus symptoms during the study. The average TFI change (improvement) from baseline was 21 points in the HA group, 31 points in the EWHA group, and 33 points in the HA+SG group. A &quot;clinically significant&quot; improvement in reaction to tinnitus (at least 13-point reduction in TFI score) was seen by 67% of HA, 82% of EWHA, and 79% of HA+SG participants. There were no statistically significant differences in the extent to which the devices reduced TFI scores. Likewise, the hearing-specific questionnaires and QuickSIN showed improvements following use of the hearing aids but these improvements did not differ across device groups.CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to conclude that any of these devices offers greater relief from tinnitus than any other one tested. However, all devices appear to offer some improvement in the functional effects of tinnitus."
"28553093","Applications of direct-to-consumer hearing devices for adults with hearing loss: a review.","BACKGROUND: This systematic literature review is aimed at investigating applications of direct-to-consumer hearing devices for adults with hearing loss. This review discusses three categories of direct-to-consumer hearing devices: 1) personal sound amplification products (PSAPs), 2) direct-mail hearing aids, and 3) over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids.METHOD: A literature review was conducted using EBSCOhost and included the databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. After applying prior agreed inclusion and exclusion criteria, 13 reports were included in the review.RESULTS: Included studies fell into three domains: 1) electroacoustic characteristics, 2) consumer surveys, and 3) outcome evaluations. Electroacoustic characteristics of these devices vary significantly with some meeting the stringent acoustic criteria used for hearing aids, while others producing dangerous output levels (ie, over 120-dB sound pressure level). Low-end (or low-cost) devices were typically poor in acoustic quality and did not meet gain levels necessary for most adult and elderly hearing loss patterns (eg, presbycusis), especially in high frequencies. Despite direct-mail hearing aids and PSAPs being associated with lower satisfaction when compared to hearing aids purchased through hearing health care professionals, consumer surveys suggest that 5%-19% of people with hearing loss purchase hearing aids through direct-mail or online. Studies on outcome evaluation suggest positive outcomes of OTC devices in the elderly population. Of note, OTC outcomes appear better when a hearing health care professional supports these users.CONCLUSION: While some direct-to-consumer hearing devices have the capability to produce adverse effects due to production of dangerously high sound levels and internal noise, the existing literature suggests that there are potential benefits of these devices. Research of direct-to-consumer hearing devices is limited, and current published studies are of weak quality. Much effort is needed to understand the benefits and limitations of such devices on people with hearing loss."
"28534117","A multicenter study on objective and subjective benefits with a transcutaneous bone-anchored hearing aid device: first Nordic results.","Examination of objective as well as subjective outcomes with a new transcutaneous bone-anchored hearing aid device. The study was designed as a prospective multicenter consecutive case-series study involving tertiary referral centers at two Danish University Hospitals. A total of 23 patients were implanted. Three were lost to follow-up. Patients had single-sided deafness, conductive or mixed hearing loss.INTERVENTION: Rehabilitative. Aided and unaided sound field hearing was evaluated objectively using (1) pure warble tone thresholds, (2) pure-tone average (PTA4), (3) speech discrimination score (SDS) in quiet, and (4) speech reception threshold 50% at 70 dB SPL noise level (SRT50%). Subjective benefit was evaluated by three validated questionnaires: (1) the IOI-HA, (2) the SSQ-12, and (3) a questionnaire evaluating both the frequency and the duration of hearing aid usage. The mean aided PTA4 was lowered by 14.7 dB. SDS was increased by 37.5% at 50 dB SPL, SRT50% in noise improved 1.4 dB. Aided thresholds improved insignificantly at frequencies above 2 kHz. 52.9% of the patients used their device every day, and 76.5% used the device at least 5 days a week. Mean IOI-HA score was 3.4, corresponding to a good benefit. In SSQ-12, &quot;quality of hearing&quot; scored especially high. Patients with a conductive and/or mixed hearing loss benefitted the most. This device demonstrates a significant subjective hearing benefit 8 month post surgery. In patients with conductive and/or mixed hearing losses, patient satisfaction and frequency of use were high. Objective gain measures showed less promising results especially in patients with single-sided deafness (SSD) compared to other bone conduction devices."
"28286364","Considerations in the Development of a Sound Tolerance Interview and Questionnaire Instrument.","Most clinicians approach the objective fitting of hearing aids with three goals in mind: audibility, comfort, and tolerance. When these three amplification goals have been met, the hearing aid user is more likely to adapt to and perceive benefit from hearing aid use. However, problems related to the loudness of sounds and reduced sound tolerance, which may or may not be reported by the aided user, can adversely impact adaptation to amplification and the individual's quality of life. Although there are several standardized questionnaires available to evaluate hearing aid benefit and satisfaction, there is no standardized questionnaire or interview tool for evaluating reduced sound tolerance and the related impact on hearing aid use. We describe a 36-item tool, the Sound Tolerance Questionnaire (STQ), consisting of six sections, including experience with hearing aids, sound sensitivity/intolerance, medical and noise exposure histories, coexisting tinnitus problems, and a final question to differentiate the primary and secondary problems related to sound intolerance, tinnitus, and hearing loss. In its current format as a research tool, the STQ was sensitive in pinpointing vague sound tolerance complaints not reported by the study participants in eligibility screening by Formby et al. A refined version of the STQ, the Sound Tolerance Interview and Questionnaire Instrument (STIQI), structured as a two-part tool, is presented in the appendix for prospective clinical use. The STIQI has potential utility to delineate factors contributing to loudness complaints and/or reduced sound tolerance in individuals considering hearing aid use, as well as those who have been unsuccessful hearing aid users secondary to loudness complaints or sound intolerance. The STIQI, when validated and refined, also may hold promise for predicting hearing aid benefit and/or assessing treatment-related change over time of hearing aid use or interventions designed to remediate problems of loudness and/or sound intolerance among hearing aid candidates or users."
"28112001","Comparison of single-microphone noise reduction schemes: can hearing impaired listeners tell the difference?","OBJECTIVE: The perceived qualities of nine different single-microphone noise reduction (SMNR) algorithms were to be evaluated and compared in subjective listening tests with normal hearing and hearing impaired (HI) listeners.DESIGN: Speech samples added with traffic noise or with party noise were processed by the SMNR algorithms. Subjects rated the amount of speech distortions, intrusiveness of background noise, listening effort and overall quality, using a simplified MUSHRA (ITU-R, 2003 ) assessment method.STUDY SAMPLE: 18 normal hearing and 18 moderately HI subjects participated in the study.RESULTS: Significant differences between the rating behaviours of the two subject groups were observed: While normal hearing subjects clearly differentiated between different SMNR algorithms, HI subjects rated all processed signals very similarly. Moreover, HI subjects rated speech distortions of the unprocessed, noisier signals as being more severe than the distortions of the processed signals, in contrast to normal hearing subjects.CONCLUSIONS: It seems harder for HI listeners to distinguish between additive noise and speech distortions or/and they might have a different understanding of the term &quot;speech distortion&quot; than normal hearing listeners have. The findings confirm that the evaluation of SMNR schemes for hearing aids should always involve HI listeners."
"28054911","Evaluation of a Wind Noise Attenuation Algorithm on Subjective Annoyance and Speech-in-Wind Performance.","BACKGROUND: Wind noise is a common problem reported by hearing aid wearers. The MarkeTrak VIII reported that 42% of hearing aid wearers are not satisfied with the performance of their hearing aids in situations where wind is present.PURPOSE: The current study investigated the effect of a new wind noise attenuation (WNA) algorithm on subjective annoyance and speech recognition in the presence of wind.RESEARCH DESIGN: A single-blinded, repeated measures design was used.STUDY SAMPLE: Fifteen experienced hearing aid wearers with bilaterally symmetrical (=10 dB) mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss participated in the study.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Subjective rating for wind noise annoyance was measured for wind presented alone from 0° and 290° at wind speeds of 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10 m/sec. Phoneme identification performance was measured using Widex Office of Clinical Amplification Nonsense Syllable Test presented at 60, 65, 70, and 75 dB SPL from 270° in the presence of wind originating from 0° at a speed of 5 m/sec.RESULTS: The subjective annoyance from wind noise was reduced for wind originating from 0° at wind speeds from 4 to 7 m/sec. The largest improvement in phoneme identification with the WNA algorithm was 48.2% when speech was presented from 270° at 65 dB SPL and the wind originated from 0° azimuth at 5 m/sec.CONCLUSION: The WNA algorithm used in this study reduced subjective annoyance for wind speeds ranging from 4 to 7 m/sec. The algorithm was effective in improving speech identification in the presence of wind originating from 0° at 5 m/sec. These results suggest that the WNA algorithm used in the current study could expand the range of real-life situations where a hearing-impaired person can use the hearing aid optimally."
"29915453","Benefits from, Satisfaction with, and Self-Efficacy for Advanced Digital Hearing Aids in Users with Mild Sensorineural Hearing Loss.","Little evidence is available regarding outcomes of advanced digital technology (ADT) hearing aid wearers with mild sensorineural hearing loss (MSNHL). The purpose of this article is to report the characteristics of and outcomes for this population. A cross-sectional research design was employed with 56 participants from a private practice setting. The International Outcomes Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA), Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life (SADL), and the Measure of Audiologic Rehabilitation Self-Efficacy for Hearing Aids (MARS-HA) were completed, scored, and compared with normative data. Results revealed that ADT aids were worn 10.5 hours/day, were mostly advanced to premium (55%), had an average cost per aid of $2,138 (SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>$840), and provided significant benefit (IOI-HA overall score: mean<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.1; SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.6) and satisfaction (SADL global score: mean<U+2009>=<U+2009>5.4; SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.8) to users who had good overall self-efficacy (MARS-HA composite score: mean<U+2009>=<U+2009>81.7; SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>12.8). Patients were most dissatisfied with and had the least self-efficacy for managing background noise and advanced handling of their devices. ADT hearing aid users with MSNHL achieved excellent outcomes, but ongoing follow-up and counseling from hearing health care providers may be important for successful management of background noise and mastery of advanced handling skills."
"29716438","Outcomes With a Self-Fitting Hearing Aid.","Self-fitting hearing aids (SFHAs)-devices that enable self-directed threshold measurements leading to a prescribed hearing aid (HA) setting, and fine-tuning, without the need for professional support-are now commercially available. This study examined outcomes obtained with one commercial SFHA, the Companion (SoundWorld Solutions), when support was available from a clinical assistant during self-fitting. Participants consisted of 27 experienced and 25 new HA users who completed the self-fitting process, resulting in 38 user-driven and 14 clinician-driven fittings. Following 12 weeks' experience with the SFHAs in the field, outcomes measured included the following: coupler gain and output, HA handling and management skills, speech recognition in noise, and self-reported benefit and satisfaction. In addition, the conventionally fitted HAs of 22 of the experienced participants who had user-driven fittings were evaluated. Irrespective of HA experience, the type of fitting (user- or clinician-driven) had no significant effect on coupler gain, speech recognition scores, or self-reported benefit and satisfaction. Users selected significantly higher low-frequency gain in the SFHAs when compared with the conventionally fitted HAs. The conventionally fitted HAs were rated significantly higher for benefit and satisfaction on some subscales due to negative issues with the physical design and implementation of the SFHAs, rather than who drove the fitting process. Poorer cognitive function was associated with poorer handling and management of the SFHAs. Findings suggest that with the right design and support, SFHAs may be a viable option to improve the accessibility of hearing health care."
