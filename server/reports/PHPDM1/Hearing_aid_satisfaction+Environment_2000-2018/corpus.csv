"10990015","A comparison of wind noise in four hearing instruments.","Wind noise was measured in four behind-the-ear hearing instruments with different microphone openings. A silent airflow of 7 m/s was directed toward the ear of a Kemar head and the resulting wind noise was measured. The amplification was set to an insertion gain of 35 dB at 1.6 kHz. The wind noise amplitude at the position of the drum ranged from 84 to 97 dB(A). The hearing instrument with a partially covered microphone entrance proved best, whereas one with an open microphone entrance had the poorest performance. A reduction in wind noise of 6-17 dB could be achieved in all hearing instruments by using a simple windscreen made of Styrofoam. The windscreen affected the frequency response by less than 2 dB. By subtracting the insertion gain from the wind noise, an equivalent wind noise could be presented as a function of frequency. A considerable difference was found between the wind noise sensitivity in different hearing instruments. All could be improved by a windscreen without adversely affecting the frequency response."
"11324843","Using conjoint analysis to examine the importance of hearing aid attributes.","OBJECTIVE: To introduce conjoint analysis (CA) as a method to explain choice decisions of hearing aid users and to measure the contributions of different hearing aid attributes involved.DESIGN: The study was conducted using CA, a method that is well established in marketing, but has not been used for hearing aid research. CA examines the contributions (importance) various attributes make to overall preference judgements. It is based on the premises that objects (i.e., hearing aids) can be described as different combinations of several attributes. The relative importance of the attributes is estimated from integral judgements of hypothetical hearing aids. The advantages of CA are a more realistic presentation of complete products instead of isolated attributes and the consideration of trade-offs between the features. The following attributes selected from 12 features in a prestudy were included in the application: speech perception in quiet, speech perception in noise, handling, sound quality, localization, and feedback. 93 randomly chosen experienced hearing aid wearers participated in the survey.RESULTS: It was found that the attributes concerning speech perception were by far most important. Speech discrimination in quiet and in noise were almost equally significant and contributed with 56% to the preference decisions of the subjects. The remaining attributes showed values in the range of 10% to 12%. When comparing various subgroups dependent on age, sex, hearing loss, satisfaction, etc., significant differences concerning the preferences were found. Elder and female subjects attached greater importance of the attribute &quot;handling&quot; whereas younger patients judged &quot;speech in noise&quot; more important. In general, subjects with greater hearing loss considered speech intelligibility in quiet to be more important than in noisy surroundings. Moreover, sound quality seems to be a significant indicator for satisfaction with the hearing aid.CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes CA as a survey technique to examine individual preferences for hearing aids. Several assumptions about the importance of hearing aid features for different groups of users could be confirmed quantitatively. Segmentation showed valid results depending on socio-demographic and user-specific parameters. The method used and the results are of interest for audiologists as well as the hearing aid industry. They provide valuable tools for future hearing aid design and should be considered in the development of self-assessment inventories."
"11192875","Early clinical results: SOUNDTEC implantable hearing device phase II study.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of a new semi-implantable electromagnetic hearing device, the SOUNDTEC Direct Drive Hearing System (DDHS), and to compare its performance with that of subjects' previously worn, optimally fit hearing aids. Preliminary results for the first 10 subjects are presented.STUDY DESIGN: The protocol specified in the Investigational Device Exemption is used in this ongoing FDA phase II 100-subject multicenter clinical trial.METHODS: For baseline, each subject is tested wearing his or her own optimally fit hearing aid in the ear to be implanted. Six-month postoperative outcome measures using the SOUNDTEC DDHS are compared with the baseline. Multiple objective and subjective outcomes (as listed under Results) were measured.RESULTS: When compared with the subjects' optimally fit hearing aids, the SOUNDTEC DDHS provided an average improvement of 52% in functional gain (250-6000 Hz), 22% in aided thresholds, 3.8% for speech discrimination in quiet, 17% for speech in noise, 13.1% in articulation index scores, 28% in aided benefit, 27.3% in sound quality of speech, and a 16.7% increase in overall subject satisfaction. In addition, with the SOUNDTEC DDHS, subjects reported absence of acoustic feedback, little or no occlusive effects, and more natural sound perception.CONCLUSION: Analysis of data on the first 10 subjects using the SOUNDTEC DDHS indicates positive outcomes regarding safety and efficacy, although the small sample size is not sufficient to permit valid statistical inferences to be drawn from our preliminary data. Results also demonstrate improvement in performance compared with the subjects' optimally fit hearing aids and an improvement in quality of life as demonstrated by objective and subjective tests and measures."
"12141388","Influence of environmental factors on hearing aid microphone preference.","The purpose of this study was to identify characteristics of everyday listening situations that influence user preferences for omnidirectional versus directional hearing aid microphones. Eleven experienced hearing aid users were fitted with digital hearing aids featuring switchable omnidirectional (OMNI) and adaptive-directional (DIR) modes (programs). For 6 weeks, their task was to identify and describe at least one listening situation each day in which one program performed better than the other using a checklist daily journal format. All participants reported difficulty identifying situations in which they could perceive a difference between the two microphone modes. Although an equal number had been requested, descriptions favoring the DIR outnumbered those for the OMNI. Chi-square tests were used to compare the distributions of 60 descriptions favoring the OMNI and 155 favoring the DIR across variables associated with the primary talker to whom the hearing aid user was listening, background noise, and other environmental characteristics. The results indicated that location of the primary talker, presence or absence and type of background noise, and type of space in which the communication occurred influenced microphone choice."
"15603458","Comparison of speech perception in background noise with acceptance of background noise in aided and unaided conditions.","Background noise is a significant factor influencing hearing-aid satisfaction and is a major reason for rejection of hearing aids. Attempts have been made by previous researchers to relate the use of hearing aids to speech perception in noise (SPIN), with an expectation of improved speech perception followed by an increased acceptance of hearing aids. Unfortunately, SPIN was not related to hearing-aid use or satisfaction. A new measure of listener reaction to background noise has been proposed. The acceptable noise level (ANL), expressed in decibels, is defined as a difference between the most comfortable listening level for speech and the highest background noise level that is acceptable when listening to and following a story. The ANL measure assumes that speech understanding in noise may not be as important as is the willingness to listen in the presence of noise. It has been established that people who accept background noise have smaller ANLs and tend to be &quot;good&quot; users of hearing aids. Conversely, people who cannot accept background noise have larger ANLs and may only use hearing aids occasionally or reject them altogether. Because this is a new measure, it was important to determine the reliability of the ANL over time with and without hearing aids, to determine the effect of acclimatization to hearing aids, and to compare the ANL to well-established measures such as speech perception scores collected with the SPIN test. Results from 50 listeners indicate that for both good and occasional hearing aid users, the ANL is comparable in reliability to the SPIN test and that both measures do not change with acclimatization. The ANLs and SPIN scores are unrelated. Although the SPIN scores improve with amplification, the ANLs are unaffected by amplification, suggesting that the ANL is inherent to an individual and can be established prior to hearing aid fitting as a possible predictor of hearing-aid use."
"15224866","Clinical trial of a low-cost, solar-powered hearing aid.","OBJECTIVE: In July 2001 the World Health Organization (WHO) launched their &quot;Guidelines for hearing aids and services for developing countries&quot;. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of an analogue, low-cost, behind-the-ear hearing aid (BTE-HA) that met the minimum technical requirements outlined by the WHO.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 25 subjects (17 males, 8 females; median age 74 years; range 50-86 years) were recruited among patients referred for audiological evaluation who consented to participate in the trial. All subjects had a hearing loss of &lt; or = 60 dB HL at 2 kHz, were mobile and mentally unimpaired; 13 were experienced users of HAs, 3 suffered from mixed conductive/sensorineural hearing impairment (HI) and the remainder had pure sensorineural HI. Based on pure-tone, speech and impedance audiometry the BTE-HAs were fitted, using the National Acoustic Laboratories-R (NAL-R) prescription rule, 21 binaurally and 4 monaurally. All fittings were validated by insertion gain measurements, and the immediate benefit was measured by means of the speech recognition score in background noise (SRSN; signal:noise ratio = 10 dB) without and with the HA. After a 6-week trial period a structured interview based on the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HAs) was performed.RESULTS: The results showed that the amplification of the HA deviated significantly from the NAL-R target at all frequencies, giving significantly more amplification at 500 and 1000 Hz despite maximum bass-cut, whenever relevant, and significantly less amplification as required at 2, 3 and 4 kHz. The median SRSN without HA was 48% (range 0-96%), which improved significantly to 80% (range 24-100%) with HA. The median individual difference in SRSN without and with HA was 20% (range 0-72%). The total IOI-HA score with the test HA was 4.1 (range 2.6-4.6), showing that it offered subjectively high satisfaction and reduction in limitations of activity.CONCLUSIONS: The low-cost HA: (i) provides benefit to the hearing-impaired person; (ii) offers poor amplification in the high frequencies; and (iii) gives subjective satisfaction similar to that for modern available HAs."
"16012028","Digital hearing aids for high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss: preliminary experience with the RetroX device.","CONCLUSIONS: The RetroX outer ear hearing aid seems to represent a means of overcoming problems with understanding speech in noise in patients with high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) without the need to wear conventional completely-in-the-canal (CIC) hearing aids, which are usually reported to annoy patients as a result of the occlusion effect.OBJECTIVE: To present preliminary data from a study carried out to compare the efficacy, in the same individual, of a standard digital CIC hearing aid and a new implantable outer ear canal device, the RetroX.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three out of 15 adults affected by high-frequency SNHL who were candidates for auditory rehabilitation were evaluated by using speech audiometric tests in quiet and noise as well as a questionnaire shortly after use of a CIC hearing aid and the RetroX device, i.e. at 7 and 14 days. The efficacy of the RetroX was anticipated by testing all the subjects using a RetroX simulating system before starting the study protocol.RESULTS: In all three implanted patients, the RetroX provided better audiological benefit for speech understanding in noise. These findings were corroborated by the results of the questionnaire, which showed greater satisfaction with the RetroX, especially regarding the absence of the occlusion effect."

Comparison of self-questionnaires completed by the patients during a 12 week period with amplification alone to a 12 week period with amplification and noise.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: His study demonstrates that the level of suffering is significantly reduced during the period with added noise."
"16959733","Amplification with digital noise reduction and the perception of annoying and aversive sounds.","Hearing aid users report difficulties using their hearing aids in noisy environments. Problems include understanding speech, loudness discomfort, and annoyance with background noise. Digital noise reduction algorithms have been promoted as a method to solve speech understanding and comfort in noise problems. Research has failed to find improved speech understanding in noise. Little is known about how digital noise reduction affects noise annoyance and aversiveness. The goals of this investigation were to determine how a specific digital noise reduction system affects hearing aid users' perception of noise annoyance and aversiveness and to compare their perceptions to those of normal-hearing listeners. Ratings of noise annoyance and of aversiveness were obtained from 49 participants with moderate sensorineural hearing loss before fitting and after 3 weeks of hearing aid use. Findings were compared to measures obtained from normal-hearing listeners. Perceived annoyance and aversiveness increased with amplification. Annoyance and aversiveness with the hearing aid approximated normal perception. The results of this investigation suggest the need for counseling patients about realistic expectations related to annoyance and aversiveness of sounds at the time of hearing aid fitting."
"16927516","Improving speech intelligibility in background noise with an adaptive directional microphone.","Omnidirectional, supercardioid, and adaptive directional microphones (ADM) were evaluated in combination with the ADRO amplification scheme for eight participants with moderate sloping hearing losses. The ADM produced better speech perception scores than the other two microphones in all noise conditions. Participants performed the Hearing in Noise Test sentences at -4.5 dB SNR or better, which is similar to the level achievable with normal hearing. The Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale indicated no disadvantages of using the ADM relative to the omnidirectional microphone in real-life situations. The ADM was preferred over the omnidirectional microphone in 54% of situations, compared to 17% preferences for the omnidirectional microphone, and 29% no preference. The combination of the ADM to improve SNR, and ADRO to keep the signal output comfortable and audible provided near-normal hearing performance for people with moderate hearing loss. The ADM is the recommended microphone configuration for ADRO hearing aids."
"16787899","The effects of high-frequency amplification on the objective and subjective performance of hearing instrument users with varying degrees of high-frequency hearing loss.","PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to determine if amplifying beyond 2 kHz affected the objective and subjective performance of hearing instrument users with varying degrees of mild-to-severe high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss.METHOD: Twenty participants were fitted binaurally with digital completely-in-the-canal devices with 4-channel wide dynamic range compression (Starkey Axent). Each participant used the hearing instruments for two 6-week trial periods. Each hearing instrument was programmed to maximize high-frequency audibility during 1 trial period and minimize high-frequency audibility during the other trial period. Objective evaluations were conducted in quiet using the Connected Speech Test (CST) and in noise using the CST and the Hearing in Noise Test. Subjective performance was evaluated by administering the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit and a questionnaire.RESULTS: Results indicated that high-frequency amplification significantly improved objective performance in noise and subjective preference in quiet for listeners with varying degrees of mild-to-severe high-frequency hearing loss. Results also suggested that high-frequency amplification may affect subjective preference in noise and overall for listeners with varying degrees of mild-to-severe high-frequency hearing loss when feedback is eliminated.CONCLUSION: Based on these significant benefits, dispensers should be aware that high-frequency amplification should, at least initially, be provided to the affected high-frequency regions when mild-to-severe hearing loss is present."
"16672792","The Performance-Perceptual Test (PPT) and its relationship to aided reported handicap and hearing aid satisfaction.","OBJECTIVE: Results of objective clinical tests (e.g., measures of speech understanding in noise) often conflict with subjective reports of hearing aid benefit and satisfaction. The Performance-Perceptual Test (PPT) is an outcome measure in which objective and subjective evaluations are made by using the same test materials, testing format, and unit of measurement (signal-to-noise ratio, S/N), permitting a direct comparison between measured and perceived ability to hear. Two variables are measured: a Performance Speech Reception Threshold in Noise (SRTN) for 50% correct performance and a Perceptual SRTN, which is the S/N at which listeners perceive that they can understand the speech material. A third variable is computed: the Performance-Perceptual Discrepancy (PPDIS); it is the difference between the Performance and Perceptual SRTNs and measures the extent to which listeners &quot;misjudge&quot; their hearing ability. Saunders et al. in 2004 examined the relation between PPT scores and unaided hearing handicap. In this publication, the relations between the PPT, residual aided handicap, and hearing aid satisfaction are described.DESIGN: Ninety-four individuals between the ages of 47 and 86 yr participated. All had symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss and had worn binaural hearing aids for at least 6 wk before participating. All subjects underwent routine audiological examination and completed the PPT, the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly/Adults (HHIE/A), and the Satisfaction for Amplification in Daily Life questionnaire. Sixty-five subjects attended one research visit for participation in this study, and 29 attended a second visit to complete the PPT a second time.RESULTS: Performance and Perceptual SRTN and PPDIS scores were normally distributed and showed excellent test-retest reliability. Aided SRTNs were significantly better than unaided SRTNs; aided and unaided PPDIS values did not differ. Stepwise multiple linear regression showed that the PPDIS, the Performance SRTN, and age were significant predictors of scores on the HHIE/A such that greater reported handicap is associated with underestimating hearing ability, poorer aided ability to understand speech in noise, and being younger. Scores on the Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life were not well explained by the PPT, age, or audiometric thresholds. When individuals were grouped by their HHIE/A scores, it was seen that individuals who report more handicap than expected based on their audiometric thresholds, have a more negative PPDIS, i.e., underestimate their hearing ability, relative to individuals who report expected handicap, who in turn have a more negative PPDIS than individuals who report less handicap than expected. No such patterns were apparent for the Performance SRTN.CONCLUSIONS: The study showed the PPT to be a reliable outcome measure that can provide more information than a performance measure and/or a questionnaire measure alone, in that the PPDIS can provide the clinician with an explanation for discrepant objective and subjective reports of hearing difficulties. The finding that self-reported handicap is affected independently by both actual ability to hear and the (mis)perception of ability to hear underscores the difficulty clinicians encounter when trying to interpret outcomes questionnaires. We suggest that this variable should be measured and taken into account when interpreting questionnaires and counseling patients."
"16436986","Amplification in the rehabilitation of unilateral deafness: speech in noise and directional hearing effects with bone-anchored hearing and contralateral routing of signal amplification.","OBJECTIVE: Vibromechanical stimulation with a semi-implantable bone conductor (Entific BAHA device) overcomes some of the head-shadow effects in unilateral deafness. What specific rehabilitative benefits are observed when the functional ear exhibits normal hearing versus moderate sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL)?DESIGN: The authors conducted a prospective trial of subjects with unilateral deafness in a tertiary care center.PATIENTS: This study comprised adults with unilateral deafness (pure-tone average [PTA] &gt; 90 dB; Sp.D. &lt; 20%) and either normal monaural hearing (n = 18) or moderate SNHL (PTA = 25-50 dB: Sp.D. &gt; 75%) in the contralateral functional ear (n = 5).INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were fit with contralateral routing of signal (CROS) devices for 1 month and tested before (mastoid) implantation, fitting, and testing with a bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA).OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were: 1) subjective benefit; 2) source localization tests (Source Azimuth Identification in Noise Test [SAINT]); 3) speech discrimination in quiet and in noise assessed with Hearing In Noise Test (HINT) protocols.RESULTS: There was consistent satisfaction with BAHA amplification and poor acceptance of CROS amplification. General directional hearing decreased with CROS use and was unchanged by BAHA and directional microphone aids. Relative to baseline and CROS, BAHA produced significantly better speech recognition in noise. Twenty-two of 23 subjects followed up in this study continue to use their BAHA device over an average follow-up period of 30.24 months (range, 51-12 months).CONCLUSION: BAHA amplification on the side of a deaf ear yields greater benefit in subjects with monaural hearing than does CROS amplification. Advantages likely related to averting the interference of speech signals delivered to the better ear, as occurs with conventional CROS amplification, while alleviating the negative head-shadow effects of unilateral deafness. The advantages of head-shadow reduction in enhancing speech recognition with noise in the hearing ear outweigh disadvantages inherent in head-shadow reduction that can occur by introducing noise from the deaf side. The level of hearing impairment correlates with incremental benefit provided by the BAHA. Patients with a moderate SNHL in the functioning ear perceived greater increments in benefit, especially in background noise, and demonstrated greater improvements in speech understanding with BAHA amplification."
"17715647","The robustness of hearing aid microphone preferences in everyday listening environments.","Automatic directionality algorithms currently implemented in hearing aids assume that hearing-impaired persons with similar hearing losses will prefer the same microphone processing mode in a specific everyday listening environment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the robustness of microphone preferences in everyday listening. Two hearing-impaired persons made microphone preference judgments (omnidirectional preferred, directional preferred, no preference) in a variety of everyday listening situations. Simultaneously, these acoustic environments were recorded through the omnidirectional and directional microphone processing modes. The acoustic recordings were later presented in a laboratory setting for microphone preferences to the original two listeners and other listeners who differed in hearing ability and experience with directional microphone processing. The original two listeners were able to replicate their live microphone preferences in the laboratory with a high degree of accuracy. This suggests that the basis of the original live microphone preferences were largely represented in the acoustic recordings. Other hearing-impaired and normal-hearing participants who listened to the environmental recordings also accurately replicated the original live omnidirectional preferences; however, directional preferences were not as robust across the listeners. When the laboratory rating did not replicate the live directional microphone preference, listeners almost always expressed no preference for either microphone mode. Hence, a preference for omnidirectional processing was rarely expressed by any of the participants to recorded sites where directional processing had been preferred as a live judgment and vice versa. These results are interpreted to provide little basis for customizing automatic directionality algorithms for individual patients. The implications of these findings for hearing aid design are discussed."
"19045657","The effect of the base line response on self-adjustments of hearing aid gain.","Self-adjustments of variable hearing aid parameters are essential for trainable hearing aids to provide customized amplification for different listening environments. Prompted by a finding of Dreschler et al. [Ear Hear. 29, 214-227 (2008)], this study investigates the effect of the base line (starting) response on self-adjustments of gain in different frequency bands. In a laboratory test, 24 hearing-impaired listeners adjusted the bass, treble, and overall gain to reach their preferred responses from two different base line responses for 12 different listening situations. The adjustments were repeated five times using the preferred response after each adjustment as base line response for the next adjustment. Half of the listeners further compared three different response shapes, within the range of preferred responses, pairwise ten times for preferential and perceptual discrimination. The results revealed that base line response biases were more pronounced at low frequencies and for listeners with a flat hearing loss configuration. While 83% of listeners reliably discriminated between the average selected biased responses, only 25% demonstrated reliable preferences for one response over the other. Listeners who showed preferential discrimination ability were those who were less biased by the base line response. The clinical implication is that self-adjustments should begin from an appropriately prescribed starting response."
"18795473","Recording and classification of the acoustic environment of hearing aid users.","This article investigates the different acoustic signals that hearing aid users are exposed to in their everyday environment. Binaural microphone signals from recording positions close to the microphone locations of behind-the-ear hearing aids were recorded by 20 hearing aid users during daily life. The recorded signals were acoustically analyzed with regard to narrowband short-term level distributions. The subjects also performed subjective assessments of their own recordings in the laboratory using several questions from the Glasgow Hearing Aid Benefit Profile (GHABP) questionnaire. Both the questionnaire and the acoustic analysis data show that the importance, problems, and hearing aid benefit as well as the acoustic characteristics of the individual situations vary a lot across subjects. Therefore, in addition to a nonlinear hearing aid fitting, further signal classification and signal/situation-adaptive features are highly desirable inside modern hearing aids. These should be compatible with the variability of the individual sound environments of hearing-impaired listeners."
"18664691","Candidacy for bilateral hearing aids: a retrospective multicenter study.","PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to find factors for refining candidacy criteria for bilateral hearing aid fittings. Clinical files of 1,000 consecutive hearing aid fittings were analyzed.METHOD: Case history, audiometric, and rehabilitation data were collected from clinical files, and an extensive questionnaire on long-term outcome measures was conducted. After at least 2 years of hearing aid use, 505 questionnaires were returned. In order to compare differences in benefits between unilateral and bilateral fittings, two subgroups were composed in which most relevant variables (age, degree of hearing loss, and audiometric asymmetry) were matched for unilateral fittings (n=212) and bilateral fittings (n=477).RESULTS: The bilateral group had significantly higher benefit scores than the unilateral group for detection, speech intelligibility in reverberation, and localization, but poorer scores for comfort of loud sounds. The benefit of bilateral hearing aids was not significantly related to the level of technology of the hearing aids.CONCLUSION: The analysis of the relation between objective parameters and the subjective outcome measures showed that candidacy for a successful bilateral fitting could not be predicted from age, maximum speech intelligibility, employment, exposure to background noise, or social activities."
"18326151","The objective and subjective evaluation of low-frequency expansion in wide dynamic range compression hearing instruments.","The effects of low-frequency expansion on the objective and subjective evaluation of four channel in-the-ear hearing instruments was investigated. Three expansion settings were programmed in each device: expansion off, expansion restricted to channel one, and expansion restricted to channels one and two. Objective evaluations were conducted in quiet (Connected Speech Test) and in noise (Hearing in Noise Test) with speech levels fixed at 40 dB SPL. Subjectively, each participant rated expansion satisfaction in quiet and listening to low-level speech in a sound-treated room then indicated the expansion condition preferred overall. Listeners performed significantly better in quiet and in noise for the Off and Channel 1 conditions than the Channels 1 and 2 condition; however, performance was similar between the Off and Channel 1 conditions. Expansion effects on listener satisfaction ratings depended on the listening environment. Overall, listeners preferred expansion in Channel 1 to expansion in Channels 1 and 2; however, preference was not significantly different between the Channel 1 and Off conditions. Results indicate restricting expansion to 1000 Hz overcomes speech-recognition deficits observed with expansion active across a broader spectrum without significantly reducing subjective benefit or preference."
"18230861","Relationship between acceptable noise level and the abbreviated profile of hearing aid benefit.","PURPOSE: This study investigated the relationship between acceptable noise levels (ANLs) and the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB; R. M. Cox &amp; G. C. Alexander, 1995). This study further examined the APHAB's ability to predict hearing aid use.METHOD: ANL and APHAB data were collected for 191 listeners with impaired hearing, separated into 3 groups based on hearing aid use: full-time, part-time, or nonuse.RESULTS: Results demonstrated ANLs were not correlated with APHAB scores. Results further demonstrated 2 of the 4 APHAB subscales (Ease of Communication [EC] and Background Noise [BN]) predicted hearing aid success with 60% accuracy, which is 25% poorer than that observed using the ANL alone. When combining the ANL with the EC and BN subscales, accuracy of the prediction increased to 91%. Lastly, 3 of the 4 APHAB subscales (EC, BN, and Reverberation) enhanced the present prediction of hearing aid use for patients with mid-range ANLs.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that ANLs and APHAB scores provide unique information regarding hearing aid use. These results further indicate that the prediction can be enhanced by administering both the ANL and the EC and BN APHAB subscales. Lastly, some of the ambiguity of the prediction of hearing aid use for listeners with mid-range ANLs may be eliminated."
"18230860","Acceptance of noise growth patterns in hearing aid users.","PURPOSE: To examine whether the effects of speech presentation level on acceptance of noise could differentiate full-time, part-time, and nonusers of hearing aids and whether these effects could predict hearing aid use.METHOD: Participants were separated into 3 groups on the basis of hearing aid use: (a) full-time use, (b) part-time use, or (c) nonuse. Acceptable noise levels (ANLs) were measured conventionally and at 8 fixed presentation levels. The effects of presentation level on ANL were determined by calculating global ANL (ANL averaged across presentation level) and ANL growth (slope of the ANL function).RESULTS: Global ANLs were smaller for full-time users than for part-time users and nonusers; however, global ANLs were not different for part-time users and nonusers. ANL growth differentiated full-time users from nonusers only. Conventional ANL predicted hearing aid use with 68% accuracy. Compared with conventional ANL, the accuracy of the prediction for global ANL and ANL growth decreased, and the accuracy of the prediction at presentation levels of 65 to 75 dB HL was maintained.CONCLUSIONS: Global ANL differentiated the hearing aid groups in the same manner as conventional ANL. The effects of presentation level on acceptance of noise did not considerably increase the accuracy of the prediction compared with conventional ANL. Clinical applications are discussed."
"20017682","Environmental noise reduction configuration: Effects on preferences, satisfaction, and speech understanding.","The effects of four configurations of an environmental noise reduction (ENR) algorithm on preferences, speech understanding, and satisfaction were investigated. The gain reduction at 0 dB modulation depth was either 10 dB in all channels (ENR StrongFlat) or shaped from 2-10 dB across channels according to a speech importance function (ENR MildSII). This gain reduction was either invariant (ENR Constant) or varied with (ENR Variable) the noise level. Ten hearing-impaired participants blindly compared pairs of configurations in real-world situations and recorded their preferences. Sentence reception thresholds (SRTs) were measured in quiet and noise, and satisfaction was rated with speech in noise. Half of the participants preferred ENR MildSII and half preferred ENR StrongFlat. All preferred ENR Variable to ENR Constant. Overall, the preferred ENR configuration was preferred to ENR off in 90% of responses. No statistically significant effect on SRTs was found, but a clinically significant effect of up to 2 dB could not be ruled out from the available data. ENR significantly improved satisfaction for listening comfort, ease of speech understanding, and sound quality."
"19692903","Development of APHAB norms for WDRC hearing aids and comparisons with original norms.","OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken for two purposes: First, to provide a comparison of subjective performance and benefit measured with the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) questionnaire for two groups. One group included hearing-impaired individuals using 1990s-era linear processing hearing aids. The other group included hearing-impaired individuals using more current wide-dynamic range compression (WDRC)-capable hearing aids fit using current practice protocols. The second purpose of this study was to determine whether APHAB norms derived from scores for current hearing aid users were different from the original 1995 norms. It was hypothesized that technology improvements would result in improved subjective performance for modern hearing aid wearers.DESIGN: A systematic sampling method was used to identify and recruit subjects from seven private-practice audiology clinics located across the United States. Potential subjects were limited to older hearing-impaired individuals who were wearing hearing aids capable of WDRC processing. One hundred fifty-four subjects returned completed APHAB questionnaires. Participants reported mostly moderate to moderately severe subjective hearing difficulty.RESULTS: No differences in perceived difficulty with speech communication were observed between the two groups. However, aversiveness of amplified sound was less frequently reported for users of WDRC-capable hearing aids. Norms were generated using data from all of the operationally defined successful hearing aid users in the sample and compared with the original 1995 norms. Differences between the 1995 and 2005 norms were minimal for the speech communication subscales. However, the 2005 group consistently reported less frequent difficulties with sound aversiveness (AV subscale) in the aided condition. In addition to these findings, an improvement was observed in the rate of successful adjustment to hearing aids between 1995 (43%) and 2005 (82%).CONCLUSIONS: Overall, problems understanding amplified speech did not decrease in frequency when hearing aids transitioned from linear to compression processing; however, the compression capabilities of current hearing aids (with a possible contribution from noise reduction algorithms) have resulted in less negative reactions to amplified environmental sounds. This suggests that modern technology has ameliorated (to some extent) the common complaint that hearing aids cause many everyday sounds to become objectionably loud. Although the results of this study suggest that the advantages of improved technology do not lie in the domains of improved subjective speech communication performance, substantial improvement in the rate of successful adjustment to hearing aids between the 1995 and 2005 subject groups provides evidence that modern hearing aid technology has produced progress in other outcome domains."
"19585963","Expectations, prefitting counseling, and hearing aid outcome.","BACKGROUND: Data suggest that having high expectations about hearing aids results in better overall outcome. However, some have postulated that excessively high expectations will result in disappointment and thus poor outcome. It has been suggested that counseling patients with unrealistic expectations about hearing aids prior to fitting may be beneficial. Data, however, are mixed as to the effectiveness of such counseling, in terms of both changes in expectations and final outcome.PURPOSE: The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether supplementing prefitting counseling with demonstration of real-world listening can (1) alter expectations of new hearing aid users and (2) increase satisfaction over verbal-only counseling. Secondary goals of the study were to examine (1) the relationship between prefitting expectations and postfitting outcome, and (2) the effect of hearing aid fine-tuning on hearing aid outcome.RESEARCH DESIGN: Sixty new hearing aid users were fitted binaurally with Beltone Oria behind-the-ear digital hearing aids. Forty participants received prefitting counseling and demonstration of listening situations with the Beltone AVE (Audio Verification Environment) system; 20 received prefitting counseling without a demonstration of listening situations. Hearing aid expectations were measured at initial contact and following prefitting counseling. Reported hearing aid outcome was measured after eight to ten weeks of hearing aid use.STUDY SAMPLE: Sixty new hearing aid users aged between 55 and 81 years with symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss.INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups, between which the prefitting counseling and follow-up differed: Group 1 received prefitting counseling in combination with demonstration of listening situations. Additionally, if the participant had complaints about sound quality at the follow-up visit, the hearing aids were fine-tuned using the Beltone AVE system. Group 2 received prefitting counseling in combination with demonstration of listening situations with the Beltone AVE system, but no fine-tuning was provided at follow-up. Group 3 received prefitting hearing aid counseling that did not include demonstration of listening, and the hearing aids were not fine-tuned at the follow-up appointment.RESULTS: The results showed that prefitting hearing aid counseling had small but significant effects on expectations. The two forms of counseling did not differ in their effectiveness at changing expectations; however, anecdotally, we learned from many participants that that they enjoyed listening to the auditory demonstrations and that they found them to be an interesting listening exercise. The data also show that positive expectations result in more positive outcome and that hearing aid fine-tuning is beneficial to the user.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that prefitting counseling can be advantageous to hearing aid outcome and recommend the addition of prefitting counseling to address expectations associated with quality of life and self-image. The data emphasize the need to address unrealistic expectations prior to fitting hearing aids cautiously, so as not to decrease expectations to the extent of discouraging and demotivating the patient. Data also show that positive expectations regarding the impact hearing aids will have on psychosocial well-being are important for successful hearing aid outcome."
"19418710","Evaluation of a &quot;direct-comparison&quot; approach to automatic switching in omnidirectional/directional hearing aids.","BACKGROUND: Hearing aids today often provide both directional (DIR) and omnidirectional (OMNI) processing options with the currently active mode selected automatically by the device. The most common approach to automatic switching involves &quot;acoustic scene analysis&quot; where estimates of various acoustic properties of the listening environment (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio [SNR], overall sound level) are used as a basis for switching decisions.PURPOSE: The current study was carried out to evaluate an alternative, &quot;direct-comparison&quot; approach to automatic switching that does not involve assumptions about how the listening environment may relate to microphone preferences. Predictions of microphone preference were based on whether DIR- or OMNI-processing of a given listening environment produced a closer match to a reference template representing the spectral and temporal modulations present in clean speech.RESEARCH DESIGN: A descriptive and correlational study. Predictions of OMNI/DIR preferences were determined based on degree of similarity between spectral and temporal modulations contained in a reference, clean-speech template, and in OMNI- and DIR-processed recordings of various listening environments. These predictions were compared with actual preference judgments (both real-world judgments and laboratory responses to the recordings).DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Predictions of microphone preference were based on whether DIR- or OMNI-processing of a given listening environment produced a closer match to a reference template representing clean speech. The template is the output of an auditory processing model that characterizes the spectral and temporal modulations associated with a given input signal (clean speech in this case). A modified version of the spectro-temporal modulation index (mSTMI) was used to compare the template to both DIR- and OMNI-processed versions of a given listening environment, as processed through the same auditory model. These analyses were carried out on recordings (originally collected by Walden et al, 2007) of OMNI- and DIR-processed speech produced in a range of everyday listening situations. Walden et al reported OMNI/DIR preference judgments made by raters at the same time the field recordings were made and judgments based on laboratory presentations of these recordings to hearing-impaired and normal-hearing listeners. Preference predictions based on the mSTMI analyses were compared with both sets of preference judgments.RESULTS: The mSTMI analyses showed better than 92% accuracy in predicting the field preferences and 82-85% accuracy in predicting the laboratory preference judgments. OMNI processing tended to be favored over DIR processing in cases where the analysis indicated fairly similar mSTMI scores across the two processing modes. This is consistent with the common clinical assignment of OMNI mode as the default setting, most likely to be preferred in cases where neither mode produces a substantial improvement in SNR. Listeners experienced with switchable OMNI/DIR hearing aids were more likely than other listeners to favor the DIR mode in instances where mSTMI scores only slightly favored DIR processing.CONCLUSIONS: A direct-comparison approach to OMNI/DIR mode selection was generally successful in predicting user preferences in a range of listening environments. Future modifications to the approach to further improve predictive accuracy are discussed."
"19307291","Hearing aid outcomes for listeners with high-frequency hearing loss.","PURPOSE: To determine whether listeners with primarily high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (HF SNHL) perceived benefit from amplification provided by completely-in-the-canal (CIC) hearing aids.METHOD: The Hearing Handicap for the Elderly-Screening version, the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit, and the Satisfaction With Amplification in Daily Life questionnaires were mailed to 2 groups of listeners (n = 79) who matched preset criteria, including threshold at 2000 Hz and use of CIC amplification. Sixty-seven percent (n = 53) of the questionnaires were returned and were divided into 2 groups. Group I (n = 26) consisted of listeners with normal hearing through 2000 Hz, and Group II (n = 27) consisted of listeners with normal hearing only through 1000 Hz.RESULTS: Results revealed that both groups perceived significant hearing handicap, hearing aid benefit, and hearing aid satisfaction. Differences between the 2 groups on the 3 measures, however, were not statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: Listeners with HF SNHL perceived benefit and satisfaction from amplification with CIC hearing aids. Individuals with SNHL limited to the high frequencies should be considered candidates for amplification."
"19194292","Spatial benefit of bilateral hearing AIDS.","OBJECTIVES: To assess the extent to which hearing aids improve spatial benefit by restoring the availability of interaural difference cues, the benefit attributable to spatial separation of speech and babble with and without bilateral hearing aids was measured as a function of low-pass cutoff frequency.DESIGN: Twenty-one older adults with sloping high-frequency hearing loss were provided commercially available bilateral hearing aids. After a 3 to 6 month acclimatization period, speech levels corresponding to 50% correct recognition of sentences from the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) were measured in a 65-dB SPL babble, with speech and babble low-pass filtered at 1.8, 3.6, and 5.6 kHz. Sentences were always at 0 degrees azimuth, and babble was at either 0 degrees or 90 degrees . Speech and babble spectra for all conditions were digitally recorded using a probe microphone placed in each ear canal of each subject. Spectra and levels of speech and babble and unaided thresholds for narrowband noises were used to calculate the aided audibility index and provide predictions of unaided and aided thresholds for HINT sentences, hearing aid benefit, and spatial benefit for each cutoff frequency. In addition, subjects' willingness to tolerate background noise with and without amplification was measured in the spatially coincident and spatially separated conditions using the Acceptable Noise Level (ANL) procedure.RESULTS: Thresholds for HINT sentences in babble and ANL improved significantly when aided and when speech and babble were spatially separated. Specifically, hearing aid benefit improved significantly as cutoff frequency increased from 1.8 to 3.6 kHz but only when speech and babble were spatially separated; likewise, spatial benefit improved significantly from 1.8 to 3.6 kHz but only in the aided condition. No further improvement in hearing aid or spatial benefit was observed when cutoff frequency was increased from 3.6 to 5.6 kHz, although improvement in hearing aid benefit was predicted.CONCLUSIONS: Hearing aid benefit, although significant, was poorer than predicted, suggesting that these older adults with high-frequency hearing loss did not take full advantage of the increase in audible speech information provided by amplification. Hearing aid benefit was also limited because hearing aids for some subjects did not restore speech audibility across the full bandwidth of speech. Unaided and aided spatial benefit was significantly greater than predicted, and aided spatial benefit was greater than unaided. This suggests that these older adults were able to take advantage of interaural level and time difference cues to improve speech recognition in babble and that they benefited from these cues to a greater extent with than without bilateral hearing aids. Finally, in contrast to results of previous studies, ANL may vary for an individual depending on the listening condition."

"20807482","Effects of acoustical stimuli delivered through hearing aids on tinnitus.","BACKGROUND: The use of acoustic signals to mask, mix with, or ease the distress associated with tinnitus has been clinically employed for decades. It has been proposed that expanding acoustic options for tinnitus sufferers due to personal preferences is desirable. Fractal tones incorporate many useful characteristics of music while avoiding certain features that could be distracting to some individuals.PURPOSE: To assess the effects on relaxation, tinnitus annoyance, tinnitus handicap, and tinnitus reaction from the use of a hearing aid that incorporates combinations of amplification, fractal tones, and white noise.RESEARCH DESIGN: Participants listened to experimental hearing aids containing several acoustic options and were asked to rate the signals in terms of their effect on relaxation and tinnitus annoyance. They subsequently wore the hearing aids for 6 mo and completed tinnitus handicap and reaction scales.STUDY SAMPLE: Fourteen hearing-impaired adults with primary complaints of subjective tinnitus.INTERVENTION: Participants were tested wearing hearing aids containing several programs including amplification only, fractal tones only, and a combination of amplification, noise, and/or fractal tones. The fractal tones (now commercially available as the &quot;Zen&quot; feature) were generated by the Widex Mind hearing aid. Rating procedures were conducted in the laboratory, and tinnitus reaction and handicap were assessed during and following a 6 mo field trial.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were collected at the initial visit, one week, 1 mo, 3 mo, and 6 mo. Nonparametric statistics included Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank, chi(2), and repeated-measures analyses of variance.RESULTS: Thirteen of 14 participants reported that their tinnitus annoyance, as measured by the Tinnitus Annoyance Scale, was reduced for at least one of the amplified conditions (with or without fractal tones or noise), relative to the unaided condition. Nine assigned a lower tinnitus annoyance rating when listening to fractal tones alone versus the amplification-alone condition. There was a range of preferences observed for fractal settings, with most participants preferring fractals with a slow or medium tempo and restricted dynamic range. The majority (86%) indicated that it was easier to relax while listening to fractal signals. Participants had preferences for certain programs and fractal characteristics. Although seven participants rated the noise-only condition as providing the least tinnitus annoyance, only two opted to have noise only as a program during the field trial, and none selected the noise-only condition as the preferred setting. Furthermore, while all four of the experienced hearing aid users selected noise as producing the least annoying tinnitus in the laboratory, only one selected it for field wear. Tinnitus Handicap Inventory and Tinnitus Reaction Questionnaire scores were improved over the course of the 6 mo trial, with clinically significant improvements occurring for over half of the participants on at least one of the measures.CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that use of acoustic stimuli, particularly fractal tones, delivered though hearing aids can provide amplification while allowing for relief for some tinnitus sufferers. It is important to recognize, however, that tinnitus management procedures need to be supplemented with appropriate counseling."
"20053153","A multi-site evaluation of a proposed test for verifying hearing aid maximum output.","The aim of this study was to evaluate a clinical test proposed to verify the output setting of hearing aids. Across three test sites, 56 bilaterally fitted hearing aid users were recruited. They answered questions about real-life loudness discomfort experiences and then completed the output verification test. Using an ascending method, a 1,500 kHz narrowband noise and a selection of broadband environmental noises were presented in 5 dB steps from 80 to 90 dB SPL. Response options included 'acceptably loud', and 'uncomfortably loud'. A swept pure tone presented at 90 dB SPL was also administered. Some loudness discomfort was reportedly experienced in real life by 82% of the participants. Generally, the test noises produced low specificity, with the 1,500 kHz narrowband noise being the best predictor of loudness discomfort experiences in real life, while the swept pure tone showed low sensitivity. Individual reactions to specific sounds and the test equipment and environment used are argued to affect the laboratory performance. A better understanding of these factors is needed before the test can be improved. an ser mejoradas."
"21916792","Comparison of two bone anchored hearing instruments: BP100 and Ponto Pro.","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at investigating if there were differences in auditory performance, operation, or user preference between the Ponto Pro or the BP100, two bone anchored hearing instruments (BAHI) with modern sound processing technology.DESIGN: Subjects wore the devices in daily life in a crossover study for periods ranging from 25 to 63 days. A speech-in-noise test was carried out as well as measures of noise reduction and feedback suppression algorithms. User satisfaction was reported using the NSH and the GHABP questionnaires. At the end of the test, subjects selected one of the devices for permanent use.STUDY SAMPLE: Twelve first-time users of BAHIs.RESULTS: Eight subjects selected the Ponto Pro; four selected the BP100. The Ponto Pro was rated as easier to operate than the BP100, the visual appearance of the Ponto Pro was rated as nicer than that of the BP100, and speech understanding was rated higher with the Ponto Pro than with the BP100. Speech-in-noise tests showed improvements using directional microphones with the Ponto Pro.CONCLUSIONS: 67% of the subjects opted for permanent use of the Ponto Pro, which, compared to the BP100, was rated to have a nicer look, to be easier to operate, and to yield better speech intelligibility."
"21864473","Hearing aids in the real world: use of multimemory and volume controls.","BACKGROUND: Despite advances in technology, hearing aid users continue to express a desire for some control over their devices. Access to a suitable control can significantly affect overall satisfaction with amplification, yet little is known about the circumstances that drive hearing aid users to manipulate controls. Such information would be useful in guiding clinical decisions about the selection of controls and synchronization of their operation in a bilateral pair of hearing aids.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the real-world use of multimemory (MM) and volume (VC) controls and environmental characteristics that may influence their use.RESEARCH DESIGN: Real-time data about MM and VC usage were gathered in the real world. Subjective reports of the environmental characteristics were obtained. This design allowed examination of the nature of hearing aid adjustments as well as exploration of factors affecting them.STUDY SAMPLE: Ten adults with bilaterally symmetric, mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss participated in the study. All had previous experience with hearing aids.INTERVENTION: Participants were fitted bilaterally with BTE (behind-the-ear) hearing aids equipped with an MM button and/or VC wheel. The devices were connected to a PDA (personal digital assistant) that logged data from the hearing aids and stored surveys completed by participants in various listening situations.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The following data were obtained from the PDA: (1) MM and VC settings in the left and right devices, (2) broadband input level at the microphone of the left and right devices, and (3) participant reports of the presence, distance, and location of signal and background noise. Prevalence of nondefault settings and bilateral symmetry of hearing aid adjustments were summarized descriptively, while the influence of environmental characteristics on hearing aid adjustments was analyzed using nonparametric methods.RESULTS: Over 4-5 wk, 912 hr of data were logged and 184 surveys completed. Results showed that (1) the default (i.e., the programmed or &quot;use&quot;) setting was preferred most often, (2) the preferred hearing aid settings were mostly bilaterally symmetrical, and (3) nondefault settings were often used in difficult listening situations.CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study generally support the use of synchronized MMs and/or VCs, although there may be exceptions to their utility."
"23231817","Efficacy of hearing-aid based telephone strategies for listeners with moderate-to-severe hearing loss.","BACKGROUND: Understanding speech over the telephone when listening in noisy environments may present a significant challenge for listeners with moderate-to-severe hearing loss.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare speech recognition and subjective ratings across several hearing aid-based telephone listening strategies for individuals with moderate-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss.RESEARCH DESIGN: Speech recognition and subjective ratings were evaluated for a simulated telephone signal. The strategies evaluated included acoustic telephone, unilateral telecoil, unilateral wireless streaming, and bilateral wireless streaming. Participants were seated in a noisy room for all evaluations.STUDY SAMPLE: Eighteen adults, aged 49-88 yr, with moderate-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss participated.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Speech recognition scores on the Connected Speech Test were converted to rationalized arcsine units and analyzed using analysis of variance testing and Tukey post hoc analyses. Subjective ratings of ease and comfort were also analyzed in this manner.RESULTS: Speech recognition performance was poorest with acoustic coupling to the telephone and best with bilateral wireless routing. Telecoil coupling resulted in better speech recognition performance than acoustic coupling, but was significantly poorer than bilateral wireless routing. Furthermore, unilateral wireless routing and telecoil coupling generally led to similar speech recognition performance, except in lower-level background noise conditions, for which unilateral routing resulted in better performance than the telecoil.CONCLUSIONS: For people with moderate-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss, acoustic telephone listening with a hearing aid may not lead to acceptable performance in noise. Although unilateral routing options (telecoil and wireless streaming) improved performance, speech recognition performance and subjective ratings of ease and comfort were best when bilateral wireless routing was used. These results suggest that wireless routing is a potentially beneficial telephone listening strategy for listeners with moderate-to-severe hearing loss who are fitted with limited venting if the telephone signal is routed to both ears. Unilateral wireless routing may provide similar benefits to traditional unilateral telecoil. However, the newer wireless systems may have the advantage for some listeners in that they do not include some of the positioning constraints associated with telecoil use."
"23169196","Subjective and objective outcomes from new BiCROS technology in a veteran sample.","BACKGROUND: Patients with single-sided deafness (SSD), where one ear has an unaidable hearing loss and the other ear has normal or aidable hearing, often complain of difficulties understanding speech and localizing sound sources, and report a higher self-perceived hearing disability. Patients with SSD may benefit from using contralateral routing of signal (CROS) or bilateral contralateral routing of the signal (BiCROS) amplification. Dissatisfaction of previously available (Bi)CROS devices has been reported, such as, interfering transmissions, low-fidelity sound quality, poor &quot;user-friendly&quot; set-up, and a bulky and cosmetically cumbersome appearance.PURPOSE: Recent advances in hearing aid technology have improved (Bi)CROS hearing aids; however, these devices have not been experimentally evaluated. We hypothesized that newer technology with reports of improved digital signal processing, wireless transmission, and physical design would be as good, or better than, our participants' previous-generation BiCROS systems.RESEARCH DESIGN: A within-subjects, pretest-posttest design was executed.STUDY SAMPLE: Thirty-nine veterans (one female, 38 males; mean age = 74 yr, range = 49-85 yr) from the Audiology Section of the Bay Pines Veterans Affair Healthcare System participated. All participants were previously experienced BiCROS hearing aid users with varying degrees of sensorinerual hearing impairment in their better ear.INTERVENTION: Participants were provided at least 4 wk of consistent use with the new BiCROS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSES: Participants completed three research visits. At Visit 1, with their previous BiCROS, and at Visit 3, with their new BiCROS, the following objective and subjective measures were obtained: (1) soundfield speech-in-noise testing using the Words-In-Noise (WIN) test; (2) speech, spatial, and qualities of the hearing scale (SSQ) questionnaire; (3) selected questions from the MarkeTrak questionnaire; and, (4) three open-ended questions. Data were analyzed using parametric and nonparametric statistics.RESULTS: Overall, the objective (WIN) and subjective (SSQ, MarkeTrak, and open-ended questions) measures indicated that the new BiCROS provided better outcomes than the previous BiCROS system. In addition, an overlap of favorable results was seen across measures.CONCLUSIONS: Of the 39 participants, 95% reported improvements with the new BiCROS and chose to utilize the device regularly. The favorable objective and subjective outcomes indicate that the new BiCROS system is as good, or better than, what was previously utilized by our sample of veterans."
"23072178","Presbycusis, part 1: can you hear the music of life?","We used a novel approach allowing participants in this study to self-monitor their hearing sensitivity to familiar sounds in the environment. The objective of this approach was to establish whether participants in the 80-89 and 90-99 age groups would recognize the degree of their hearing impairment. It was our hope that participants would value audiology treatment and that it would improve their quality of life over a short period. The pilot study took place in a clinical environment where participants answered survey questions before and after audiology treatment, which pertained to their hearing impairment, morale, social support, and life satisfaction. Caregivers were included in the research to rate and record participants' problem behaviors (e.g., shouting, anger, agitation, repetitive speech dialog, and depression) before, during, and after treatment. This research validates other scientists' findings that annoying problem behaviors may actually be the result of hearing loss because of a person's inability to recognize speech. The pilot study shows that participants with mild dementia adapted well to speech and sounds in the natural environment without agitation as well as to management of hearing aids within a 30-day period. The participants with moderate dementia were slower to adapt. All participants with dementia required the cooperation of their caregivers to maintain hygiene of ear canals and hearing aids and insertion. This study suggests that the sooner people receive treatment for hearing loss, the quicker they are to recognize speech and to master hearing aid technology."
"22928919","Speech recognition in noise using bilateral open-fit hearing aids: the limited benefit of directional microphones and noise reduction.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate speech recognition performance in noise with bilateral open-fit hearing aids and as reference also with closed earmolds, in omnidirectional mode, directional mode, and directional mode in conjunction with noise reduction.DESIGN: A within-subject design with repeated measures across conditions was used. Speech recognition thresholds in noise were obtained for the different conditions.STUDY SAMPLE: Twenty adults without prior experience with hearing aids. All had symmetric sensorineural mild hearing loss in the lower frequencies and moderate to severe hearing loss in the higher frequencies.RESULTS: Speech recognition performance in noise was not significantly better with an omnidirectional microphone compared to unaided, whereas performance was significantly better with a directional microphone (1.6 dB with open fitting and 4.4 dB with closed earmold) compared to unaided. With open fitting, no significant additional advantage was obtained by combining the directional microphone with a noise reduction algorithm, but with closed earmolds a significant additional advantage of 0.8 dB was obtained.CONCLUSIONS: The significant, though limited, advantage of directional microphones and the absence of additional significant improvement by a noise reduction algorithm should be considered when fitting open-fit hearing aids."
"22731922","Acceptable noise level (ANL) with Danish and non-semantic speech materials in adult hearing-aid users.","OBJECTIVE: The acceptable noise level (ANL) test is used for quantification of the amount of background noise subjects accept when listening to speech. This study investigates Danish hearing-aid users' ANL performance using Danish and non-semantic speech signals, the repeatability of ANL, and the association between ANL and outcome of the international outcome inventory for hearing aids (IOI-HA).DESIGN: ANL was measured in three conditions in both ears at two test sessions. Subjects completed the IOI-HA and the ANL questionnaire.STUDY SAMPLE: Sixty-three Danish hearing-aid users; fifty-seven subjects were full time users and 6 were part time/non users of hearing aids according to the ANL questionnaire.RESULTS: ANLs were similar to results with American English speech material. The coefficient of repeatability (CR) was 6.5-8.8 dB. IOI-HA scores were not associated to ANL.CONCLUSIONS: Danish and non-semantic ANL versions yield results similar to the American English version. The magnitude of the CR indicates that ANL with Danish and non-semantic speech materials is not suitable for prediction of individual patterns of future hearing-aid use or evaluation of individual benefit from hearing-aid features. The ANL with Danish and non-semantic speech materials is not related to IOI-HA outcome."

Respondents identified with one of four levels of functional hearing ability and selected from descriptions of workplace accommodations. Each selection was ranked according to perceived importance, satisfaction and frequency of use. Respondents also commented on unmet needs.RESULTS: The most common accommodations were telephone aids (55%), co-worker helps (34%) and electronic communication (31%). Importance and frequency of use ranked high among most respondents (76% and 87%, respectively). However, perceived satisfaction ranked high among only 50% of respondents. The most common unmet needs were effective communication in groups and lack of co-worker support.CONCLUSIONS: Workplace accommodations are viewed as important and frequently used by individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. However, satisfaction with the accommodations is marginal at best. Unmet needs remain in the areas of communication in meetings, support of co-workers and the development of a more universally accessible workplace environment."
"24099584","Acceptable noise level (ANL) and real-world hearing-aid success in Taiwanese listeners.","OBJECTIVE: The objective of this prospective study was to investigate the relationship between acceptable noise level (ANL), which was measured using Taiwanese and the international speech test signal (ISTS), and real-world hearing-aid success for listeners who were representative of the population commonly seen in clinics.DESIGN: Unaided ANLs were measured pre-hearing-aid fitting. Hearing-aid success was assessed three months post-fitting using the international outcome inventory for hearing aids (IOI-HA) and a hearing-aid use questionnaire.STUDY SAMPLE: Eighty adults with hearing impairment completed the study.RESULTS: Both Taiwanese and ISTS ANLs were significantly associated with hearing-aid success, with higher ANLs suggesting poorer outcomes. However, the ANL's prediction accuracy for the probability of hearing-aid success was either much lower than that suggested by some literature, or was not much different from that of simply predicting all listeners as successful users.CONCLUSIONS: The current study suggested the possibility of using ANL to predict hearing-aid success. However, the usefulness of ANL as a clinical tool is unlikely to be as great as indicated by the literature."
"23654396","Effect of spectral change enhancement for the hearing impaired using parameter values selected with a genetic algorithm.","Chen et al. [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 131, 2987-2998 (2012)] evaluated the effectiveness of an algorithm for enhancing spectral changes over time in improving the intelligibility of speech in background sounds for hearing-impaired subjects. The processing improved intelligibility for speech in steady speech-spectrum noise (SSN) but tended to impair intelligibility in a background of two-talker speech (TTS). Large individual differences were found. The present study assessed whether the effectiveness of the algorithm was improved when the parameters that controlled the degree and type of enhancement were chosen individually for each subject, using a genetic algorithm based on subjective preferences for speech clarity. The parameter values selected by the genetic algorithm varied markedly across subjects. Speech intelligibility was measured for unprocessed stimuli and stimuli processed using the selected parameters, with SSN and TTS maskers and two signal-to-masker ratios (SMRs) for each subject. The intelligibility of speech in the SSN masker at the lower SMR was improved about 14 percentage points by the processing. The overall improvement produced by the processing was significantly larger than the improvement observed in the previous study when the parameter values were fixed across subjects, indicating that use of the genetic algorithm was beneficial."
"23575461","Real-life efficacy and reliability of training a hearing aid.","OBJECTIVES: Commercial trainable hearing aids (HA) (i.e., devices that for a period are adjusted by the user in different acoustic environments and that subsequently with changing environments automatically adapt to the user's preferred settings), are readily available; however, little information exists about the efficacy of training a HA. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and reliability of training a HA in everyday environments.DESIGN: The participants were 26 hearing-impaired volunteers with a median age of 79 years and an average pure-tone average of 53 dB HL. Test devices were commercial, multimemory, prototype devices that enabled training of the compression characteristics in four frequency bands and in six sound classes. Participants wore the National Acoustic Laboratories nonlinear fitting procedure version 2 prescription for 3 weeks and trained the devices from the prescribed response for 3 weeks, before comparing their trained response with the prescription for 2 weeks. The devices were reset to the prescription, and 19 participants repeated the training and comparison trials. During the comparison trial, participants made daily diary ratings of their satisfaction with the programs, and a structured interview was completed at the end of the comparison trial.RESULTS: The participants displayed different needs for changing the prescription, with more daily adjustments leading to training across more sound classes. Unreliable observations were obtained from 8 participants after each of the test and retest comparison trials. Of the 10 participants who made sufficient changes to the prescription during the first trial, 80% preferred their trained response. The 8 &quot;low trainers&quot; reported no preference, and also reported lower overall satisfaction with the device. Fewer adjustments were made during the repeat trial, resulting in less training. Significant correlations between trained variations were seen for 63% of 19 participants. Of the 10 participants who provided valid data after both comparison trials, those who trained the device consistently generally showed consistent preferences, and vice versa.CONCLUSIONS: For those who wanted a change to the prescription, training was mostly effective. Limited data on reliability showed reasonable consistency in training outcomes and preferences. Findings, in particular on reliability, should be verified in larger populations. A guideline on how to clinically manage training with clients is presented."

"23357806","Comparison of multichannel wide dynamic range compression and ChannelFree processing in open canal hearing instruments.","BACKGROUND: Multichannel wide dynamic range compression (WDRC) and ChannelFree processing have similar goals yet differ significantly in terms of signal processing. Multichannel WDRC devices divide the input signal into separate frequency bands; a separate level is determined within each frequency band; and compression in each band is based on the level within each band. ChannelFree processing detects the wideband level, and gain adjustments are based on the wideband signal level and adjusted up to 20,000 times per second. Although both signal processing strategies are currently available in hearing aids, it is unclear if differences in these signal processing strategies affect the performance and/or preference of the end user.PURPOSE: The purpose of the research was to determine the effects of multichannel wide dynamic range compression and ChannelFree processing on performance and/or preference of listeners using open-canal hearing instruments.RESEARCH DESIGN: An experimental study in which subjects were exposed to a repeated measures design was utilized.STUDY SAMPLE: Fourteen adult listeners with mild sloping to moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss participated (mean age 67 yr).DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Participants completed two 5 wk trial periods for each signal processing strategy. Probe microphone, behavioral and subjective measures were conducted unaided and aided at the end of each trial period.RESULTS: Behavioral and subjective results for both signal processing strategies were significantly better than unaided results; however, behavioral and subjective results were not significantly different between the signal processing strategies.CONCLUSIONS: Multichannel WDRC and ChannelFree processing are both effective signal processing strategies that provide significant benefit for hearing instrument users. Overall preference between the strategies may be related to the degree of hearing loss of the user, high-frequency in-situ levels, and/or acceptance of background noise."
"25382428","Open fitting: performance verification of receiver in the ear and receiver in the aid.","OBJECTIVE: To verify the receiver in the ear and receiver in the aid adaptations by measuring in situ the speech perception and users' level of satisfaction.METHODS: The study was approved by the research ethics committee (Process: 027/2011). Twenty subjects older than 18 years with audiological diagnosis of mild and moderate bilateral descending sensorineural hearing loss were evaluated. The subjects were divided into two groups, where G1 (group 1) was fitted with open-fit hearing aids with the built-in receiver unit (receiver in the ear) and G2 (group 2) was fitted with open-fit hearing aids with RITE. A probe microphone measurement was performed to check the gain and output provided by the amplification and for assessment of speech perception with Hearing in Noise Test with and without hearing aids. After a period of six weeks of use without interruption, the subjects returned for follow-up and answered the Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life questionnaire, and were again subjected to Hearing in Noise Test.RESULTS: Both groups presented better test results for speech recognition in the presence of noise.CONCLUSION: Groups 1 and 2 were satisfied with the use of hearing aids and improved speech recognition in silent and noisy situations with hearing aids."
"25262671","Perceptions of adults with hearing impairment regarding the promotion of trust in hearing healthcare service delivery.","OBJECTIVE: This paper describes how trust is promoted in adults with hearing impairment within the context of hearing healthcare (HHC) service delivery.DESIGN: Data were analysed from a previously published descriptive qualitative study that explored perspectives of adults with hearing impairment on hearing help-seeking and rehabilitation.STUDY SAMPLE: Interview transcripts from 29 adults from four countries with different levels of hearing impairment and different experience with the HHC system were analysed thematically.RESULTS: Patients enter into the HHC system with service expectations resulting in a preconceived level of trust that can vary from low to high. Relational competence, technical competence, commercialized approach, and clinical environment (relevant to both the clinician and the clinic) influence a patient's resulting level of trust.CONCLUSIONS: Trust is evolving rather than static in HHC: Both clinicians and clinics can promote trust. The characteristics of HHC that engender trust are: practicing good communication, supporting shared decision making, displaying technical competence, offering comprehensive hearing rehabilitation, promoting self-management, avoiding a focus on hearing-aid sales, and offering a professional clinic setting."
"24751499","Managing age-related hearing loss: how to use hearing aids efficiently - a mini-review.","Using hearing aids may contribute to better functioning in the everyday lives of hearing-impaired older individuals. We introduce an integrative concept for the efficient use of hearing aids that involves both satisfaction with, and behaviour towards, hearing aids. We review theoretical and empirical work on the predictors of the efficient use of hearing aids in everyday life. Furthermore, we contend that the use of hearing aids requires improved understanding of the variability of hearing demands within specific contexts of everyday life (e.g. conversation with family members, listening to music). The efficiency of hearing aid use thus depends on the fit of situational demands, personal resources, and the specific configuration of the hearing aid device. We propose an integrative person-environment-fit model that advances concepts of selection, optimisation, and compensation to hearing aid efficiency. We discuss the implications of this model for research and for practitioners in the field of gerontology."
"24687593","Effect of a Bluetooth-implemented hearing aid on speech recognition performance: subjective and objective measurement.","OBJECTIVES: The object was to evaluate speech perception improvement through Bluetooth-implemented hearing aids in hearing-impaired adults.METHODS: Thirty subjects with bilateral symmetric moderate sensorineural hearing loss participated in this study. A Bluetooth-implemented hearing aid was fitted unilaterally in all study subjects. Objective speech recognition score and subjective satisfaction were measured with a Bluetooth-implemented hearing aid to replace the acoustic connection from either a cellular phone or a loudspeaker system. In each system, participants were assigned to 4 conditions: wireless speech signal transmission into hearing aid (wireless mode) in quiet or noisy environment and conventional speech signal transmission using external microphone of hearing aid (conventional mode) in quiet or noisy environment. Also, participants completed questionnaires to investigate subjective satisfaction.RESULTS: Both cellular phone and loudspeaker system situation, participants showed improvements in sentence and word recognition scores with wireless mode compared to conventional mode in both quiet and noise conditions (P &lt; .001). Participants also reported subjective improvements, including better sound quality, less noise interference, and better accuracy naturalness, when using the wireless mode (P &lt; .001).CONCLUSIONS: Bluetooth-implemented hearing aids helped to improve subjective and objective speech recognition performances in quiet and noisy environments during the use of electronic audio devices."
"24384083","Sentence recognition in noise and perceived benefit of noise reduction on the receiver and transmitter sides of a BICROS hearing aid.","BACKGROUND: In the past, bilateral contralateral routing of signals (BICROS) amplification incorporated omnidirectional microphones on the transmitter and receiver sides and some models utilized noise reduction (NR) on the receiver side. Little research has examined the performance of BICROS amplification in background noise. However, previous studies examining contralateral routing of signals (CROS) amplification have reported that the presence of background noise on the transmitter side negatively affected speech recognition. Recently, NR was introduced as a feature on the receiver and transmitter sides of BICROS amplification, which has the potential to decrease the impact of noise on the wanted speech signal by decreasing unwanted noise directed to the transmitter side.PURPOSE: The primary goal of this study was to examine differences in the reception threshold for sentences (RTS in dB) using the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) in a diffuse listening environment between unaided and three aided BICROS conditions (no NR, mild NR, and maximum NR) in the Tandem 16 BICROS. A secondary goal was to examine real-world subjective impressions of the Tandem 16 BICROS compared to unaided.RESEARCH DESIGN: A randomized block repeated measures single blind design was used to assess differences between no NR, mild NR, and maximum NR listening conditions.STUDY SAMPLE: Twenty-one adult participants with asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss (ASNHL) and experience with BICROS amplification were recruited from Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Participants were fit with the National Acoustic Laboratories' Nonlinear version 1 prescriptive target (NAL-NL1) with the Tandem 16 BICROS at the initial visit and then verified using real-ear insertion gain (REIG) measures. Participants acclimatized to the Tandem 16 BICROS for 4 wk before returning for final testing. Participants were tested utilizing HINT sentences examining differences in RTS between unaided and three aided listening conditions. Subjective benefit was determined via the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) questionnaire between the Tandem 16 BICROS and unaided. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilized to analyze the results of the HINT and APHAB.RESULTS: Results revealed no significant differences in the RTS between unaided, no NR, mild NR, and maximum NR. Subjective impressions using the APHAB revealed statistically and clinically significant benefit with the Tandem 16 BICROS compared to unaided for the Ease of Communication (EC), Background Noise (BN), and Reverberation (RV) subscales.CONCLUSIONS: The RTS was not significantly different between unaided, no NR, mild NR, and maximum NR. None of the three aided listening conditions were significantly different from unaided performance as has been reported for previous studies examining CROS hearing aids. Further, based on comments from participants and previous research studies with conventional hearing aids, manufacturers of BICROS amplification should consider incorporating directional microphones and independent volume controls on the receiver and transmitter sides to potentially provide further improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for patients with ASNHL."
"26449672","[Hearing aid fitting: Effect of doubling the standard rate on compliance, quality of results, and excess payments].","BACKGROUND: This study investigates the effect that doubling the standard rate for hearing aid fitting which is covered by statutory insurance has had on the size of excess payments and compliance, as well as on benefits for patients and their satisfaction.METHODS: In April 2014, 859 members of a statutory insurance scheme (hkk) who received hearing aids in the 6 months prior to the reform were questioned on the timing and financial details of their hearing aid fitting, as well as on treatment compliance and quality of the results using a standardized questionnaire. In October 2014, the same questionnaire was used to collect these data from a further 622 insurance holders who had received hearing aids in the 8 months following introduction of the new regulation. Most of the questions concerning hearing quality corresponded to those of the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) questionnaire.RESULTS: The project revealed a statistically significant decrease of 6 percent points in the proportion of hearing aid users who had to pay any excess whatsoever; from 80.6% to 74.1%. However, 40% of the insured persons continued to pay an excess of 1000 euros and more. The subjective hearing quality remained practically unimproved by the reform and was statistically, almost without exception, independent of whether hearing aid users wore expensive devices associated with a large excess, or devices available at the standard rate. Finally, the study confirmed a previously recognized usage pattern characterized by noncompliance. For example, approximately 40% of hearing aid users did not wear their device in the everyday environment. This observation was independent of the size of the excess and the timing of the most recent visit to the hearing aid acoustician.CONCLUSION: Despite doubling of the standard rate, three quarters of patients pay an excess--sometimes a substantial one. The subjective hearing quality was not improved by doubling the standard rate; the majority of patients continue to complain of considerable problems with hearing in difficult situations (environments with background or reverberant noise). Satisfaction with hearing quality is neither dependent on the doubling of the standard rate, nor on whether or not an excess was paid. Compliance may possibly be improved by structured follow-up, which should involve the prescribing otorhinolaryngologists, as well as phoniatrists, pedaudiologists, and hearing aid acousticians."
"26268631","Background sounds and hearing-aid users: A scoping review.","OBJECTIVES: A scoping review focused on background sounds and adult hearing-aid users, including aspects of aversiveness and interference. The aim was to establish the current body of knowledge, identify knowledge gaps, and to suggest possible future directions for research.DESIGN: Data were gathered using a systematic search strategy, consistent with scoping review methodology.STUDY SAMPLE: Searches of public databases between 1988 and 2014 returned 1182 published records. After exclusions for duplicates and out-of- scope works, 75 records remained for further analysis. Content analysis was used to group the records into five separate themes.RESULTS: Content analysis indicated numerous themes relating to background sounds. Five broad emergent themes addressed the development and validation of outcome instruments, satisfaction surveys, assessments of hearing-aid technology and signal processing, acclimatization to the device post-fitting, and non-auditory influences on benefit and satisfaction.CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of hearing-aid users still find particular hearing-aid features and attributes dissatisfying when listening in background sounds. Many conclusions are limited by methodological drawbacks in study design and too many different outcome instruments. Future research needs to address these issues, while controlling for hearing-aid fitting."
"26055837","Effects of Training on the Use of a Manual Microphone Shutoff on a BiCROS Device.","BACKGROUND: Bilateral contralateral routing of signals (BiCROS) hearing aids function to restore audibility of sounds originating from the side of the unaidable ear. However, when speech is presented to the side of the aidable ear and noise to the side of the unaidable ear, a BiCROS arrangement may reduce intelligibility of the speech signal. This negative effect may be circumvented if an on/off switch is available on the contralateral routing of signals (CROS) transmitter.PURPOSE: This study evaluated if the proper use of the on/off switch on a CROS transmitter could enhance speech recognition in noise and sound localization abilities. The participants' subjective reactions to the use of the BiCROS, including the use of the on/off switch in real-life were also evaluated.RESEARCH DESIGN: A between-subjects, repeated-measures design was used to assess differences in speech recognition (in quiet and in noise) and localization abilities under four hearing aid conditions (unaided, unilaterally aided, fixed BiCROS setting, and adjusted BiCROS setting) with speech and noise stimuli presented from different azimuths. Participants were trained on the use of the on/off switch on the BiCROS transmitter before testing in the adjusted BiCROS settings. Subjective ratings were obtained with the Speech, Spatial, and Sound Quality (SSQ) questionnaire and a custom questionnaire.STUDY SAMPLE: Nine adult BiCROS candidates participated in this study.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Participants wore the Widex Dream-m-CB hearing aid on the aidable ear for 1 week. They then wore the BiCROS for the remainder of the study. Speech recognition and localization testing were completed in four hearing aid conditions (unaided, unilateral aided, fixed BiCROS, and adjusted BiCROS). Speech recognition was evaluated during the first three visits, whereas localization was evaluated over the course of the study. Participants completed the SSQ questionnaire before each visit. The CROS questionnaire was completed at the final visit. A repeated measures analysis of variance with Bonferroni post hoc analysis was used to evaluate the significance of the results on speech recognition, localization, and the SSQ.RESULTS: The results revealed that the adjusted BiCROS condition improved speech recognition scores by 20 rau (rationalized arcsine unit) when speech was presented to the aidable ear and localization by 37% when sounds are presented from the side of the unaidable ear over the fixed BiCROS condition. Statistically significant benefit on the SSQ was also noted with the adjusted BiCROS condition compared to the unilateral fitting.CONCLUSIONS: These findings supported the value of an on/off switch on a CROS transmitter because it allows convenient selective transmission of sounds. It also highlighted the importance of instructions and practice in using the BiCROS hearing aid successfully."

Hearing loss impairs communication skills. Objective To evaluate the level of user satisfaction with hearing aids. Methods This is a cross-sectional group study comprising 108 subjects (56% men and 44% women). The average age of the subjects was 77 years. These subjects had been recently fitted with their hearing aids and showed sensorineural (90%) and mixed (10%) hearing loss as determined via the Questionnaire International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids Outcome Inventory (IOI-HA), which determined the benefit and satisfaction obtained by sound amplification. Results The hearing aids improved the quality of life of 52.78% of the patients, which was revealed by their high scores (mean<U+2009>=<U+2009>27.3). The relationship of the user with the environment was significantly better (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) than that of the user with the hearing aid. Conclusion IOI-HA is a simple and easy-to-use tool. Based on the results of this study, we can show a high degree of satisfaction with their hearing aids in the majority of the participants, which improved the quality of life. "
"25924663","Hearing aid or tinnitus masker: which one is the best treatment for blast-induced tinnitus? The results of a long-term study on 974 patients.","The aim of this longitudinal study was to explore whether a hearing aid or noise generator would be an effective audiological treatment for blast-induced chronic tinnitus. The amount of satisfaction from different hearing devices (hearing aid, noise generator, or both) during different time periods (1, 6, 12 and 24 months after fitting) was assessed. The 974 subjects enrolled in this study were Iran-Iraq war veterans, suffering from tinnitus for at least 2 years. About 84% of the subjects preferred just a hearing aid. Only 2.7% chose the noise generator, and the others preferred to use both devices. There were no significant differences between the hearing thresholds of the 3 groups. The satisfaction score for the hearing aid and combined devices increased by time but decreased for the noise generator. There was no correlation between the satisfaction score and parameters such as hearing thresholds, audiogram configuration and tinnitus pitch. We concluded that, compared with a noise generator, the most long-lasting treatment for blast-induced tinnitus is a hearing aid. The possible cause for such a performance is probably the recovery of the auditory function and neuroplasticity through the hearing aid."
"25885193","Self-reported outcomes after hearing aid fitting in Minas Gerais, Brazil.","PURPOSE: To analyze the self-reported outcomes after hearing aid fitting among individuals in the northern region of Minas Gerais and associated factors.METHODS: A cross-sectional and analytical study with a random sample of adults and elderly attending the public health care service was conducted in the northern region of Minas Gerais (86 municipalities), Brazil. Study's participants answered International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA) questionnaires. Data were analyzed descriptively and analytically with Poisson regression analysis.RESULTS: We interviewed 272 adults and 112 individuals reported not using their hearing aids regularly. The mean of IOI-HA global score was lower than expected. The individual's relationship with their hearing aid (Factor 1) was worse than the individual's relationship with their environment (Factor 2). Lower global scores were statistically associated with no work.CONCLUSIONS: The observed scores for the study's population are lower than those recorded in other studies. The results suggest that there are limitations in the fitting and follow-up of individuals who received hearing aids."
"25690777","Estimation of Signal-to-Noise Ratios in Realistic Sound Scenarios.","BACKGROUND: Both in the design of hearing-device features, such as noise reduction, and in the evaluation measurements of such features, there is a need for more information about the sound scenarios hearing-device users encounter. The limitations of adaptive speech tests as outcome measures in the evaluation of hearing-device features have been discussed. The obvious alternative to adaptive speech testing is to test at a fixed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, the question is which SNRs should be used if the test reflects real-life situations.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to estimate SNRs in realistic sound environments encountered by hearing aid users.RESEARCH DESIGN: Research design was a descriptive study where recorded sound files were statistically analyzed.STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 20 experienced, bilaterally fitted hearing aid users, all satisfied with their current hearing aids, made recordings for 3-4 days. The informants were instructed to record different situations in daily life and were told that all situations were of equal importance. The informants ranged in age from 18-81 yr old, and they had various occupations and varying hearing-loss configurations.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The total duration of the recorded material for each informant was, on average, 84 min; the number of recordings was, on average, 17 per informant. The sound files were categorized based on the type of background noise and were analyzed with use of a manual noise estimation procedure. Segments of speech with noise present were cut out from the original recordings. Corresponding noise-only segments were also extracted. On the basis of power calculations for these two types of recorded segments, the SNR was estimated. Frequency-specific and overall SNRs, calculated both based on unweighted and A-weighted speech and noise levels, were derived. An estimation uncertainty measure was also developed.RESULTS: The range of SNRs found in the material was large. The most striking finding was that there were very few recorded situations where the SNR was negative or even close to 0 dB. For speech-in-babble noise, the average SNR was approximately 5 dB. The estimation uncertainty was generally low but became higher in highly fluctuating noises and at very low SNRs.CONCLUSIONS: The estimated SNRs were higher than previously reported. The results can be used in the design and evaluation of hearing-device features."

"28635506","An individualised acoustically transparent earpiece for hearing devices.","OBJECTIVE: An important and often still unresolved problem of hearing devices such as assistive listening devices and hearing aids is limited user acceptance - a primary reason is poor conservation quality of the acoustic environment. Approaching a possible solution to this problem, an earpiece prototype is presented and evaluated. The prototype is individually and automatically calibrated in situ to provide acoustical transparency, i.e., achieving an audio perception alike to the open ear.DESIGN: A comprehensive evaluation was performed, comprising technical measurements on an advanced dummy head and listening tests, in which listeners directly compared sound perception through the prototype and a simulated open ear canal reference.STUDY SAMPLE: Ten normal hearing subjects, including five expert listeners, participated in the listening test.RESULTS: The technical evaluation verified good achievement of acoustical transparency. The psychoacoustic results showed that a reliable distinction between the two conditions presented was not possible for relevant communication sounds.CONCLUSION: The prototype can be described as an initial realisation of an acoustically transparent hearing system, i.e. a device that does not disturb the perception of external sounds. In further developments, the device can be considered as the basis for systems integrating high sound quality, hearing support and other desired modifications."

The MarkeTrak VIII reported that 42% of hearing aid wearers are not satisfied with the performance of their hearing aids in situations where wind is present.PURPOSE: The current study investigated the effect of a new wind noise attenuation (WNA) algorithm on subjective annoyance and speech recognition in the presence of wind.RESEARCH DESIGN: A single-blinded, repeated measures design was used.STUDY SAMPLE: Fifteen experienced hearing aid wearers with bilaterally symmetrical (=10 dB) mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss participated in the study.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Subjective rating for wind noise annoyance was measured for wind presented alone from 0 and 290 at wind speeds of 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10 m/sec. Phoneme identification performance was measured using Widex Office of Clinical Amplification Nonsense Syllable Test presented at 60, 65, 70, and 75 dB SPL from 270 in the presence of wind originating from 0 at a speed of 5 m/sec.RESULTS: The subjective annoyance from wind noise was reduced for wind originating from 0 at wind speeds from 4 to 7 m/sec. The largest improvement in phoneme identification with the WNA algorithm was 48.2% when speech was presented from 270 at 65 dB SPL and the wind originated from 0 azimuth at 5 m/sec.CONCLUSION: The WNA algorithm used in this study reduced subjective annoyance for wind speeds ranging from 4 to 7 m/sec. The algorithm was effective in improving speech identification in the presence of wind originating from 0 at 5 m/sec. These results suggest that the WNA algorithm used in the current study could expand the range of real-life situations where a hearing-impaired person can use the hearing aid optimally."
