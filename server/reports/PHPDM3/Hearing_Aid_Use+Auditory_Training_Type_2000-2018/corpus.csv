"14968699","Auditory function in a group of adults infected with HIV/AIDS in Gauteng, South Africa.","Numerous international studies have demonstrated a relationship between HIV/AIDS and auditory function. The aim of this study was to explore this relationship in a group of adults infected with HIV/AIDS attending an outpatient clinic in a hospital located in Gauteng, South Africa. The prevalence of hearing loss; the type, degree and configuration of the hearing loss; the relationship between the hearing symptoms and the progressive stages of the disease, and the type of onset of hearing problems were examined. The results of the study indicated a prevalence rate of hearing loss which was as high as 23% in the sample surveyed. The types of hearing loss included conductive and sensorineural, while the degree of severity ranged from slight to profound in nature. The configuration of the hearing loss was not frequency-range-specific, and the degree of severity did not seem to worsen with the progression of the HIV/AIDS disease. However, there did seem to be an increase in the occurrence of sensorineural hearing loss with the deterioration of patients' immunological status. Analysis of patients' audiological results along with their case history data suggested that their hearing loss may have been caused by opportunistic infections and/or their treatments. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for the clinical management of patients with HIV/AIDS; education of team members; and policy formulation."
"17125575","Can self assessment of communication predict hearing loss?","A total of 120 subjects with hearing loss (75 men, 45 women), within the age range 18-70 years (mean, 38 years), and 15 normal subjects were administered a modified Hindi adaptation of the 'self assessment of communication' hearing loss inventory. The study aimed to determine whether there was any correlation between subjects' average pure tone thresholds and their inventory scores. Data was analysed using the Pearson coefficient of correlation and regression analysis. A negative correlation was obtained stating that the greater the hearing loss, the lower the inventory score. An equation could also be derived for the bilateral symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss group and the bilateral symmetrical conductive hearing loss group to enable calculation of patients' average hearing loss from their inventory scores, in the absence of an audiogram. This could aid rehabilitation in cases with either type of hearing loss (in which no medical intervention was required) when pure tone audiometry is not possible."

To test this prediction, we changed the compression release settings in the hearing instruments of experienced users and allowed them to train for 9 weeks with the new settings. After training, aided speech recognition in noise was tested with both the trained settings and orthogonal settings. We postulated that training would lead to acclimatization to the trained setting, which in turn would involve establishment of new phonological representations in long-term memory. Further, we postulated that after training, testing with orthogonal settings would give rise to phonological mismatch, associated with more explicit cognitive processing.DESIGN: Thirty-two participants (mean=70.3 years, SD=7.7) with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (pure-tone average=46.0 dB HL, SD=6.5), bilaterally fitted for more than 1 year with digital, two-channel, nonlinear signal processing hearing instruments and chosen from the patient population at the Linköping University Hospital were randomly assigned to 9 weeks training with new, fast (40 ms) or slow (640 ms), compression release settings in both channels. Aided speech recognition in noise performance was tested according to a design with three within-group factors: test occasion (T1, T2), test setting (fast, slow), and type of noise (unmodulated, modulated) and one between-group factor: experience setting (fast, slow) for two types of speech materials-the highly constrained Hagerman sentences and the less-predictable Hearing in Noise Test (HINT). Complex cognitive capacity was measured using the reading span and letter monitoring tests. PREDICTION: We predicted that speech recognition in noise at T2 with mismatched experience and test settings would be associated with more explicit cognitive processing and thus stronger correlations with complex cognitive measures, as well as poorer performance if complex cognitive capacity was exceeded.RESULTS: Under mismatch conditions, stronger correlations were found between performance on speech recognition with the Hagerman sentences and reading span, along with poorer speech recognition for participants with low reading span scores. No consistent mismatch effect was found with HINT.CONCLUSIONS: The mismatch prediction generated by the working memory framework for Ease of Language Understanding is supported for speech recognition in noise with the highly constrained Hagerman sentences but not the less-predictable HINT."
"18278221","Group follow up proposal for elderly with hearing aids.","Implementing rehabilitation programs to hearing impaired adults is of great importance, mainly in the elderly population, and it is necessary to add them to the routine of outpatient care programs.</AbstractText>: Implementing rehabilitation programs to hearing impaired adults is of great importance, mainly in the elderly population, and it is necessary to add them to the routine of outpatient care programs.AIM: to present a group care program for elderly patients who are fitted with hearing aids.MATERIAL AND METHOD: to carry out a pilot study of clinical and experimental type, with the participation of 40 elderly users of hearing aids donated by the government, distributed within six groups, with maximum of eight participants jointly with their respective companions. Program consisted of three meetings every fifteen days, where information and education on the proper use hearing aids was transmitted.RESULTS: Most of the patients participated actively in the meetings spontaneously giving their opinion or answering questions when so requested. All elderly had been informed as to the importance of accepting their auditory deficiency and on the need to be motivated towards using hearing aids. Moreover, listening to depositions of other elderly users seemed to facilitate understanding of their own difficulties and stimulated them in the process of getting used to the sound amplification.CONCLUSION: Groups structure facilitated interaction among aged ones, helping them to clarify communication doubts and strategies and, consequently, it promoted their adaptation."
"19764167","Efficacy of linear frequency transposition on consonant identification in quiet and in noise.","BACKGROUND: Frequency transposition has gained renewed interest in recent years. This type of processing takes sounds in the unaidable high-frequency region and moves them to the lower frequency region. One concern is that the transposed sounds mask or distort the original low-frequency sounds and lead to a poorer performance. On the other hand, experience with transposition may allow the listeners to relearn the new auditory percepts and benefit from transposition.PURPOSE: The current study was designed to examine the effect of linear frequency transposition on consonant identification in quiet (50 dB SPL and 68 dB SPL) and in noise at three intervals--the initial fit, after one month of use (along with auditory training), and a further one month of use (without directed training) of transposition.RESEARCH DESIGN: A single-blind, factorial repeated-measures design was used to study the effect of test conditions (three) and hearing aid setting/time interval (four) on consonant identification.STUDY SAMPLE: Eight adults with a severe-to-profound high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss participated.INTERVENTION: Participants were fit with the Widex m4-m behind-the-ear hearing aids binaurally in the frequency transposition mode, and their speech scores were measured initially. They wore the hearing aids home for one month and were instructed to complete a self-paced &quot;bottom-up&quot; training regimen. They returned after the training, and their speech performance was measured. They wore the hearing aids home for another month, but they were not instructed to complete any auditory training. Their speech performance was again measured at the end of the two-month trial.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Consonant performance was measured with a nonsense syllable test (ORCA-NST) that was developed at this facility (Office of Research in Clinical Amplification [Widex]). The test conditions included testing in quiet at 50 dB SPL and 68 dB SPL, and at 68 dB SPL in noise (SNR [signal-to-noise ratio] = +5). The hearing aid conditions included no transposition at initial fit (V1), transposition at initial fit (V2), transposition at one month post-fit (V3), and transposition at 2 months post-fit (V4). Identification scores were analyzed for each individual phoneme and phonemic class. Repeated-measures ANOVA were conducted using SPSS software to examine significant differences.RESULTS: For all test conditions (50 dB SPL in quiet, 68 dB SPL in quiet, and 68 dB SPL in noise), a statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.05 level) was reached between the transposition condition measured at two months postfitting and the initial fitting (with and without transposition) for fricatives only. The difference between transposition and the no-transposition conditions at the 50 dB SPL condition was also significant for the initial and one-month intervals. Analysis of individual phonemes showed a decrease in the number of confusions and an increase in the number of correct identification over time.CONCLUSIONS: Linear frequency transposition improved fricative identification over time. Proper candidate selection with appropriate training is necessary to fully realize the potential benefit of this type of processing."
"23654396","Effect of spectral change enhancement for the hearing impaired using parameter values selected with a genetic algorithm.","Chen et al. [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 131, 2987-2998 (2012)] evaluated the effectiveness of an algorithm for enhancing spectral changes over time in improving the intelligibility of speech in background sounds for hearing-impaired subjects. The processing improved intelligibility for speech in steady speech-spectrum noise (SSN) but tended to impair intelligibility in a background of two-talker speech (TTS). Large individual differences were found. The present study assessed whether the effectiveness of the algorithm was improved when the parameters that controlled the degree and type of enhancement were chosen individually for each subject, using a genetic algorithm based on subjective preferences for speech clarity. The parameter values selected by the genetic algorithm varied markedly across subjects. Speech intelligibility was measured for unprocessed stimuli and stimuli processed using the selected parameters, with SSN and TTS maskers and two signal-to-masker ratios (SMRs) for each subject. The intelligibility of speech in the SSN masker at the lower SMR was improved about 14 percentage points by the processing. The overall improvement produced by the processing was significantly larger than the improvement observed in the previous study when the parameter values were fixed across subjects, indicating that use of the genetic algorithm was beneficial."
"23506666","The effect of LACE DVD training in new and experienced hearing aid users.","BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have demonstrated that improving the ability to understand speech in noise can be a difficult task for adults with hearing aids (HAs). If HA users want to improve their speech understanding ability, specific training may be needed. Auditory training (AT) is one type of intervention that may enhance speech recognition abilities for adult HA users.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the behavioral effects of an AT program called Listening and Communication Enhancement (LACE) in the DVD format in new and experienced HA users. While some research has been conducted using the computer version of this program, no research to date has been conducted on the efficacy of the DVD version of the LACE training program in both new and experienced HA users.RESEARCH DESIGN: An experimental, prospective repeated measures group design, with random assignment.STUDY SAMPLE: Twenty-nine adults with hearing loss were assigned to one of three groups: new HA plus training, experienced HA plus training, or control (new HA users with no training during the study but provided with training afterward). New HA aid users were randomly assigned to either the training or control group.INTERVENTION: Participants in the training groups completed twenty 30 min training lessons from the LACE DVD program at home over a period of 4 wk.DATA COLLECTION: Participants in both training groups were evaluated at baseline, after 2 wk of training and again after 4 wk of training. Participants in the control group were evaluated at baseline and after 4 wk of HA use. Several objective listening measures were administered including speech in noise, rapid speech, and competing sentences tasks. Subjective measures included evaluating the participants' perception of the intervention as well as their perceptions of functional listening abilities.RESULTS: Findings indicate that both new and experienced users improved their understanding of speech in noise, understanding of competing sentences, and communication function after training in comparison to a control group. Effect size calculations suggested that a larger training effect was observed for new HA users compared to experienced HA users. New HA users also reported greater benefit from training compared to experienced users. AT with the LACE DVD format should be encouraged, particularly among new HA users, to improve understanding in difficult listening conditions."
"24602838","[Auditory rehabilitation programmes for adults: what do we know about their effectiveness?].","INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Hearing loss ranks third among the health conditions that involve disability-adjusted life years. Hearing aids are the most commonly used treatment option in people with hearing loss. However, a number of auditory rehabilitation programmes have been developed with the aim of improving communicative abilities in people with hearing loss. The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness of auditory rehabilitation programmes focused on communication strategies.MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a narrative revision. A literature search using PUBMED was carried out. This search included systematic reviews investigating the effectiveness of auditory training and individual and group auditory rehabilitation programmes with the main focus on counselling and communicative strategies for adults with hearing loss. Each study was analysed in terms of the type of intervention used and the results obtained.RESULTS: Three articles were identified: one article about the effectiveness of auditory training programmes and 2 systematic reviews that investigated the effectiveness of communicative programmes in adults with hearing loss. The &quot;Active Communication Education&quot; programme appears to be an effective group programme of auditory rehabilitation that may be used with older Spanish-speaking adults.CONCLUSIONS: The utility of hearing aid fitting and communicative programmes as rehabilitation options are associated with improvements in social participation and quality of life in patients with hearing loss, especially group auditory rehabilitation programmes, which seem to have good potential for reducing activity limitations and social participation restrictions, and thus for improving patient quality of life."
"26512157","The effect of a sentence comprehension treatment on discourse comprehension in aphasia.","BACKGROUND: While it is well understood that individuals with aphasia have difficulty with discourse comprehension, very few studies have examined the nature of discourse comprehension deficits in aphasia and the potential for improvement in discourse comprehension after rehabilitation. To address the first goal, we previously developed the Test of Syntactic Effects on Discourse Comprehension (TSEDC), which provides a measure of the extent to which a participant's sentence comprehension ability aids in comprehending passages (Levy et al., 2012).AIMS: The goal of this study was to examine the effect of a sentence comprehension treatment on the TSEDC to assess if training participants to understand sentences of different syntactic complexity would improve their ability to understand passages that vary by their level of syntactic complexity.METHODS &amp; PROCEDURES: Forty participants with aphasia received sentence comprehension treatment using one of two syntactic comprehension tasks: object manipulation (OM) or sentence to picture matching (SPM). The dependent measure was improved sentence comprehension of one sentence type in one task-related protocol, with the order of task and structure counterbalanced across participants. Before and after treatment, participants also completed a self-paced auditory story comprehension task which involved 9 passages that contained either semantically reversible canonical sentences (simple passages) or semantically reversible noncanonical sentences (complex passages). At the end of each passage, participants were asked explicit or implicit questions about the story. Accuracy and reaction times were measured for each patient for each story before and after treatment.OUTCOMES &amp; RESULTS: Analysis of the treatment data revealed that participants improved in their ability to understand trained sentences (both in terms of effect size and percent change on trained structure), irrespective of whether the trained task was SPM or OM. There was no significant relationship between treatment improvements on the SPM/OM treatment (even when the task targeted in treatment was controlled for) and changes in performance on the TSEDC. Also, there was no significant improvement in TSEDC accuracy after treatment, even when various aspects of the narrative passages, including passage complexity (simple/complex), the nature of sentence type (semantically constrained/semantically reversible) and the nature of questions asked (explicit or implicit) were accounted for.CONCLUSIONS: Inherent differences between the sentence comprehension treatment and the TSEDC may have precluded generalization."
