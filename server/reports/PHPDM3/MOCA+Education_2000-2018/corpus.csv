"17328916","Mild cognitive impairment in symptomatic and asymptomatic cerebrovascular disease.","We tried to evaluate and to compare usefulness of two brief cognitive tests in early detection of cognitive decline in subjects with increased cerebrovascular (CV) risk. As CV risk factors are recognised as important in etiology of dementia, we also aimed to determine the possible associations of specific CV risk factors and cognitive results. Patients (PGs) with first-ever stroke or TIA (N=110) and CV symptoms-free controls (CGs) with CV risk factors present (N=45) matched for age, gender and education level were tested using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) on admission, at three- and six-month points. In all subjects, detailed CV risk factors profile was assessed. We observed the decrement in cognitive performance during the six-month study period in both groups, more evident if MoCA (p&lt;0.001) than if MMSE was used (p=0.022). Six months after first stroke/TIA 83.6% PGs scored below normal range on MoCA. In PGs, positive associations for cognitive decrement and multiple CV risk factors (&gt;2) were found (p=0.034 for MMSE; p=0.002 for MoCA). In CGs, positive associations were found for cognitive decrement and arterial hypertension with increased IMT values (p&lt;0.001 for MMSE) and for multiple CV risk factors and arterial hypertension (p=0.003 for MoCA). The use of MoCA could aid to early recognition of cognitive deficits in persons with increased CV risk. Individuals with multiple CV risk factors seem to have increased risk of cognitive decline."
"18850670","Cross validation of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in community dwelling older adults residing in the Southeastern US.","OBJECTIVE: Cross validation study of the MoCA for the detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in a community-based cohort residing in the Southeastern United States.METHODS: One hundred and eighteen English-speaking older adults, who underwent diagnostic evaluation as part of an on-going prospective study, were administered the MoCA and MMSE. Twenty were diagnosed with AD, 24 met criteria for amnestic MCI and 74 were considered cognitively normal. Sensitivities and specificities were calculated using the recommended cut-off scores and ROC curve analyses were performed to determine optimal sensitivity and specificity. The influence of age, education and gender on MoCA score was also examined.RESULTS: Using a cut-off score of 24 or below, the MMSE was insensitive to cognitive impairment. Using the recommended cut-off score of 26, the MoCA detected 97% of those with cognitive impairment but specificity was fair (35%). Using a lower cut-off score of 23, the MoCA exhibited excellent sensitivity (96%) and specificity (95%).CONCLUSION: The MoCA appears to have utility as a cognitive screen for early detection of AD and for MCI and warrants further investigation regarding its applicability in primary care settings, varying ethnic groups, and younger at-risk individuals."
"18474719","Brief screening for mild cognitive impairment in elderly outpatient clinic: validation of the Korean version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a brief cognitive screening tool with high sensitivity for screening patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The authors examined the validity and reliability of the Korean version of the MoCA (MoCA-K) in elderly outpatients. The MoCA-K, a Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale, and neuropsychological batteries were administered to 196 elderly persons (mild Alzheimer's disease [AD] = 44, MCI = 37, normal controls [NC] = 115). MoCA-K scores were highly correlated with those of MMSE and CDR. Using a cutoff score of 22/23, the MoCA-K had an excellent sensitivity of 89% and a good specificity of 84% for screening MCI. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were good. The results obtained show that the MoCA-K is brief, reliable, and suitable for use as a screening tool to screen MCI patients in elderly outpatient clinic settings."

The final scores for MoCA were given in the form of mean percentage distributions specific for age, sex and educational level so as to compare the validity of MMSE mini-mental state examination and MoCA in detecting MCI. By a fitting multiple regression model the influence of the factors on MMSE and MoCA was assessed.RESULTS: Using a cutoff score of 26, MMSE had a sensitivity of 24.2% to detect MCI, whereas MoCA detected 92.4% of the MCI subjects. We found a bivariate correlation between MoCA scores and both the factors of age and educational level (P &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: MoCA is a brief cognitive screening tool with high sensitivity and specificity for detecting MCI as currently conceptualized in patients performing normally on MMSE. Our adjustment in the cutoff scores would improve the detection of MCI and Alzheimer's disease by reducing the number of false negatives. MoCA scores should be used to identify current cognitive difficulties but not to make formal diagnoses."
"19937448","Validation studies of the Portuguese experimental version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA): confirmatory factor analysis.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a cognitive screening instrument created with the purpose of overcoming some of the insufficiencies of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The MoCA evaluates more cognitive areas and is comprised of more complex tasks as compared with the MMSE, which makes it a more sensitive instrument in the detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a state that often progresses to dementia. In this study we performed an analysis of the psychometric and diagnostic properties of the Portuguese experimental version of the MoCA in a clinical sample of 212 subjects with MCI and several dementia subtypes in a memory clinic setting. Additionally, we performed a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to assess the MoCA's latent factorial structure. In a clinical population, the MoCA is a valid and reliable instrument with good psychometric properties, revealing high sensitivity in identifying MCI and dementia patients who generally score within the normal range on the MMSE. By using the parcels method, CFA results showed very good/excellent adjustment indexes. The practical implications of this CFA study allow us to propose a two factor model factorial structure for the MoCA: a first factor designated Memory, which includes memory, language and orientation subtests (the latter being closely correlated with the former), and a second factor designated Attention/Executive Functions, comprised of attention, executive functions and visuospacial abilities tasks."
"19831129","Detection of cognitive impairment and dementia using the animal fluency test: the DECIDE study.","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of a one-minute screening test measured against a validated 10-minute screening test for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in detecting CI in patients aged &gt; or = 65 years with two or more vascular risk factors (VRF).METHODS: Patients (n=1523) aged 65 years or older without documented CI symptoms or dementia with two or more VRF participated in this study set in Canadian primary care practice. Baseline data was collected, followed by the 1-minute animal fluency (AF) test and the 10-minute Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Physicians (n=122) completed case reports during patient interviews and reported their diagnostic impression. AF test sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in predicting a positive MoCA was assessed.RESULTS: Study sample mean age was 79.7 years, 55% were female, 97.6% were Caucasian and 75% had &lt; or = 12 years of education. The AF test and MoCA detected CI in 52 and 56 percent of the study population, respectively. The AF test demonstrated sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in predicting a positive MoCA of 67 percent each. Physicians diagnostic impression of MCI was reported for 37% of patients, and of dementia for 6%.CONCLUSION: In an elderly population with at least two VRF, using AF can be useful in detecting previously unknown symptoms of CI or dementia. Screening for CI in this high risk population is warranted to assist physician recognition of early CI. The short AF administration time favours its incorporation into clinical practice."

"19260980","Montreal Cognitive Assessment Arabic version: reliability and validity prevalence of mild cognitive impairment among elderly attending geriatric clubs in Cairo.","AIM: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical label which includes elderly subjects with memory impairment and with no significant daily functional disability. MCI is an important target for Alzheimer's dementia prevention studies. Data on the prevalence and incidence of MCI varies greatly according to cultural difference. The first aim of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Arabic version in MCI detection. The second was to determine the prevalence of MCI among apparently healthy elderly people attending geriatric clubs in Cairo.METHODS: In stage I reliability &amp; validity of MoCA Arabic version were assessed in reference to Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG). In stage II prevalence of MCI was estimated using Arabic MoCA among apparently healthy elderly attending geriatric clubs. These geriatric clubs were randomly selected from different regions in Cairo governorate.RESULTS: Test-retest reliability data of the Arabic MoCA were collected approximately 35.0 +/- 17.6 days apart. The mean change in Arabic MoCA scores from the first to second evaluation was 0.9 +/- 2.5 points, and correlation between the two evaluations was high (correlation coefficient = 0.92, P &lt; 0.001). The internal consistency of the Arabic MoCA was good, yielding a Cronbach's alpha on the standardized items of 0.83. In diagnosing mild cognitive impairment, the Arabic MoCA showed 92.3% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity. The prevalence of MCI among elderly subjects attending geriatric clubs in Cairo is 34.2% and 44.3% of healthy men and women, respectively.CONCLUSION: Older age, female sex and less education are the independent risk factors for MCI among apparently healthy elderly subjects attending geriatric clubs in Cairo."
"19170786","Montreal cognitive assessment performance in patients with Parkinson's disease with &quot;normal&quot; global cognition according to mini-mental state examination score.","OBJECTIVES: To examine Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) performance in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with &quot;normal&quot; global cognition according to Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score.DESIGN: A cross-sectional comparison of the MoCA and the MMSE.SETTING: Two movement disorders centers at the University of Pennsylvania and the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center.PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of 131 patients with idiopathic PD who were screened for cognitive and psychiatric complications.MEASUREMENTS: Subjects were administered the MoCA and MMSE, and only subjects defined as having a normal age- and education-adjusted MMSE score were included in the analyses (N=100). As previously recommended in patients without PD, a MoCA score less than 26 was used to indicate the presence of at least mild cognitive impairment (MCI).RESULTS: Mean MMSE and MoCA scores+/-standard deviation were 28.8+/-1.1 and 24.9+/-3.1, respectively. More than half (52.0%) of subjects with normal MMSE scores had cognitive impairment according to their MoCA score. Impairments were seen in numerous cognitive domains, including memory, visuospatial and executive abilities, attention, and language. Predictors of cognitive impairment on the MoCA using univariate analyses were male sex, older age, lower educational level, and greater disease severity; older age was the only predictor in a multivariate model.CONCLUSION: Approximately half of patients with PD with a normal MMSE score have cognitive impairment based on the recommended MoCA cutoff score. These results suggest that MCI is common in PD and that the MoCA is a more sensitive instrument than the MMSE for its detection."
"21154110","Psychometric evaluation of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in three diverse samples.","Our objective was to evaluate the utility of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in both non-clinical and clinical populations. The MoCA, a tool used widely in clinical geriatric practice to detect and quantify cognitive impairment, was administered to three diverse samples to assess the psychometric properties of the instrument. Participants were 482 healthy persons seen in the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study (CCLS), 1923 healthy volunteers evaluated by the Dallas Heart Study (DHS), a population-based sample of Dallas County residents and 69 persons with known or suspected brain pathology, seen for clinical evaluation. The standard deviations in the CCLS and DHS groups were small (2.81, 3.87) and moderate in the clinical group (5.22). The corresponding raw coefficients alpha were. 50,. 63, and. 75. Thus, variability and internal consistency were associated. MoCA scores generally did not correlate with gender and correlated with age only in the clinical group. However, there were moderately strong positive correlations between MoCA scores and education in all three samples. The reliability of the MoCA was extremely low in the two non-clinical groups, but was high in the clinical group. Although useful in large non-clinical studies, the MoCA is best suited to detect and quantify cognitive impairment in clinical patients."
"20714236","Cognitive impairment predicts functional capacity in dementia-free patients with cardiovascular disease.","BACKGROUND AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVE: A high proportion of elderly people with cardiovascular diseases and risk factors have mild forms of cognitive impairment, the functional impact of which is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine whether subtle cognitive impairment contributes to limitations in instrumental activities of daily living in this group and whether this association is independent of physical comorbidity and other potentially confounding factors.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and nineteen nondemented patients were recruited from cardiovascular and diabetic hospital outpatient clinics. Functional dependence was assessed using the self-report version of the instrumental activities of daily living scale. Cognitive ability was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Demographic and clinical information was collected via interview and a review of hospital records. Standard logistic regression was performed to identify factors independently associated with functional status.RESULTS: Five variables (sex, cardiovascular disease burden, non-cardiovascular disease burden, cognitive status, and age) were independently associated with an increased likelihood of requiring assistance with 1 or more everyday activities. The likelihood of needing assistance increased 2.05 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.59-2.79) for each additional cardiovascular diagnosis present and 1.12 times (95% CI, 1.01-1.27) for every point lower on MoCA. Thus, in comparison to a person with a perfect MoCA score, a person who scored in the cognitively impaired range (&lt;23) was 7.7 (CI, 7.07-8.89) times more likely to report that he/she required assistance with an everyday activity.CONCLUSION: Cognitive impairments appear to reduce the ability to independently carry out routine daily tasks in patients with cardiovascular diseases and risk factors. Cognition should therefore be considered along with physical symptoms when assessing and responding to the support needs of this group."
"20689285","Cognitive deterioration rates in patients with Parkinson's disease from northeastern China.","AIMS: Cognitive impairment (CI) is common in Parkinson's disease (PD), and the cognitive deterioration rate (CDR) is heterogeneous among PD patients. However, very few studies have reported on the association of PD features and risk factors with rapid CDR. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is considered to be a sensitive and reliable approach to detect mild CI. In the present study, we sought to define and compare the cognitive profiles and clinical features of PD patients with slow or rapid CDRs, and then to identify the PD risk factors associated with rapid CDR.METHODS: A cross-sectional study of cognitive rate was performed using the MoCA in a cohort of 73 PD patients and 41 controls matched for age, sex and education level.RESULTS: The rapid CDR group was characterized by older age (58.8 years in slow CDR vs. 64.1 in rapid CDR; p = 0.02), later age at disease onset (52.7 vs. 61.7 years; p &lt; 0.001), a faster deterioration rate of movement symptoms (UPDRS III increment of 12.8 vs. 5.9/year; p &lt; 0.001), a higher rate in multiple-domain CI (38.9 vs. 10.8%), and generally lower MoCA subscores for the Clock Drawing Test, attention, verbal fluency and abstraction. According to the univariate logistic regression model, onset age, movement deterioration rate, multiple domains CI and executive function CI were risk factors for rapid CDR. However, only the movement deterioration rate (p = 0.01) and onset age (p = 0.05) remained independent predictors for rapid CDR according to the multivariate logistic regression model.CONCLUSIONS: The CI deterioration in a subset of PD patients appears to progress more rapidly. Identifying those PD patients may not only help to predict the development of PD dementia, but also facilitate therapeutic intervention at early disease stages."

Furthermore, Fuld object memory test (FOM) was used to assess delayed memory while rapid verbal retrieve (RVR) was used to assess language fluency. Digit span subtest was used to assess attention and building blocks was used to assess visual space function respectively.RESULTS: 100 PD patients were recruited, including 52 men and 48 women, from 43 to 86 years old (65.6 +/- 17.1). MMSE scores was used as the standard for Recognition, PD with cognitive impairment accounted for 16%. According to MOCA scores, with PD cognitive disturbances accounted for 83%. Ability for calculation, short-term memory, visual space function, abstract capability, attention and language fluency dysfunction were main cognitive disturbances of PD. Analysis from single factor logistic regression showed that education, age of onset and gender were closely related to the occurrence of cognitive impairment on PD patients.CONCLUSION: Cognitive impairment was common in PD. Ability of calculation, short-term memory, visual space function, abstract capability, attention and language fluency dysfunction were main cognitive disturbances of PD. Cognitive impairment of PD was more likely to occur with low degree of education, late onset of PD, and being female."
"20437940","Selection bias introduced by neuropsychological assessments.","OBJECTIVE: Two prospective studies in patient with brain tumours were performed comparing the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The first assessed their feasibility and the second compared their diagnostic accuracy against a four-hour neuropsychological assessment (NPA). The introduction of the NPA decreased accrual and retention rates. We were therefore concerned regarding potential selection bias.METHODS: Ninety-two patients were prospectively accrued and subsequently divided into three categories: a) no NPA required b) withdrew consent to NPA c) completed NPA. In order to quantify any potential bias introduced by the NPA, patient demographics and cognitive test scores were compared between the three groups.RESULTS: There were significant differences in age (p &lt; 0.001), education (p = 0.034), dexamethasone use (p = 0.002), MMSE (p = 0.005), and MoCA scores (p &lt; 0.001) across the different study groups. Furthermore, with increasing involvement of the NPA, patients' cognitive scores and educational status increased, while their age, dexamethasone use, and opioid use all decreased. Individuals who completed the NPA had higher MoCA scores than individuals who were not asked to complete the NPA (24.7 vs. 20.5; p &lt; 0.001). In addition, this relationship held when restricting the analyses to individuals with brain metastases (p &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the lengthy NPA chosen introduced a statistically and clinically significant source of selection bias. These results highlight the importance of selecting brief and well tolerated assessments when possible. However, researchers are challenged by weighing the improved selection bias associated with brief assessments at the cost of reduced diagnostic accuracy."
"20101272","Application study of quick cognitive screening test in identifying mild cognitive impairment.","OBJECTIVE: To assess whether quick cognitive screening test (QCST) could quickly identify mild cognitive impairment (MCI).METHODS: QCST and a full set of standardized neuropsychological tests, including mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) were performed. A total number of 121 cases of MCI [41 cases of amnestic MCI-single domain (aMCI-s); 44 of amnestic MCI-multiple domain (aMCI-m); 36 of nonamnestic MCI (naMCI)], 79 cases of mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 186 healthy elderly volunteers were employed in the present study. All the participants (55-85 years old) had an educational level no less than 5 years. QCST subtests included word list recall, naming test, animal fluency test, similarity test, color trail-1min, clock drawing test, finger construction test, and digit span test. The total score of QCST was 90 points, 10 points for each index of subtests.RESULTS: The total scores of QCST in MCI, AD and the control groups were (58.13+/-8.18), (44.53+/-10.54) and (72.92+/-6.85) points, respectively. According to the educational level, the cut off scores of participants with an educational level of 5-8 years, 9-12 years and more than 13 years were 63, 65 and 68 points, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of QCST in detection of MCI were 87.6% (85.7% for aMCI-s, 90.1% for aMCI-m and 89.5% for naMCI) and 84.3%, respectively. The area under the curve was 0.923 (95% CI: 0.892-0.953). Delayed memory, color trail-1min and similarity test could help distinguish between aMCI and naMCI.CONCLUSION: QCST may have a good sensitivity and specificity for MCI detection, which warrants its further clinical application."
"22193353","Montreal cognitive assessment: validation study for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was recently proposed as a cognitive screening test for milder forms of cognitive impairment, having surpassed the well-known limitations of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). This study aims to validate the MoCA for screening Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD) through an analysis of diagnostic accuracy and the proposal of cut-offs. Patients were classified into 2 clinical groups according to standard criteria: MCI (n=90) and AD (n=90). The 2 control groups (C-MCI: n=90; C-AD: n=90) consisted of cognitively healthy community dwellers selected to match patients in sex, age, and education. The MoCA showed consistently superior psychometric properties compared with the MMSE, and higher diagnostic accuracy to discriminate between MCI (area under the curve=0.856; 95% confidence interval, 0.796-0.904) and AD patients (area under the curve=0.980; 95% confidence interval, 0.947-0.995). At an optimal cut-off of below 22 for MCI and below 17 for AD, the MoCA achieved significantly superior values in comparison with MMSE for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and classification accuracy. Furthermore, the MoCA revealed higher sensitivity to cognitive decline in longitudinal monitoring. This study provides robust evidence that the MoCA is a better cognitive tool than the widely used MMSE for the screening and monitoring of MCI and AD in clinical settings."
"22176962","[The evolution of cognition and its influence factors after stroke].","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the evolution of cognitive function and its influence factors, so as to provide evidence for guiding treatment of cognitive impairment after stroke.METHODS: A total of 98 cases of patients with stroke admitted in the First and Second Affiliated Hospital of Medical College of Xi'an Jiaotong University and Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital between April and September 2009 were enrolled and recruited. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive function rating scale (MoCA) were adopted to assess the evolution of cognition at acute phase (within 2 weeks), 6 weeks, and 12 weeks after stroke among patients within 2 weeks after onset, questionnaire score = 56, without aphasia and consciousness disturbance and at least one side of upper extremities muscle force = grade 3.RESULTS: When using MMSE scale as criteria, the incidence of cognitive impairment was 24.5% at acute phase, 12.1% at 6 weeks and 9.9% at 12 weeks after stroke, while the incidence was 86.8%, 68.2%, and 38.0% respectively when using MoCA scale as criteria. The scales of MMSE and MoCA were increased and the incidence of cognitive impairment was decreased within 12 weeks after stroke. Logistic regression analysis indicated that, advanced age (ß = -0.124), hypertension (ß = -3.705), low education level(ß = 0.560) and depression after stroke (ß = 4.613) were related with cognitive impairment after stroke (all P values &lt; 0.05); low education level(ß = 0.710), coronary heart disease (ß = -3.649), elevated total cholesterol (TC) (ß = -3.361) and low density lipid cholesterol (LDL-C) (ß = -5.833), and depression (ß = -3.612) delayed recovery of cognition after stroke.CONCLUSIONS: The cognitive function improves and the incidence of cognitive impairment lowers as the time goes on within 12 weeks after stroke. The factors that may affect the improvement of cognitive function include low educational level, coronary heart disease, elevated TC and LDL-C, and post-stroke depression."
"22156700","MoCA, ACE-R, and MMSE versus the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network Vascular Cognitive Impairment Harmonization Standards Neuropsychological Battery after TIA and stroke.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R) are proposed as short cognitive tests for use after stroke, but there are few published validations against a neuropsychological battery. We studied the relationship between MoCA, ACE-R, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in patients with cerebrovascular disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).METHODS: One hundred consecutive non-institutionalized patients had the MMSE, MoCA, ACE-R, and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network Vascular Cognitive Impairment Harmonization Standards Neuropsychological Battery = 1 year after transient ischemic attack or stroke in a population-based study. MCI was diagnosed using modified Petersen criteria in which subjective cognitive complaint is not required (equivalent to cognitive impairment-no dementia) and subtyped by number and type of cognitive domains affected.RESULTS: Among 91 nondemented subjects completing neuropsychological testing (mean/SD age, 73.4/11.6 years; 44% female; 56% stroke), 39 (42%) had MCI (amnestic multiple domain=10, nonamnestic multiple domain=9, nonamnestic single domain=19, amnestic single domain=1). Sensitivity and specificity for MCI were optimal with MoCA &lt;25 (sensitivity=77%, specificity=83%) and ACE-R &lt;94 (sensitivity=83%, specificity=73%). Both tests detected amnestic MCI better than nonamnestic single-domain impairment. MMSE only achieved sensitivity &gt;70% at a cutoff of &lt;29, mainly due to relative insensitivity to single-domain impairment.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA and ACE-R had good sensitivity and specificity for MCI defined using the Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network Vascular Cognitive Impairment Battery =1 year after transient ischemic attack and stroke, whereas the MMSE showed a ceiling effect. However, optimal cutoffs will depend on use for screening (high sensitivity) or diagnosis (high specificity). Lack of timed measures of processing speed may explain the relative insensitivity of the MoCA and ACE-R to single nonmemory domain impairment."
"22115097","Construct Validity of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a brief instrument developed for the screening of milder forms of cognitive impairment. The present study aims to assess the construct related validity of the MoCA through the establishment of the factorial, convergent, and discriminant related validities, and the reliability of data. In a Portuguese sample of 830 participants, several models were tested using Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Although all tested models showed a good fit, the six-factor model based on the conceptual model proposed by the MoCA's authors showed a significantly better fit. The results allowed us to establish the factorial, convergent, and discriminant validity of this six-dimensional structure. An overall psychometric adequacy of the items, and a good reliability were also found. This study contributes to overcome an important gap in the construct related validity of this instrument. The present findings corroborate the six-dimensional structure of the MoCA and provide good evidence of the construct related validity. The MoCA has proved to be an appropriate measure for cognitive screening taking into account different cognitive domains, which will enable clinicians and researchers to use this test and its six latent dimensions to achieve a better understanding of the individuals' cognitive profile."

Normative data were generated by age and education. Pearson correlations and analysis of variance were used to examine relationship to demographic variables. Frequency of missed items was also reviewed.RESULTS: Total scores were lower than previously published normative data (mean 23.4, SD 4.0), with 66% falling below the suggested cutoff (&lt;26) for impairment. Most frequently missed items included the cube drawing (59%), delayed free recall (56%; &lt;4/5 words), sentence repetition (55%), placement of clock hands (43%), abstraction items (40%), and verbal fluency (38%; &lt;11 words in 1 minute). Normative data stratified by age and education were derived.CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the need for population-based norms for the MoCA and use of caution when applying established cut scores, particularly given the high failure rate on certain items. Demographic factors must be considered when interpreting this measure."
"21507144","Neurocognitive impairment in Chinese patients with obstructive sleep apnoea hypopnoea syndrome.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Sleep-disordered breathing is known to be associated with impairment in cognitive function. The aim of this study was to characterize neurocognitive impairment in a cohort of Chinese patients with varying severities of obstructive sleep apnoea hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS), and to develop a sensitive instrument for routine screening of cognitive impairment.METHODS: Eligible patients (n = 394) were categorized into a primary snoring group, and mild, moderate and severe OSAHS groups, based on assessment of AHI. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) questionnaires were administered to assess cognitive function, and the correlations between questionnaire scores and clinical and polysomnographic parameters were further evaluated by stepwise multivariate regression.RESULTS: MoCA scores decreased progressively across the spectrum from primary snoring to severe OSAHS. Importantly, mild neurocognitive impairment as defined by a MoCA score &lt;26 was more common in the moderate (38.6%) and severe (41.4%) OSAHS groups than in the mild OSAHS (25.0%) and primary snoring (15.2%) groups. In contrast, MMSE scores were largely normal and comparable among all four groups. Evaluation of MoCA subdomains further revealed selective reduction in memory/delayed recall, visuospatial and executive function, and attention span in the severe OSAHS group compared with the other groups. Stepwise multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that MoCA scores correlated significantly with lowest oxygen saturation (L-SaO(2) ) and years of education.CONCLUSIONS: Neurocognitive impairment is common in patients with OSAHS. The MoCA is a brief and sensitive tool for the assessment of cognitive impairment in OSAHS patients, whose performance on the MMSE is in the normal range."
"21474808","Is the Montreal Cognitive Assessment superior to the Mini-Mental State Examination to detect poststroke cognitive impairment? A study with neuropsychological evaluation.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A screening test is required to improve the diagnosis of poststroke cognitive impairment. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a newly designed screening test, has been found to be more sensitive than Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), but its clinical value has not been established by means of a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. This study was designed to assess the value of MoCA and MMSE to detect poststroke cognitive impairment determined by a neuropsychological battery.METHODS: Both screening tests and a neuropsychological battery were administered during the acute phase in 95 patients referred for recent infarct or hemorrhage. Raw MMSE and MoCA scores were used with published cutoffs and new cutoff scores for MMSE and MoCA were also computed after adjustment for age and education.RESULTS: Using raw scores, MoCA was more frequently impaired (P=0.0001) than MMSE. MoCA showed good sensitivity (sensitivity, 0.94) but moderate specificity (specificity, 0.42; positive predictive value, 0.77; negative predictive value, 0.76), whereas an inverse profile was observed for MMSE (sensitivity, 0.66; specificity, 0.97; positive predictive value, 0.98; negative predictive value, 0.58). Adjusted scores with new cutoffs (MMSE(adj) =24, MoCA(adj) =20) provided good sensitivity and very good specificity for both tests (MMSE(adj): sensitivity, 0.7, specificity, 0.97, positive predictive value, 0.98, negative predictive value, 0.61; MoCA(adj): sensitivity, 0.67, specificity, 0.9, positive predictive value, 0.93, negative predictive value, 0.57). On receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, areas under the curve of all scores were &gt;0.88.CONCLUSIONS: The previously reported high sensitivity of MoCA is associated with low specificity. Both screening tests are moderately sensitive to acute poststroke cognitive impairment. This study provides indications for the diagnosis of poststroke cognitive impairment."
"21389719","Clock drawing in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment: recommendations for dementia assessment.","BACKGROUND: Clock drawing is part of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test but may have administration and scoring limitations. We assessed (1) the reliability of the MoCA clock criteria relative to a published error scoring approach, (2) whether command-only administration could distinguish dementia from cognitively intact individuals and (3) the value of adding a clock copy condition to the MoCA.METHODS: Three novice raters and clocks from dementia and control participants were used to assess the 3 aims.RESULTS: MoCA interrater and intrarater reliability were low (i.e. intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.12-0.31) and required repeat training. Clocks drawn to command classified dementia at chance. Inclusion of a copy condition demonstrated expected dementia subgroup patterns.CONCLUSION: Reliable clock scoring with MoCA criteria requires practice. Supplementing a clock copy to the standard MoCA test (takes &lt;1 min) will improve dementia assessment."
"23138174","Comparative analysis of the Alzheimer questionnaire (AQ) with the CDR sum of boxes, MoCA, and MMSE.","The Alzheimer Questionnaire (AQ) has been established as a valid and accurate informant-based screening questionnaire for Alzheimer disease and amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Although the AQ's validity and diagnostic accuracy has been established, its performance in comparison with other instruments has not. Thirty-nine amnestic mild cognitive impairment cases and 34 Alzheimer disease cases were matched on the basis of age, education, and sex to 73 cognitively normal individuals. The sample had a mean age of 82.54±7.77 years and a mean education level of 14.61±2.61 years. The diagnostic accuracy of the CDR Sum of Boxes, Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were compared with the AQ. The AQ correlated strongly with the CDR Sum of Boxes (r=0.79) and demonstrated similar diagnostic accuracy with the MoCA and MMSE. These results suggest that the AQ is comparable with other established informant-based and patient-based measures. "
"23137551","COST: Cognitive State Test, a brief screening battery for Alzheimer disease in illiterate and literate patients.","BACKGROUND: The aim was to develop a brief screening battery, Cognitive State Test (COST), for detecting the presence of dementia in both illiterate and literate patients and to assess its validity and reliability.METHODS: COST is a cognitive screening tool that consists of almost all cognitive domains. It takes 5-7 minutes to administer, and has a maximum score of 30. Data were obtained from 114 healthy volunteers and 74 Alzheimer dementia (AD) patients. Subjects' age divided into two groups: A1: &lt;65 years; and A2: =65 years and their education level divided into three groups: E1: illiterate; E2: 1-5 years; and E3: =6 years. For assessing concurrent validity, total COST score was compared to the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Basic Activities of Daily Living (BADL). Sensitivity and specificity were determined through a discriminant analysis using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Internal consistency was measured using Cronbach's coefficient a.RESULTS: For normal and AD subjects, mean age was 64.9±9.8 years (50 women and 64 men) and 67.2±13.2 years (55 women and 19 men), respectively. Schooling ranged from 0-15 years (mean 5.7±4.2 and 3.3±3.8 years, respectively), and 21 and 37 subjects were illiterate, respectively. The COST significantly and positively correlated with MMSE and MoCA, and significantly and inversely correlated with CDR, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and BADL. In the E1, E2, and E3 education groups, the optimal cut-off points of COST chosen for diagnosis of AD were 23/24 (sensitivity: 81%, specificity: 99%), 24/25 (sensitivity: 75%, specificity: 86%), and 26/27 (sensitivity: 77%, specificity: 84%), respectively. When illiterate and literate subjects were then pooled, the optimal cut-off score of COST was 24/25, which yielded a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 87%. Reliability of the COST was good (0.86).CONCLUSION: The COST is a valid and reliable screening battery for detection of dementia both in the illiterate and the literate Alzheimer patients."
"23079403","Evaluation of a practical visual MRI rating scale of brain white matter hyperintensities for clinicians based on largest lesion size regardless of location.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Age-related white matter hyperintensities have prognostic implications, but no accepted clinical standard exists for their assessment. We propose a simple objective visual rating system by using 3T brain MR imaging.MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR imaging from 559 participants was processed by using an automated method to determine WMH volumes and evaluated with a new visual rating scale based on the single largest WMH lesion diameter regardless of location. The reproducibility of the visual system was assessed. The association of WMH visual scores and automated volumes was then compared with cognitive scores from the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, which was available for 510 participants.RESULTS: Inter-reader reproducibility was good for subsamples with both high (n=52) and low (n=40) prevalence of large automated WMH volumes (agreement of 67% and 87.5%, <U+03BA>=0.71 and 0.76, respectively). Correlation between increased WMH and cognitive deficit measurements was equal for our visual ratings and automated volumes (Spearman <U+03C1>=0.118 and 0.109; P values=0.008 and 0.014, respectively). The visual scale retained a significant association with MoCA score after adjusting for age, sex, and education (standardized ß=-0.087, P=.042).CONCLUSIONS: We propose a simple visual WMH scoring system suitable for use as a baseline evaluation in clinical practice."
"23075757","Normative data for the montreal cognitive assessment in a Japanese community-dwelling older population.","BACKGROUND: Although the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is acknowledged as a promising neuropsychological tool, its normative data for older populations have not been established yet. The purpose of this study was to provide normative data for the MoCA in Japanese community-dwelling older people.METHODS: In a Japanese town, 1,977 participants aged 65 years or older (mean age 73.6 years; male 41.3%) completed MoCA tests. After descriptive and regression analyses, normative data were developed for MoCA scores in the population.RESULTS: The mean MoCA score observed (21.8 points) was lower than that for normal controls (27.4 points) in the original validation study of the MoCA. Additionally, 82.6% of MoCA scores fell below the standard cutoff of 26 points for detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The regression analysis showed that higher age and fewer years of formal education were associated with lower MoCA scores (p &lt; 0.001). Normative data for MoCA scores were presented with respect to age and education.CONCLUSION: This study provided normative data for the MoCA in a Japanese community-dwelling older population. This research also suggests that conventional use of the MoCA as a screening tool for MCI might be problematic in cultures different from that in which the cutoff was developed."
"23057677","Elevated levels of interleukin 6 and C-reactive protein associated with cognitive impairment in heart failure.","There is abundant evidence on inflammatory mechanisms in heart failure (HF) that are used for prognostication of the disease; however, data are lacking regarding the association between elevated cytokines, C-reactive protein (CRP), and cognition in HF. A cross-sectional pilot study of 38 patients with HF, aged 62 years (standard deviation± 9 years), predominantly men (68%) and Caucasian (79%) were screened for cognitive function using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The study aimed to examine cognitive scores on MoCA with cytokines, interleukin 6 [IL-6] and tumor necrosis factor a [TNF-a], and CRP as indicators of early cognitive changes in HF. The result showed no direct correlation between cardiac variables and the MoCA score. The MoCA score, however, was inversely associated with IL-6 (r=-0.53, P=.001) and CRP (r=-0.34, P=.04), with no association to TNF-a. Regression analysis on the MoCA score and log-transformed IL-6 accounted for an additional 11% variation and remained statistically significant (P=.008) after controlling for covariates of education, living arrangements, and loneliness. The large effect size (R(2) =0.87) found in this pilot study provides rationale for a larger exploratory study to examine associations between cognitive function, cytokines, and CRP levels and help design future intervention studies."

"23009126","The Beijing version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment as a brief screening tool for mild cognitive impairment: a community-based study.","BACKGROUND: A cross-sectional validation study was conducted in several urban and rural communities in Beijing, China, to evaluate the effectiveness of the Beijing version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-BJ) as a screening tool to detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among Chinese older adults.METHODS: The MoCA-BJ and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were administered to 1001 Chinese elderly community dwellers recruited from three different regions (i.e., newly developed, old down-town, and rural areas) in Beijing. Twenty-one of these participants were diagnosed by experienced psychiatrists as having dementia, 115 participants were diagnosed as MCI, and 865 participants were considered to be cognitively normal. To analyze the effectiveness of the MoCA-BJ, we examined its psychometric properties, conducted item analyses, evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the scale, and compared the scale with the MMSE. Demographic and regional differences among our subjects were also taken into consideration.RESULTS: Under the recommended cut-off score of 26, the MoCA-BJ demonstrated an excellent sensitivity of 90.4%, and a fair specificity (31.3%). The MoCA-BJ showed optimal sensitivity (68.7%) and specificity (63.9%) when the cut-off score was lowered to 22. Among all the seven cognitive sub-domains, delayed recall was shown to be the best index to differentiate MCI from the normal controls. Regional differences disappeared when the confounding demographic variables (i.e., age and education) were controlled. Item analysis showed that the internal consistency was relatively low in both naming and sentence repetition tasks, and the diagnostic accuracy was similar between the MoCA-BJ and the MMSE.CONCLUSIONS: In general, the MoCA-BJ is an acceptable tool for MCI screening in both urban and rural regions of Beijing. However, presumably due to the linguistic and cultural differences between the original English version and the Chinese version of the scale, and the lower education level of Chinese older adults, the MoCA-BJ is not much better than the MMSE in detecting MCI, at least for this study sample. Further modifications to several test items of the MoCA-BJ are recommended in order to improve the applicability and effectiveness of the MoCA-BJ in MCI screening among the Chinese population."
"22996789","Applicability of the MoCA-S test in populations with little education in Colombia.","OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to report on the use of the Spanish version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-S) as cognitive screening tool in a population aged 65 to 74<U+2009>years in the Andes Mountains of Colombia, assessing the influence of education, and to examine its test-retest reliability.METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of 150 subjects aged 65 to 74<U+2009>years recruited from older community social centers in Manizales, Colombia. The Leganes Cognitive Test (LCT), a cognitive screening test for populations with low education, was used to exclude those who were likely to have dementia. The associations between the MoCA total score and cognitive domains and education were examined in the total sample and in those likely free of dementia. MoCA-S test-retest reliability was estimated by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between two measurements taken 7<U+2009>days apart.RESULTS: Participants had low levels of formal education (mean years of schooling, 4.8). According to the LCT, the proportion of people screening positive for dementia was 16% (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>24). The mean MoCA-S scores were 16.1/30 among illiterate subjects, 18.2/30 among those with incomplete primary school, and 20.3/30 among those with complete primary school (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). Errors were frequent in the cube and clock drawing, attention-serial subtraction, verbal fluency, and abstraction. Test-retest reliability was high, ICC<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.86, 95% CI (0.76-0.93).CONCLUSION: The MoCA-S has high reliability in low-educated older Colombians, but scores were strongly dependent on years of education. Social and cultural factors must be considered when interpreting MoCA-S given the high error rates on items that depend on the ability to read and write and on culture."
"22879115","Montreal cognitive assessment in assessing clinical severity and white matter hyperintensity in Alzheimer's disease with normal control comparison.","PURPOSE: Use Taiwanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in evaluating patients in different stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and correlate with white matter change.METHODS: Ninety-seven normal controls (NC), 52 very-mild AD (clinical dementia rating [CDR] = 0.5), 48 mild AD (CDR = 1) and 38 moderate AD (CDR = 2) patients were enrolled for the MoCA, Mini- Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Cognitive Assessment Screening Instrument (CASI). White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on brain MRI were visually rated and classified as deep or periventricular WMHs.RESULTS: In NC group, education (ß = 0.326) but not age (ß = -0.183, p = 0.069), was significantly related to MoCA score. However, while we added two points to the AD patients with less than 6 years education, the effects of education disappeared as compared with those of 7 years of education. For all educational levels, the cutoff value of MoCA for very-mild AD was 22/23 (sensitivity = 82.7%, specificity = 87.6%). No significant differences were found in the areas under the curves that differentiated NC from the patients with AD for MoCA and MMSE (differences = 0.008, p = 0.490), or for MoCA and CASI (differences = 0.023, p = 0.082). Total WMHs, frontal deep and periventricular WMHs were inversely correlated with the attention and delayed-recall subdomain.CONCLUSION: The MoCA is a good clinical tool for screening very-mild stage AD if the educational effects are carefully considered. The correlation between the executive subdomains with the frontal WMHs also makes it a useful tool for detecting subtle WMHs."

"22797211","Alternate-form reliability of the Montreal cognitive assessment screening test in a clinical setting.","AIMS: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has gained recognition for its validity in detecting cognitive impairment in several clinical populations. For serial assessments, alternate forms are needed to overcome possible practice effects. Our objective was to investigate the reliability of two German MoCA alternate forms for longitudinal assessment applications.METHODS: The original and one of two alternate forms of the MoCA were administered within a 60-min interval of a clinical interview in a counterbalanced order to 100 healthy elderly controls, 30 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 30 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The diagnosis of the majority of patients was supported by in vivo AD pathology biomarkers.RESULTS: There was a strong correlation between the alternate forms and the original MoCA in all groups, but particularly in the clinical samples. Total mean scores did not differ significantly between the MoCA versions, even taking into account the presentation order. As in previous studies, age and education influenced performance in the MoCA. The same pattern of group differences (controls &gt; MCI &gt; AD) was observed for each of the versions.CONCLUSION: All three forms can be reliably and interchangeably used in serial cognitive assessment, confirming the MoCA's applicability in research and clinical longitudinal approaches."
"22759627","Differences in cognitive profile between TIA, stroke and elderly memory research subjects: a comparison of the MMSE and MoCA.","BACKGROUND: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) appears more sensitive to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) than the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE): over 50% of TIA and stroke patients with an MMSE score of =27 ('normal' cognitive function) at =6 months after index event, score &lt;26 on the MoCA, a cutoff which has good sensitivity and specificity for MCI in this population. We hypothesized that sensitivity of the MoCA to MCI might in part be due to detection of different patterns of cognitive domain impairment. We therefore compared performance on the MMSE and MoCA in subjects without major cognitive impairment (MMSE score of =24) with differing clinical characteristics: a TIA and stroke cohort in which frontal/executive deficits were expected to be prevalent and a memory research cohort.METHODS: The MMSE and MoCA were done on consecutive patients with TIA or stroke in a population-based study (Oxford Vascular Study) 6 months or more after the index event and on consecutive subjects enrolled in a memory research cohort (the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing). Patients with moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment (MMSE score of &lt;24), dysphasia or inability to use the dominant arm were excluded.RESULTS: Of 207 stroke patients (mean age ± SD: 72 ± 11.5 years, 54% male), 156 TIA patients (mean age 71 ± 12.1 years, 53% male) and 107 memory research subjects (mean age 76 ± 6.6 years, 46% male), stroke patients had the lowest mean ± SD cognitive scores (MMSE score of 27.7 ± 1.84 and MoCA score of 22.9 ± 3.6), whereas TIA (MMSE score of 28.4 ± 1.7 and MoCA score of 24.9 ± 3.3) and memory subject scores (MMSE score of 28.5 ± 1.7 and MoCA score of 25.5 ± 3.0) were more similar. Rates of MoCA score of &lt;26 in subjects with normal MMSE ( =27) were lowest in memory subjects, intermediate in TIA and highest after stroke (34 vs. 48 vs. 67%, p &lt; 0.001). The cerebrovascular patients scored lower than the memory subjects on all MoCA frontal/executive subtests with differences being most marked in visuoexecutive function, verbal fluency and sustained attention (all p &lt; 0.0001) and in stroke versus TIA (after adjustment for age and education). Stroke patients performed worse than TIA patients only on MMSE orientation in contrast to 6/10 subtests of the MoCA. Results were similar after restricting analyses to those with an MMSE score of =27.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA demonstrated more differences in cognitive profile between TIA, stroke and memory research subjects without major cognitive impairment than the MMSE. The MoCA showed between-group differences even in those with normal MMSE and would thus appear to be a useful brief tool to assess cognition in those with MCI, particularly where the ceiling effect of the MMSE is problematic."
"22698956","Comparison of the Saint Louis University Mental Status Examination, the Mini-Mental State Examination, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in detection of cognitive impairment in Chinese elderly from the geriatric department.","INTRODUCTION: The Saint Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS) examination is a popular screening scale for cognitive impairment in North America but has not been studied in Chinese populations. The aim of this study is to compare consistency of the SLUMS with the Chinese version of Mini-Mental Status Examination (CMMSE) and the Beijing version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-B) in Chinese elderly.METHODS: Two hundred seventy-eight Chinese elderly with chronic diseases and geriatric syndromes from the geriatrics department were screened for cognitive impairment, including dementia and mild cognitive impairment, using SLUMS, CMMSE, and MoCA-B. The modified education level cutoff in the diagnostic criteria of SLUMS (mSLUMS) was explored. Scores of the scales and classifications for cognitive status by them were compared using Spearman and <U+03BA> statistics, respectively.RESULTS: Spearman correlation coefficient between scores of the scales were 0.747 (SLUMS vs CMMSE, P &lt; .001), 0.839 (SLUMS vs MoCA-B, P &lt; .001), and 0.773 (CMMSE vs MoCA-B, P &lt; .001). For detection of dementia, <U+03BA> values were 0.462 (SLUMS vs CMMSE, P &lt; .000) and 0.484 (mSLUMS vs CMMSE, P &lt; .000). For mild cognitive impairment, <U+03BA> values were 0.123 (SLUMS vs CMMSE plus MoCA-B in parallel, P = .089) and 0.148 (mSLUMS vs CMMSE plus MoCA-B in parallel, P = .031). For all cognitive impairment, <U+03BA> values were 0.562 (SLUMS vs MoCA-B, P &lt; .000) and 0.650 (SLUMS vs MoCA-B, P &lt; .000).CONCLUSION: Findings from our study indicate that the scores of SLUMS are fairly consistent with MoCA-B and CMMSE in Chinese elderly. Discrepancies of classifications for cognitive status by SLUMS and the other 2 scales implies that further work is needed to explore optimal cutoffs of SLUMS for screening mild cognitive impairment and dementia in elderly Chinese."
"22698678","Cross-cultural difference and validation of the Chinese version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment in older adults residing in Eastern China: preliminary findings.","To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Chinese Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-C) and assess cross-cultural differences in a community-based cohort residing in the Eastern China. The study included 72 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 84 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 146 cognitively normal controls. Sensitivities and specificities were calculated using the recommended cut-off scores. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to determine optimal sensitivity and specificity. Criterion validity, inter-rater, test-retest reliability and internal consistencies of the MoCA-C were examined, and clinical observations made. The influence of age, education level and gender on MoCA score was examined. Using the recommended cut-off score of 26, the area under the ROC (AUC) for predicting MCI groups using the MoCA-C was 0.930 (95%CI: 0.894; 0.965). The MoCA-C demonstrated 92% sensitivity and 85% specificity in screening for MCI. Cultural differences from the original MoCA affected the test response rate. The MoCA-C appears to have utility as a cognitive screen for early detection of AD and for MCI and warrants further investigation regarding its applicability in primary care settings in elderly Chinese people. It will be necessary to revise the contents of the questionnaire to account for by local characteristics."
"22676901","Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA): validation study for vascular dementia.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a brief instrument developed for the screening of milder forms of cognitive impairment, having surpassed the well-known limitations of the MMSE. The aim of the present study was to validate the MoCA as well as its short version, which was proposed by the NINDS-CSN VCI Harmonization Standards for screening Vascular Dementia (VaD) patients. The results, based on a homogeneous sample of 34 VaD patients, indicate that the MoCA is a psychometrically valid and reliable instrument for cognitive screening in VaD patients, showing excellent discriminant validity. Both the full and short versions of the MoCA had excellent diagnostic accuracy in discriminating VaD patients, exhibiting an area under curve (AUC) higher than the MMSE [AUC(MoCA full version) = .950; 95% IC = .868-.988; AUC(MoCA short version) = .936; 95% IC = .849-.981; AUC(MMSE) = .860; 95% IC = .754-.932]. With a cutoff below 17 on the MoCA full version and 8 on the short version, the results for sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and classification accuracy were superior compared to the MMSE. In conclusion, both versions of the MoCA are valid, reliable, sensitive and accurate screening instruments for VaD patients."

All participants underwent general medical, neurological, and psychiatric examinations. The MoCA, the MMSE, CDR and the short (15-item) version of the Geriatric Depression Scale were also applied.RESULTS: Both MCI and AD groups exhibited impaired performance on MoCA compared to controls. Polish versions of the MMSE and MoCA tests were comparable in discriminating mild dementia from both MCI and control groups. The Polish version of the MoCA test performed marginally better than MMSE in discriminating MCI from controls. We propose to use the MoCA test to screen for MCI using an optimal cut-off score of 24 and to screen for dementia using a cut-off score of 19.CONCLUSIONS: The Polish version of the MoCA seems effective in the detection of deteriorated cognitive performance and appropriate for differentiating impaired from preserved cognitive function in a Polish population."
"22368034","Brief screening for mild cognitive impairment: validation of the Brazilian version of the Montreal cognitive assessment.","BACKGROUND: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a brief cognitive schedule that has been developed for the screening of patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). MCI is recognized as a high-risk state for Alzheimer's disease. The aim of the present study is to examine the reliability and validity of the Brazilian version of the MoCA test (MoCA-BR) in a sample of older individuals with at least 4 years of education.METHODS: The MoCA-BR was administered to 112 older adults who were classified into three diagnostic groups according to their cognitive state (Alzheimer's disease, n = 28; MCI, n = 43; normal controls, n = 41). This procedure was based on clinical and neuropsychological data. The performance in the MoCA-BR was compared with the Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and the Cambridge Cognitive Examination. Diagnostic accuracy was examined with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses.RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha for the MoCA-BR was 0.75. Temporal stability (retesting after 3 months) using intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.75 (p &lt; 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of the MoCA-BR for MCI were 81% and 77%, respectively, with a cut-off score of 25 points. The area under the ROC curve for predicting MCI was 0.82 ± 0.06.CONCLUSIONS: The present results indicate that the MoCA-BR maintains its core diagnostic properties rendering it a valid and reliable tool for the screening of MCI among older individuals with at least 4 years of education."

Socio-demographic characteristic data including gender, age, education level, height, weight waist circumference and blood pressure, past history of coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and unhealthy habit of smoking and drinking, were investigated. The patient levels of fasting plasma glucose, fast insulin glycated, hemoglobin and blood lipids were measured on the next day. All subjects were evaluated with regards to the scores of Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), clinical memory scale (CMS), daily living skills assessment (ADL) and Hamilton depression scale (HAMD).RESULT: (1) MCI was more frequently detected in MS subjects than that in the healthy controls (24.4% vs 1.2%); (2)the scores of general MoCA and several parts of MoCA were lower in the MS subjects (scores of general 26.8 ± 0.5, EF4.40 ± 0.04, NAM2.60 ± 0.06, MEM3.60 ± 0.20, ATT5.60 ± 0.09, LANG2.60 ± 0.08, ABS1.50 ± 0.10, ORT5.40 ± 0.13)than those of the controls (scores of general 27.6 ± 0.4, EF4.50 ± 0.05, NAM2.70 ± 0.08, MEM4.20 ± 0.11, ATT5.70 ± 0.08, LANG2.60 ± 0.09, ABS1.60 ± 0.07, ORT5.40 ± 0.10). No statistically significant differences existed in the scores of general MoCA and several parts except for memory and abstract (P &gt; 0.05). The scores of general CMS and several parts of CMS were lower in the MS subjects (scores of general 72 ± 8, memory function reflected in memory 14 ± 2, associating study 14 ± 3, free image memory 14 ± 4, recognition of meaningless figure 16 ± 3, recollection ability of human figure 14 ± 3) than those in the controls (scores of general 85 ± 7, memory function reflected in memory 16 ± 2,associating study 16 ± 3, free image memory 17 ± 3, recognition of meaningless figure 18 ± 3, recollection ability of human figure 17 ± 3). And the differences had statistical significance (P &lt; 0.05); (3) a high degree of education was a protective factor of MCI (OR = 0.512, P = 0.011) while diabetes, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome were the independent risk factors of MCI (OR(1) = 4.240, P(1) = 0.014; OR(2) = 7.230, P(2) = 0.023; OR(3) = 8.620, P(3) = 0.001).CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome are the independent risk factors of MCI."

"22277128","Montreal Cognitive Assessment: influence of sociodemographic and health variables.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a brief cognitive instrument for screening milder forms of cognitive impairment. The present study aimed to analyze the influence of sociodemographic (age, gender, educational level, marital and employment status, geographic region, geographic localization, and residence area) and health variables (subjective memory complaints of the participant and evaluated by the informant, depressive symptoms, and family history of dementia) on the participants' performance on the MoCA. The investigation was carried out in a Portuguese community-based sample of 650 cognitively healthy adults, who were representative of the distribution observed in the Portuguese population. Educational level and age significantly contributed to the prediction of the MoCA scores, explaining 49% of the variance. Regarding health variables, only the subjective memory complaints of the participant showed a small contribution (9%) to the variance on the MoCA scores. This study contributes a useful approach to understanding MoCA performance, stressing the great impact of education and age on scores."
"22258041","Montreal Cognitive Assessment in cryptogenic epilepsy patients with normal Mini-Mental State Examination scores.","This cross-sectional study examined the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) performance in cryptogenic epileptic patients aged more than 15 years with normal global cognition according to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. We tested our hypothesis that the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment and associated patient correlation factors might be increased (score &lt; 26) according to the MoCA, in spite of a normal MMSE score, and that cognitive impairment might occur in a range of domains of the MoCA. Eighty-five patients participated in this study. The mean MoCA score was 22.44 (± 4.32). In spite of a normal MMSE score, which was an inclusion criterion, cognitive impairment was detected in 60% patients based on the MoCA score. The variable that correlated with a higher risk of cognitive impairment was the number of antiepileptic drugs (polytherapy: OR 2.71; CI 1.03-7.15). The mean scores of visuospatial and executive function, naming ability, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall and orientation among patients with mild cognitive impairment were significantly lower than those of patients with normal cognitive function. These findings suggest that mild cognitive impairment in cryptogenic epileptic patients is common. We suggest using MoCA as a screening test for patients with epilepsy."
"22228824","Montreal cognitive assessment in detecting cognitive impairment in Chinese elderly individuals: a population-based study.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has been proved brief and sensitive to screen for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early dementia in some developed countries or areas. However, little MoCA data are available from mainland China. In this study, the MoCA was applied to 8411 Chinese community dwellers aged 65 or older (6283 = cognitively normal [CN], 1687 = MCI, and 441 = dementia). The MoCA norms were established considering significant influential factors. The optimal cutoff points were 13/14 for illiterate individuals, 19/20 for individuals with 1 to 6 years of education, and 24/25 for individuals with 7 or more years of education. With the optimal cutoffs, the sensitivity of the MoCA was 83.8% for all cognitive impairments, 80.5% for MCI and 96.9% for dementia, and the specificity for identifying CN was 82.5%. These indicate that with optimal cutoffs, the MoCA is valid to screen for cognitive impairment in elderly Chinese living in communities."

Subjects aged 60 and above were recruited using systematic sampling method. Cut-off scores of 22/23 for MoCA-BM and 25/26 for M-MMSE were adopted. Kappa value and Pearson's correlation coefficient were used to ascertain the correlation between MOCA-BM and M-MMSE. Data were analysed using Mann-Whitney and Chi Square tests.RESULTS: The mean age of the 180 subjects enrolled was 65.3 years (SD=5.4). They had a median of 6 years (IqR 25-75=5-11) total formal education. The prevalence of MCI using MoCA-BM and M-MMSE was 55.6% and 32.8% respectively. The odds of developing MCI were 1.153 (95% CI=1.055, 1.261; p&lt;0.05) for every 1 year increase in age, 0.813 (95% CI=0.690, 0.959; p&lt;0.05) with every extra year of education. Increasing age and lower education level were significantly associated with MCI. The MoCA-BM showed good internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha of 0.80. It had moderate correlation with M-MMSE (Pearson correlation coefficient=0.770, p&lt;0.001) and moderate agreement for detecting MCI with Kappa values of 0.497 (p&lt;0.001).CONCLUSION: The prevalence of MCI was higher using MoCA-BM compared to M-MMSE.

"24276096","Effectiveness of Montreal Cognitive Assessment for the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease in Singapore.","INTRODUCTION: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an important clinical entity with significant management implications. However, traditional screening tools lack the sensitivity needed to detect amnestic MCI (MCI-A). Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has yet to be validated for the diagnosis of MCI in a multiracial society such as Singapore. We thus aimed to study the effectiveness of MoCA for the diagnosis of MCI-A in the Singapore population.METHODS: Data on patients with MCI-A and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) was obtained from a prospectively collected clinical database between January 2008 and January 2011. Patients with no cognitive impairment (NCI) were recruited from among the spouses and friends of patients attending the memory clinic.RESULTS: There were a total of 212 participants (103 NCI, 49 MCI-A, 60 mild AD). For the diagnosis of MCI-A, a MoCA score of &lt; 26 for patients with = 10 years of education, and a score of &lt; 27 for patients with &gt; 10 years of education provided a sensitivity of &gt; 94%. For the diagnosis of mild AD, a MoCA score of &lt; 24 for patients with = 10 years of education, and a score of &lt; 25 for patients with &gt; 10 years of education provided a sensitivity of &gt; 85%.CONCLUSION: In the Singapore population, we recommend cutoff scores of 26/27 and 24/25 be used to detect MCI-A and mild AD, respectively, when using MoCA.

The objective of this study was to characterize the clinical phenotype of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) PD carriers of the LRRK2 G2019S mutation. We studied 553 AJ PD patients, including 65 patients who were previously reported, from three sites (two in New York and one in Tel-Aviv). Glucocerebrosidase (GBA) mutation carriers were excluded. Evaluations included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the Non-Motor Symptoms (NMS) questionnaire. Regression models were constructed to test the association between clinical and demographic features and LRRK2 status (outcome) in 488 newly recruited participants. LRRK2 G2019S carriers (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>97) and non-carriers (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>391) were similar in age and age at onset of PD. Carriers had longer disease duration (8.6 years vs. 6.1 years; P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001), were more likely to be women (51.5% vs. 37.9%; P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.015), and more often reported first symptoms in the lower extremities (40.0% vs. 19.2%; P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). In logistic models that were adjusted for age, disease duration, sex, education, and site, carriers were more likely to have lower extremity onset (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001), postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.043), and a persistent levodopa response for &gt;5 years (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.042). Performance on the UPDRS, MoCA, GDS, and NMS did not differ by mutation status. PD in AJ LRRK2 G2019S mutation carriers is similar to idiopathic PD but is characterized by more frequent lower extremity involvement at onset and PIGD without the associated cognitive impairment."

"24081441","Memory, mood, and vitamin D in persons with Parkinson's disease.","BACKGROUND: Research in recent years has suggested a role of vitamin D in the central nervous system. The final converting enzyme and the vitamin D receptor are found throughout the human brain. From animal studies vitamin D appears important in neurodevelopment, up-regulation of neurotrophic factors, stabilization of mitochondrial function, and antioxidation.OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between serum vitamin D and neuropsychiatric function in persons with Parkinson's disease (PD).METHODS: This is an add-on study to a longitudinal study following neuropsychiatric function in persons with PD. Baseline neuropsychiatric performance and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D were examined for 286 participants with PD. Measures of global cognitive function (MMSE, MOCA, Mattis Dementia Scale), verbal memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test), fluency (animals, vegetables, and FAS words), visuospatial function (Benton Line Orientation), executive function (Trails Making Test and Digit-Symbol Substitution), PD severity (Hoehn &amp; Yahr and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) and depression (Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)) were administered. Multivariate linear regression assessed the association between vitamin D concentration and neuropsychiatric function, in the entire cohort as well as the non-demented and demented subsets.RESULTS: Using a multivariate model, higher vitamin D concentrations were associated with better performance on numerous neuropsychiatric tests in the non-demented subset of the cohort. Significant associations were specifically found between vitamin D concentration and verbal fluency and verbal memory (t = 4.31, p &lt; 0.001 and t = 3.04, p = 0.0083). Vitamin D concentrations also correlated with depression scores (t = -3.08, p = 0.0083) in the non-demented subset.CONCLUSIONS: Higher plasma vitamin D is associated with better cognition and better mood in this sample of PD patients without dementia. Determination of causation will require a vitamin D intervention study."

The ReHo was calculated to assess the strength of the local signal synchrony and was compared between the two groups.RESULTS: Compared with the controls, the TIA patients exhibited a decreased ReHo in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), the right inferior prefrontal cortex (iPFC), the right ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) and the right dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (dPCC). In addition, the mean ReHo values in the right dlPFC and the right iPFC were significantly correlated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in TIA patients.CONCLUSIONS: Neural activities in the resting state are changed in TIA patients even without visible ischaemic lesions on conventional MRI. The positive correlation between the ReHo of resting-state fMRI and cognition suggests that ReHo could be a promising tool to observe the neurobiological consequences of TIA.SIGNIFICANCE: The present study revealed abnormal local synchronisation of spontaneous neural activities in patients with TIA."

"23982512","Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are associated with cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetic adults.","Hypovitaminosis D is highly prevalent in type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study is to determine the serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] in type 2 diabetic patients with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and examine the relationship of 25(OH)D and MCI with other clinical factors. One hundred and sixty-five diabetic patients were enrolled in this study. Among whom, 95 patients were considered as MCI [Montreal Cognitive Assessment score (MoCA) &lt; 26] and the other 70 as no MCI (MoCA = 26). Subjects were assessed clinically. Diabetic patients with MCI had a longer duration of DM, fewer years of education, elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), resistant index (RI) of carotid, and lower levels of 25(OH)D {[17.35 (13.02-25.92) vs 28.00 (19.67-34.30)] ng/ml, P &lt; 0.001}. The MoCA score was positively correlated with log10[25(OH)D], education year, and inversely correlated with duration of DM, history of hypertension, intima-media thickness (IMT), FBG, max-RI, and min-RI. Log10[25(OH)D] was positively correlated with MoCA score, and inversely correlated with IMT, in multivariate regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, and education year, 25(OH)D (ß = 0.210, P = 0.003), history of hypertension (ß = -0.191, P = 0.007), IMT (ß = -0.194, P = 0.007), and FBG (ß = -0.157, P = 0.026) independently predicted MoCA score. In conclusion, our results suggest that levels of serum 25(OH)D are inversely associated with the cognitive impairment in diabetic patients. Vitamin D may be a potential protective factor for cognitive impairment in patients with type 2 diabetes."
"23978069","Relationships among serum C-reactive protein, receptor for advanced glycation products, metabolic dysfunction, and cognitive impairments.","BACKGROUND: We examined the clinical value of two serum markers of low-grade inflammation, C-reactive protein (CRP) and receptor of advanced glycation products (RAGE), as prognostic indices for cognitive decline.METHODS: Patients with cognitive impairment (n = 377) and controls (n = 66) were examined by blood biochemistry tests, including ELISAs of serum CRP and RAGE, the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and STEAM 1H-MRS of the left hippocampus and thalamus.RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the cognitive impairment group was older (63.10 ± 9.70 years vs. 55.09 ± 10.77 years, P = 0.000) and had fewer years of formal education (9.01 ± 4.01 vs. 12.94 ± 3.0, P = 0.000). There were no significant differences in the frequencies of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia between groups. Serum CRP and RAGE were higher in the cognitive impairment group (CRP: 2.08 mg/L, range 1.07 - 3.36 mg/L vs. 0.21 mg/L, range 0.18 - 0.42 mg/L; RAGE: 4.01, range 2.49 - 5.71, vs. 2.28, range 1.84 - 3.03; P &lt; 0.05 for both). In patients with cognitive impairment, there were negative correlations between cognitive function (as measured by MMSE and MoCA) and both CRP and RAGE levels (P &lt; 0.05). Patients over 55 years exhibited a positive correlation between CRP and myo-inositol peak area in the left hippocampus (P &lt; 0.05), while there was no relationship between RAGE and any metabolite (P &gt; 0.05). Multiple linear regression revealed that CRP was influenced by hypertension (P = 0.026) and cognitive impairment (P = 0.042).CONCLUSIONS: Chronic low-grade inflammation is present in patients with cognitive impairment. Serum CRP, RAGE, and left hippocampal myo-inositol may provide prognostic information on cognitive decline."
"23968941","Correcting the MoCA for education: effect on sensitivity.","OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to quantify the impact of the suggested education correction on the sensitivity and specificity of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).METHOD: Twenty-five outpatients with dementia and 39 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) underwent a diagnostic evaluation, which included the MoCA. Thirty-seven healthy controls also completed the MoCA and psychiatric, medical, neurological, functional, and cognitive difficulties were ruled out.RESULTS: For the total MoCA score, unadjusted for education, a cut-off score of 26 yielded the best balance between sensitivity and specificity (80% and 89% respectively) in identifying cognitive impairment (people with either dementia or aMCI, versus controls). When applying the education correction, sensitivity decreased from 80% to 69% for a small specificity increase (89% to 92%). The cut-off score yielding the best balance between sensitivity and specificity for the education adjusted MoCA score fell to 25 (61% and 97%, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Adjusting the MoCA total score for education had a detrimental effect on sensitivity with only a slight increase in specificity. Clinically, this loss in sensitivity can lead to an increased number of false negatives, as education level does not always correlate to premorbid intellectual function. Clinical judgment about premorbid status should guide interpretation. However, as this effect may be cohort specific, age and education corrected norms and cut-offs should be developed to help guide MoCA interpretation."
"23952181","The effect of mydriatic solutions on cognitive function.","INTRODUCTION: Anticholinergic and sympathomimetic ophthalmic solutions are used for mydriasis. These solutions have well-documented systemic side effects despite their topical administration. However, no studies have been conducted regarding the effect of mydriatic drops on cognitive function. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect, if any, of mydriatic drops on cognitive function, including memory, concentration, and orientation.METHODS: Participants were randomized into two groups using the technique of permuted block randomization, and randomization was stratified by gender, age, and education. Participants in Group 1 completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test with undilated pupils, while participants in Group 2 completed the MoCA test with dilated pupils. Administration time of the MoCA test was approximately 10 minutes, and each participant could receive a maximum of 30 points, with a score of 26 or greater being considered normal cognitive function. Dilation was achieved in both eyes with a combination of tropicamide 0.5% and phenylephrine 2.5%.RESULTS: There was no statistical difference between the MoCA scores of Group 1 and Group 2 (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.65). In addition, MoCA scores were not statistically different between the glaucoma and non-glaucoma subpopulations within each group. MoCA test scores were shown to correlate with education (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.004), age (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0003), and race (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.03). Patients with confirmed or suspected glaucoma whom eyes dilated required 10.8 minutes to complete the MoCA test, while patients with no confirmed or suspected glaucoma whom eyes dilated required 8.5 minutes to complete the test (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02).DISCUSSION: Age, race, and education were found to be the most important factors affecting cognitive function in this study. There was no significant difference in the MoCA test scores of participants with confirmed or suspected glaucoma and participants without glaucoma. There was also no significant difference in the MoCA scores of dilated participants and non-dilated participants as a whole. However, dilation significantly increased the amount of time required to complete the MoCA test among the glaucoma and suspected-glaucoma population. The results of this study suggest that physicians should spend more time with dilated glaucoma patients while explaining medical conditions and treatment instructions in order to ensure that patients have adequate time to comprehend instructions for glaucoma management."

All three groups took the MoCA and MMSE tests at the same time. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests and receiver operating characteristics curve analysis were used to compare the different neuropsychological test results among the groups.RESULTS: The cut-off point of the MoCA for AD was 21/22 with a sensitivity of 95.5% and a specificity of 82.3% (area under the curve (AUC): 0.945), and the cut-off point for DLB was 22/23 with a sensitivity of 91.7% and a specificity of 80.6% (AUC: 0.932). For the MMSE, the cut-off points for AD and for DLB from NC were all 24/25, with a sensitivity of 88.1% and a specificity of 85.5% for AD (AUC: 0.92), and a sensitivity of 77.8% and a specificity of 85.5% for DLB (AUC: 0.895). After controlling sex, age, and education, AD and DLB had lower scores in all MoCA subscales than the NC group (p &lt; 0.05), except for the orientation and naming in DLB. In addition, AD had a lower score in the MoCA orientation (p = 0.03) and short-term memory (p = 0.02) than did DLB.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA is a more sensitive instrument than the MMSE to screen AD or DLB patients from non-dementia cases."
"23900081","Vascular cognitive impairment: most useful subtests of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in minor stroke and transient ischemic attack.","AIMS: Cognitive impairment is frequent in cerebrovascular disease but often remains undetected. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has been proposed in this context. Our aim was to evaluate the MoCA and its subtests in cerebrovascular disease.METHODS: We assessed 386 consecutive patients with minor stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Score &lt;4) or transient ischemic attack at 3 months. The MoCA and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were administered. Computed tomography (CT) scans were assessed for stroke and white matter changes. An unfavorable functional outcome was defined as mRS &gt;1.RESULTS: The prevalence of cognitive impairment (cutoff of 26) was 55% using the MoCA and 13% using the MMSE. In a multivariate analysis, MoCA &lt;26 was associated with the outcome (OR 3.00, CI 1.78-5.03), as were remote lacunar stroke on CT and white matter changes of at least moderate severity. Five subtests (5-word recall, word list generation, trail-making, abstract reasoning and cube copy) formed an optimal short MoCA with 6/10 or less showing a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 83%.CONCLUSION: This study extends the utility of the MoCA to milder forms of cerebrovascular disease. The MoCA is associated with the 3-month functional outcome. Five subtests may constitute an optimal brief tool in vascular cognitive impairment."
"23891119","The effects of educational background on Montreal Cognitive Assessment screening for vascular cognitive impairment, no dementia, caused by ischemic stroke.","It is possible that a patient's educational background has an effect on their Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score, which is used to evaluate patients for vascular cognitive impairment, no dementia (VCIND) after ischemic stroke. Cognitive impairment was evaluated in patients with no cognitive impairment (NCI) or VCIND using the MoCA. The receiver operating characteristic curve and maximal Youden index were used to determine the optimal cut-off values to distinguish between NCI and VCIND. The sensitivity and specificity of MoCA were calculated for patients with primary, secondary and tertiary educational levels. Patients with NCI (n=111) and VCIND (n=95) were tested. In patients with a primary education, a significant difference was found between the two groups in each of the MoCA factors, except for naming. Likewise, a significant difference was found in all factors, except for naming, attention and calculation, for patients with a secondary education. For the patients with a tertiary education, a significant difference was found only in visuospatial/executive abilities, abstraction and memory (p&lt;0.05). The optimal cut-off value for MoCA in order to identify VCIND was 22-23. MoCA showed an overall sensitivity of 65.26% and specificity of 78.73%. The sensitivity in the primary, secondary and tertiary educated groups was 97.06%, 56.10% and 40%, respectively, with the specificity being 47.22%, 87.80% and 100%, respectively. We suggest that the MoCA score needs to be amended according to the patient's educational levels in order to improve the effectiveness of the screening."
"23884868","[Mnemonic complaints and chronic migraine].","INTRODUCTION. Patients with chronic migraine often report lower cognitive performance, which affects their quality of life. AIMS. To analyse whether the mnemonic capacity of patients with chronic migraine is altered or not. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. A cross-sectional study was conducted in patients with chronic migraine evaluated consecutively in our unit, and paired by age (18-60 years) and gender with a control group consisting of cognitively healthy volunteers. The following cognitive instruments were administered: Folstein Minimental State Examination (MMSE), Memory Alteration Test (M@T), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and working memory. RESULTS. A total of 30 patients with chronic migraine were included (mean age: 49.33 ± 10.05 years) paired with a control group of 30 healthy volunteers (mean age: 44.83 ± 10.91 years). The mean elapsed time since onset of the patients with chronic migraine was 4.47 ± 2.74 years. On performing a comparative analysis between the two groups, significant differences were found with overall lower scores in the group of patients with chronic migraine in the MoCA (24.16 versus 29), M@T (43.76 versus 48.8) and working memory tests (17.5 versus 24.26). Performance in the MMSE was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS. Patients with chronic migraine can have lower cognitive performance regardless of distracting elements, such as pharmacological factors or psychiatric comorbidity, since chronic migraine can be understood as yet another element within the spectrum of chronic pain.

Analizar si existe alteracion en la capacidad mnesica de los pacientes con migraña cronica. Sujetos y metodos. Estudio transversal en pacientes con migraña cronica valorados de forma consecutiva en nuestra unidad, pareados en edad (18-60 años) y sexo con un grupo control constituido por voluntarios cognitivamente sanos. Se administraron los siguientes instrumentos cognitivos: test minimental de Folstein (MMSE), test de alteracion de memoria (T@M), evaluacion cognitiva de Montreal (MoCA) y memoria de trabajo. Resultados. Se incluyo un total de 30 pacientes con migraña cronica (edad media: 49,33 ± 10,05 años) pareados con un grupo control de 30 voluntarios sanos (edad media: 44,83 ± 10,91 años). El tiempo medio de evolucion de los pacientes con migraña cronica fue de 4,47 ± 2,74 años. Al realizar el analisis comparativo entre ambos grupos, se encontraron diferencias significativas con puntuaciones mas bajas de forma global en el grupo de pacientes con migraña cronica en el test de MoCA (24,16 frente a 29), T@M (43,76 frente a 48,8) y memoria de trabajo (17,5 frente a 24,26). El rendimiento en el MMSE fue similar en ambos grupos. Conclusiones. Los pacientes con migraña cronica pueden tener un menor rendimiento cognitivo independientemente de elementos distractores, como el farmacologico o la comorbilidad psiquiatrica, dado que la migraña cronica puede entenderse como un elemento mas dentro del espectro del dolor cronico."
"23816457","Cognitive impairment and antiphospholipid syndrome: is paradoxical embolism the rule?","OBJECTIVE: Although cognitive decline (CD) is described in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), its physiopathology is unknown. Paradoxical embolization (PE) is related to CD in Alzheimer disease. The objective of this study was to determine whether PE plays a role in CD in APS patients through a significant right-to-left shunt (sRLS).METHODS: A total of 27 patients diagnosed with APS without a history of stroke were tested for the presence of an sRLS using a contrast-enhanced transcranial Doppler (cTCD) ultrasound. Cognitive decline was assessed using the mini mental state examination (MMSE), the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), and a battery of neuropsychological tests.RESULTS: Of the 27 patients, 19 (70%) had a non-sRLS condition (= 10 high-intensity transient signs [HITS] on cTCD), and 8 (30%) had an sRLS. Patients with more than 10 years of scholarship performed significantly better on both the MMSE (P = 0.048) and MoCA (P = 0.03). Individuals of the non-sRLS group with more than 10 years of scholarship had better performances on the five-point test (FPT) when compared with the sRLS group (P = 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Patients without sRLS and with more years of education exhibited a better performance in cognitive tests than sRLS patients."
"23716072","Predictive value of MoCA in the acute phase of stroke on the diagnosis of mid-term cognitive impairment.","Post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) includes all forms of cognitive decline that develop after stroke, even if not severe enough to fit the criteria of dementia. Our aims were to investigate the predictive value of a brief bedside examination (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA) in the acute phase of stroke on the diagnosis of mid-term PSCI, taking into account other clinical, cognitive, functional, and neuroimaging predictors. Consecutive patients admitted to a stroke unit were evaluated with MoCA between 5 and 9 days after stroke. At baseline, clinical, functional, and neuroimaging data were collected. Patients were reassessed between 6 and 9 months after stroke by means of an extensive neuropsychological and functional evaluation. Out of 137 enrolled stroke patients, 80 (58.4%) were followed up (mean age 68.2 ± 14.6 years, males 66%, mean NIHSS score 3.6 ± 4.8). PSCI was diagnosed in 47 patients (59%; 35 mild cognitive impairment, 12 dementia). Controlling for age, education, functional and cognitive pre-morbid status, stroke severity, and pre-existing lacunar infarcts, MoCA baseline score [OR (95% CI) = 1.4(1.1-1.8)] for each point] and leukoaraiosis severity [OR (95% CI) = 0.4(0.2-0.9)] for each point of the van Swieten scale] were independently associated with PSCI. Using a ROC analysis, a cut-off of 21 predicted the diagnosis of PSCI with 91.4 % sensitivity, 75.8 % specificity, 80 % positive predictive value, and 89.3 % negative predictive value. In a sample of mild stroke patients, MoCA seems to be a good predictor of mid-term PSCI, making it a possible candidate for a brief cognitive screening in the acute stroke setting."

Those with severe cognitive impairment, dementia, or Parkinson's disease were excluded.MEASUREMENTS: Measurements included height and weight, normal walking speed, Timed Up-and-Go, handgrip strength, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Color Trails Test, and bone mineral density. Normative values were estimated using generalized additive models for location shape and scale (GAMLSS) and are presented as percentiles, means, and standard deviations.RESULTS: Generalized additive models for location shape and scale fit the observed data well for each measure, leading to reliable estimates of normative values. Performance on all tasks decreased with age. Educational attainment was a strong determinant of performance on all cognitive tests. Tests of walking speed were dependent on height. Distribution of body mass index did not change with age, owing to simultaneous declines in weight and height.CONCLUSION: Normative values were found for tests of many aspects of cognitive and physical function based on a representative sample of the general older Irish population."
"23637698","Reliability, validity, and optimal cutoff score of the montreal cognitive assessment (changsha version) in ischemic cerebrovascular disease patients of hunan province, china.","AIMS: The goal of this study was to examine the reliability and validity of the Changsha version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-CS) in ischemic cerebrovascular disease patients of Hunan Province, China, and to explore the optimal cutoff score for detecting vascular cognitive impairment-no dementia (VCI-ND) and vascular dementia (VD).METHODS: Three hundred and thirty-eight ischemic cerebrovascular disease patients (131 with normal cognition, 111 with VCI-ND, and 96 with VD) and 132 healthy controls were recruited. All participants accepted examination by the MoCA-CS, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and other related scales. A detailed neuropsychological battery was used for making a final cognitive diagnosis. SPSS 16.0 statistical software was used for reliability, validity examination, and optimal cutoff score detection.RESULTS: Cronbach's a of the MoCA-CS was 0.884, and test-retest and interrater reliability of the MoCA-CS were 0.966 and 0.926, respectively. MoCA-CS scores were highly correlated with MMSE scores (r = 0.867) and simplified intelligence quotients (r = 0.822). The results indicate that 1 point should be added for subjects with less than 6 years of education, and that the optimal cutoff score for detecting VCI-ND is 26/27 (sensitivity 96.1%, specificity 75.6%), whereas the optimal cutoff score for detecting VD is 16/17 (sensitivity 92.7%, specificity 96.3%).CONCLUSION: The MoCA-CS has good reliability and validity, and is a useful cognitive screening instrument for detecting VCI in the Chinese population."
"23584853","Premorbid IQ influence on screening tests' scores in healthy patients and patients with cognitive impairment.","Cognitive screening tests are well-established tools for detecting cognitive impairment, but concerns regarding the influence of premorbid intelligence on patient's performance and cognitive status classification remain. Risk of inaccurate assessment especially affects the elders with high or low premorbid intelligence (who are more likely to be misclassified). The present study examines the influence of premorbid intelligence assessed by the TeLPI (an irregular words reading test) on 2 cognitive screening tests, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), in healthy participants and patients with cognitive impairments (mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease). Results show that premorbid IQ influences the MMSE and the MoCA scores in both the groups, predicting variance from 8.4% to 33.2%, according to test and group analyzed. Hence, we propose that whenever the MMSE or the MoCA is used, premorbid IQ evaluation should also be considered to ensure correct interpretation and classification."
"23577654","Assessment of cognitive function in adult patients with hemorrhagic moyamoya disease who received no surgical revascularization.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Due to controversial surgical treatment for hemorrhagic moyamoya disease (MMD), a large proportion of these patients chose conservative treatment. The aim of this study was to assess cognitive function in adult patients with hemorrhagic MMD who received no surgical revascularization.METHODS: Twenty-six adult hemorrhagic MMD patients with only intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) confirmed by positive computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scan, 20 patients with spontaneous IVH whose digital subtraction angiography results were negative, and 30 healthy controls were identified and matched for age, gender, education background and living area. Cognitive function was evaluated by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The non-parametric test was used for comparisons among the three groups.RESULTS: No patient was confirmed cognitive dysfunction at the initial screening. Twenty-four (92%) cases presented mild cognitive impairment (MCI) after 1 year. All the cases demonstrated MCI after 2 years. The difference between cases and healthy controls was statistically significant at the second screening (P = 0.000) and the third screening (P = 0.000), as was that between cases and patients with spontaneous IVH at the second screening (P = 0.000) and the third screening (P = 0.000). In addition, there were significant decreases in all MoCA subscores (P = 0.000) with special regards to delayed recall, visual space and executive function in cases compared with the other two groups. Moreover, significant differences were found in the subgroups of smoking (P = 0.021) and Suzuki angiographic classification of MMD (P = 0.030).CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairment is a long-term complication for adult hemorrhagic MMD patients who underwent conservative treatment."
"23548916","The NeuroAiD II (MLC901) in vascular cognitive impairment study (NEURITES).","BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of patients after nondisabling stroke are cognitively impaired compared to age- and education-matched community-dwelling controls. Moreover, poststroke patients who have 'vascular cognitive impairment no dementia' (VCIND) of moderate severity have a high risk of incident dementia, dependency and death. Further studies are urgently needed to demonstrate effective cognition-enhancing therapies in VCIND given the scarcity of evidence-based treatment options. NeuroAiD is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been shown to induce neuroplasticity, promote cell proliferation and stimulate the development of dense axonal and dendritic networks in animal stroke models. NeuroAiD may improve cerebral blood flow and functional recovery after stroke in patients.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects and tolerability of NeuroAiD II in patients with VCIND.METHODS: The NeuroAiD II (MLC901) in Vascular Cognitive Impairment Study (NEURITES) is a 24-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase II study of NeuroAiD II in patients with VCIND. The primary outcome is executive function as measured by the Verbal Fluency test. Secondary outcomes include cognitive assessments such as the ADAS-Cog, MoCA, MMSE and Cognitive Battery: activities of daily living as measured by the Alzhei-mer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scale for mild cognitive impairment, behavior as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and depression as measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale and the Beck Depression Scale. In addition, there will be novel exploratory outcomes: (a) magnetic resonance imaging of lesion location (structural imaging), structural integrity of white matter pathways (diffusion tensor imaging), neuronal function (resting studies) and perfusion (arterial spin labeling and MR angiography), and (b) retinal and optic nerve imaging. Safety and tolerability will be assessed using adverse events, laboratory tests and vital signs.CONCLUSIONS: NEURITES has the potential to set new standards for the systematic evaluation of Asian traditional medicine for integration into standard medicine practice and establishing a novel therapeutic approach for improving cognition after stroke."
"23569023","Relationship between cerebral microbleeds and cognitive function in lacunar infarct.","OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the impact of cerebral microbleeds on cognitive function. This study investigated the distribution of cerebral microbleeds and their impact on cognitive function, in patients with lacunar infarct.METHODS: Patients with lacunar infarct were enrolled prospectively. Cerebral microbleeds were classified as absent, mild, moderate or severe, based on magnetic resonance imaging findings. Cognitive function was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) questionnaire, with a total score of &lt;26 indicating cognitive impairment.RESULTS: Of the 85 patients included in the study, 35 (41.2%) had cerebral microbleeds. They were more frequently observed in mixed and deep brain regions, but rarely in the cerebral lobes. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that presence of cerebral microbleeds (odds ratio [OR] 5.320), duration of education (OR 0.938) and age (OR 1.464) were independent predictors of cognitive impairment. There was a significant correlation between cerebral microbleed severity and MoCA score.CONCLUSION: The number and location of cerebral microbleeds were both closely associated with cognitive impairment, in patients with lacunar infarct."
"23425001","Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Mini-Mental State Examination are both valid cognitive tools in stroke.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the validity of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) as screening tools for cognitive impairment after stroke.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cognitive assessments were administered over 2 sessions (1 week apart) at 3 months post-stroke. Scores on the MoCA and MMSE were evaluated against a diagnosis of cognitive impairment derived from a comprehensive neuropsychological battery (the criterion standard).RESULTS: Sixty patients participated in the study [mean age 72.1 years (SD = 13.9), mean education 10.5 years (SD = 3.9), median acute NIHSS score 5 (IQR 3-7)]. The MoCA yielded lower scores (median = 21, IQR = 17-24; mean = 20.0, SD = 5.4) than the MMSE (median = 26, IQR = 22-27; mean = 24.2, SD = 4.5). MMSE data were more skewed towards ceiling than MoCA data (skewness = -1.09 vs -0.73). Area under the receiver operator curve was higher for MoCA than for MMSE (0.87 vs 0.84), although this difference was not significant (<U+03C7>(2) = 0.48, P = 0.49). At their optimal cut-offs, the MoCA had better sensitivity than the MMSE (0.92 vs 0.82) but poorer specificity (0.67 vs 0.76).CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA is a valid screening tool for post-stroke cognitive impairment; it is more sensitive but less specific than the MMSE. Contrary to the prevailing view, the MMSE also exhibited acceptable validity in this setting."
"23406880","Proxies of cognitive reserve and their effects on neuropsychological performance in patients with mild cognitive impairment.","Cognitive reserve (CR) modulates the relationship between clinical and pathological phenotypes by restricting the negative effect of cerebral lesions on cognition, according to the CR hypothesis. In this study, we evaluated 18 healthy subjects and 21 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using conventional MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The MMSE, WMS and MoCA assessments were repeated 1year later. The MRS analysis results showed that the N-acetyl-aspartate peak area (NAA; t=5.122, P&lt;0.001) and the NAA/creatine (Cr), NAA/myo-inositol (mI) and NAA/choline (Cho) ratios were significantly changed in patients with MCI compared with the control subjects (all P&lt;0.01). The MoCA was significantly related to the NAA/Cho ratio (R=0.443), the NAA/Cr ratio (R=0.533), and the NAA peak area (R=0.814; all P&lt;0.05), but was unrelated to the NAA/mI ratio (R=0.400, P=0.072). We found that the hippocampal volume was significantly correlated with the MoCA, WMS and MMSE (R=0.704, 0.677, 0.542 respectively; all P&lt;0.05). Education level had a positive effect on changes in the MoCA, MMSE, and WMS 1year later. We believe that MoCA and WMS results, MRI hippocampal volume and other related indicators (NAA peak area, NAA/Cr ratio, NAA/mI ratio, and NAA/Cho ratio) may reflect the degree of CR capacity, and that the number of years of education can significantly affect the changes in cognitive function in patients with MCI. Therefore, increasing levels of education and life skills training can help increase CR, reduce the risk of MCI, and slow down the appearance of clinical manifestations and clinical progress in patients with MCI."

The surveys queried demographics, attitudes about the value of Board certification, and attitudes and knowledge about Maintenance of Certification in Anesthesiology (MOCA).MAIN RESULTS: 17% to 27% of diplomates from each group completed the survey. The majority of these diplomates perceived Board certification to be of value in demonstrating competence, although fewer believed that Board certification reflected competence. The elements of Professional Standing and Lifelong Learning and Self-Assessment were perceived to be significantly more relevant to the practice of the diplomates than were the Cognitive Examination and Practice Performance Assessment and Improvement activities. Diplomates demonstrated concerns about the cost and complexity of MOC, a lack of evidence that it improves practice, and a belief that the Cognitive Examination covered topics that were not relevant to their current practice.CONCLUSIONS: Although diplomates of the ABA highly value Board certification and report that the components of the MOCA program have potential relevance to their practices, they expressed significant concerns about the program as it is currently implemented."
"23380993","The informant AD8 is superior to participant AD8 in detecting cognitive impairment in a memory clinic setting.","The informant AD8 has good discriminatory indices in detecting questionable dementia. However, studies on participant AD8 yielded inconsistent results. This study aims to investigate the discriminatory ability of the AD8 in detecting cognitive impairment at a memory clinic by comparing the informant AD8, participant AD8, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The AD8 was administered to 280 participant-informant dyads. The MoCA and MMSE were administered to all participants, who subsequently received a comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological assessment leading to a consensus diagnosis and a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to compare the discriminatory ability of AD8, MoCA, and MMSE. Participants were Chinese (83.6%) females (54.3%) with a mean age and education of 73.4 ± 8.6 years and 6.2 ± 5.6 years, respectively. The discriminant validity of the informant AD8 was significantly superior to the participant AD8 in detecting cognitive impairment (CDR = 0.5) {Area Under Curve (AUC) [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 0.96 (0.93-0.98) versus 0.66 (0.58-0.74), p &lt; 0.01}. Furthermore, the informant AD8 was equivalent to MoCA and MMSE in detecting cognitive impairment {AUC [95% CI]: MoCA [0.98 (0.96-0.99)]; MMSE [0.95 (0.93-0.98)]}. The informant AD8 (=2) had very good sensitivity and specificity, while the participant AD8 (=2) had suboptimal sensitivity and specificity in detecting cognitive impairment (sensitivity 0.93 versus 0.59; specificity 0.87 versus 0.65; 91.8% versus 60% correctly classified).

"23292208","Factors predicting the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) applicability and performances in a stroke unit.","The evaluation of cognitive status is not routine in the acute stroke setting. We aimed to investigate feasibility, applicability, and performances of the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) in acute stroke patients. Consecutive stroke patients (ischemic or hemorrhagic) admitted to one stroke unit were evaluated 5-9 days after stroke with MoCA (score range: 0-30; higher scores indicate better cognitive performance). Pre-morbid functional and cognitive status was assessed by a structured interview to caregivers. Neuroimaging data regarding index stroke and pre-existing lesions were collected. From December 2009 to December 2010, out of 207 patients with stroke, 137 (66%) were enrolled [mean age 69.2 ± 14.8 years; males 62%; mean National Institute of Health and Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score 5.9 ± 7.9]. The most common reason for non-enrolment was unfitting the time window inclusion criteria. MoCA was entirely applicable to 113/137 (82.5%) patients and the mean score was 17.8 ± 7.1. Multivariate analyses showed that non-applicability was associated with higher NIHSS scores [OR (95% CI) = 1.4 (1.2-1.7) for each point], left sided lesions [OR (95% CI) = 18.8 (2.3-155.2)], and worse pre-morbid functional status [OR (95% CI) = 0.7 (0.6-0.9) for each point of the instrumental activity of daily living scale]. Factors influencing MoCA performance were low education (ß = 0.264, p &lt; 0.01), higher NIHSS scores (ß = -0.277, p &lt; 0.01) and worse pre-morbid functional status (ß = 0.504, p &lt; 0.001). MoCA administration is feasible in acute patients with mild-to-moderate stroke, with lesion location, stroke severity, and pre-morbid functional status as major determinants of its applicability and performance. MoCA seems to reveal some degree of cognitive deficit even in patients with mild stroke."
"23290422","Cognitive impairments in patients with cerebrovascular risk factors: a comparison of Mini Mental Status Exam and Montreal Cognitive Assessment.","OBJECTIVE AND BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that cerebrovascular risk factors are contributing factors, not only to vascular cognitive decline, but also for Alzheimer's disease. The study aim was to compare Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and MMSE tests in subjects with cerebrovascular risk factors.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty patients with cerebrovascular risk factors were administrated the MMSE and MoCA tests. Data collected for all subjects and the results were compared.RESULTS: Cognitive impairments revealed on both tests were more frequent in females, and correlated with the level of education (for MoCA r=0.75, p=0.001 and for MMSE r=0.662, p=0.001). Mean values of MoCA score were significantly lower in patients with two or more cerebrovascular risk factors compared with those with only one risk factor (19.92±5.99 versus 23.81±4.06; p=0.049), a finding that was not evidenced by MMSE.CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent impaired domain in MMSE (for scores both less and more than 26) was attention; but in MoCA the most frequent impaired domains were delayed recall (for scores above 26), and visuo-executive (for scores=26), which is a common domain involved in vascular cognitive decline. MoCA may be superior to MMSE in early detection of cognitive decline in patients with vascular risk factors."
"25537414","[Assessment of cognition and associated factors in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].","OBJECTIVE: To explore and analyze the cognitive function in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).METHODS: The cognition differences between patients with COPD and healthy subjects were analyzed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). GOLD grade, PaO2, PaCO2, the education degree and the age were included as associated factors. The correlation between those factors with cognition were analyzed.RESULTS: The MoCA in patients with COPD was 20.6 ± 2.3, and that in healthy subjects was 25.3 ± 1.7; the difference between the 2 groups being significant (P &lt; 0.01). The MoCA was 22.4 ± 0.8 in patients with GOLD grade I disease, 21.7 ± 1.0 in grade II, 20.2 ± 1.2 in grade III, and 19.1 ± 1.20 in grade IV diseases; the difference among the 4 subgroups being significant (F = 31.69, P &lt; 0.05). The MoCA in GOLD grade I was higher than that in GOLD grade II, but the difference did not reach significance (P &gt; 0.05). The MoCA of GOLD grade II was higher than that in GOLD grade III (P &lt; 0.05) , and the MoCA of GOLD grade III was higher than that GOLD grade IV (P &lt; 0.05). The MoCA in non-hypoxemia subgroup and hypoxemia subgroup was 22.2 ± 1.1 and 19.8 ± 1.1, respectively (P &lt; 0.05) , while the MoCA in hypercapnia subgroup and non-hypercapnia subgroup was 20.0 ± 1.3 and 22.3 ± 1.0 respectively (P &lt; 0.05). By regression analysis, the score of MoCA was correlated positively to education degree (Standard B1 = 0.134, P &lt; 0.01), GOLD grade(Standard B2 = 0.351, P &lt; 0.01) and PaO2(Standard B3 = 0.305, P &lt; 0.01), while the score of MoCA was correlated negatively to age(Standard B4 = -0.146, P &lt; 0.01) and PaCO2(Standard B5 = -0.145, P &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA score in patients with COPD was lower than that in healthy people. Lower MoCA score was found in patients with severe COPD. The MoCA scores in both hypoxemia subgroup and hypercapnia subgroup were lower. The cognitive dysfunction in patients with stable COPD was positively correlated with education degree, GOLD grade, and PaO2, but negatively with age and PaCO2."
"25523313","Posterior brain white matter abnormalities in older adults with probable mild cognitive impairment.","OBJECTIVE: Much of the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) neuroimaging literature has exclusively focused on regions associated with Alzheimer's disease. Little research has examined white matter abnormalities of other brain regions, including those associated with visual processing, despite evidence that other brain abnormalities appear in these regions in early disease stages.METHOD: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was utilized to examine participants (n = 44) that completed baseline imaging as part of a longitudinal healthy aging study. Participants were divided into two groups based on scores from the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a brief screening tool for MCI. Participants who scored &lt;26 were defined as &quot;probable MCI&quot; while those who scored =26 were labeled cognitively healthy. Two DTI indices were analyzed including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). DTI values for white matter in the lingual gyrus, cuneus, pericalcarine, fusiform gyrus, and all four lobes were compared using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Regression analyses examined the relationship between DTI indices and total MoCA score.RESULTS: RESULTS revealed significantly lower FA in the probable MCI group in the cuneus, fusiform, pericalcarine, and occipital lobe, and significantly higher MD in the temporal lobe. Fusiform FA and temporal lobe MD were significantly related to total MoCA score after accounting for age and education.CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS indicate that there are posterior white matter microstructural changes in individuals with probable MCI. These differences demonstrate that white matter abnormalities are evident among individuals with probable MCI in regions beyond those commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease and anterior brain aging patterns."
"25481217","A mobile application for cognitive screening of dementia.","Neuropsychological assessment tests have an important role in early detection of dementia. Therefore, we designed and implemented a test battery for mobile devices that can be used for mobile cognitive screening (MCS). This battery consists of 33 questions from 14 type of tests for the assessment of 8 different cognitive functions: Arithmetic, orientation, abstraction, attention, memory, language, visual, and executive functions. This test battery is implemented as an application for mobile devices that operates on Android OS. In order to validate the effectiveness of the neuropsychological test battery, it was applied on a group of 23 elderly persons. Within this group, 9 (of age 81.78±4.77) were healthy and 14 (of age 72.55±9.95) were already diagnosed with dementia. The education level of the control group (healthy) and dementia group were comparable as they spent 13.66±5.07 and 13.71±4.14 years at school respectively. For comparison, a validated paper-and-pencil test (Montreal Cognitive Test - MoCA) was applied along with the proposed MCS battery. The proposed test was able to differentiate the individuals in the control and dementia groups for executive, visual, memory, attention, orientation functions with statistical significance (p&lt;0.05). Results of the remaining functions; language, abstraction, and arithmetic were statistically insignificant (p&gt;0.05). The results of MCS and MoCA were compared, and the scores of individuals from these tests were correlated (r(2)=0.57). "

ET patients received the Tremor Rating Scale for Tremor-motor examination (items 1-15 of rating scale) while 61 PD patients were examined with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)-motor examination and a modified Hoehn and Yahr scale for staging disorder severity. All participants completed Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Beijing version for measuring cognitive functions. And depression was evaluated by the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD). The serum levels of uric acid were tested.RESULTS: A MoCA score &lt;26 (at least mildly cognitive) was observed in 14 (23.3%) normal controls, compared to 24 (38.7%) ET cases and 27 (44.3%) PD cases (P = 0.045 when comparing all 3 groups, and P = 0.532 when comparing ET and PD). The factor scores of visual space/execution were 4.1 ± 1.0, 3.8 ± 1.1 and 3.2 ± 1.6 in normal controls, ET and PD patients, the factor scores of naming 2.9 ± 0.4, 2.8 ± 0.6 and 2.3 ± 0.8 in control, ET and PD patients, the factor scores of delay memory 3.9 ± 0.9, 2.7 ± 1.3 and 2.5 ± 1.7 in control, ET and PD patients. Statistical differences existed in visual space/execution, naming and delay memory (P &lt; 0.05) among 3 groups. Yet there were no statistical differences in attention, language, abstract and directional among 3 groups. Statistical differences existed in visual space/execution and naming between ET and PD patients (P &lt; 0.05). PD cases had the lowest visual space/execution score, followed by ET (intermediate) and highest scores in controls (P &lt; 0.05). In ET patients, cognitive scores were correlated with serum levels of uric acid, education, tremor Rating Scale for Tremor-motor subscale score and depression levels (r = 0.589, P = 0.000; r = 0.449, P = 0.010; r = 0.452, P = 0.009; r = 0.466, P = 0.025). In PD patients, cognitive scores correlated with serum levels of uric acid, education, score of UPDRS-III and depression levels (r = 0.694, P = 0.000; r = 0.614, P = 0.000; r = 0.604, P = 0.000; r = 0.376, P = 0.000).CONCLUSION: The incidence of cognition is higher in ET and PD. There were no significant inter-group differences for cognition frequency. The most frequently endorsed symptoms were poor visual spatial ability, execution disturbance and delayed recall disorders. Some connition scores in ET were intermediate between those of PD cases and normal controls. Thus a mild form of connition dysregulation may be present in ET. The degree of cognition symptoms is correlated with serum levels of uric acid, education and serious motor."
"25395414","White matter microstructural damage in small vessel disease is associated with Montreal cognitive assessment but not with mini mental state examination performances: vascular mild cognitive impairment Tuscany study.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has been proposed as a screening tool in vascular cognitive impairment. Diffusion tensor imaging is sensitive to white matter microstructural damage. We investigated if diffusion tensor imaging-derived indices are more strongly associated with performances on MoCA or on the widely used mini mental state examination in patients with mild cognitive impairment and small vessel disease.METHODS: Mild cognitive impairment patients with moderate/severe degrees of white matter hyperintensities on MRI were enrolled. Lacunar infarcts, cortical atrophy, medial temporal lobe atrophy and median values of mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy of the cerebral white matter were studied and correlated with cognitive tests performances.RESULTS: Seventy-six patients (mean age 75.1±6.8 years, mean years of education 8.0±4.3) were assessed. In univariate analyses, a significant association of both MoCA and mini mental state examination scores with age, education, cortical atrophy, and medial temporal lobe atrophy was found, whereas mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy were associated with MoCA. In partial correlation analyses, adjusting for all demographic and neuroimaging variables, both mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy were associated only with MoCA (mean diffusivity: r= -0.275, P=0.023; fractional anisotropy: r=0.246, P=0.043).CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mild cognitive impairment and small vessel disease, diffusion tensor imaging-measured white matter microstructural damage is more related to MoCA than mini mental state examination performances. MoCA is suited for the cognitive screening of patients with small vessel disease."
"25390883","Evaluation of a Brief Survey Instrument for Assessing Subtle Differences in Cognitive Function Among Older Adults.","Most measures of cognitive function used in large-scale surveys of older adults have limited ability to detect subtle differences across cognitive domains, and standard clinical instruments are impractical to administer in general surveys. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) can address this need, but has limitations in a survey context. Therefore, we developed a survey adaptation of the MoCA, called the MoCA-SA, and describe its psychometric properties in a large national survey. Using a pretest sample of older adults (n=120), we reduced MoCA administration time by 26%, developed a model to accurately estimate full MoCA scores from the MoCA-SA, and tested the model in an independent clinical sample (n=93). The validated 18-item MoCA-SA was then administered to community-dwelling adults aged 62 to 91 as part of the National Social life Health and Aging Project Wave 2 sample (n=3196). In National Social life Health and Aging Project Wave 2, the MoCA-SA had good internal reliability (Cronbach a=0.76). Using item-response models, survey-adapted items captured a broad range of cognitive abilities and functioned similarly across sex, education, and ethnic groups. Results demonstrate that the MoCA-SA can be administered reliably in a survey setting while preserving sensitivity to a broad range of cognitive abilities and similar performance across demographic subgroups.

"25380622","Normative data for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in an Italian population sample.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a rapid screening battery, also including subtests to assess frontal functions such as set-shifting, abstraction and cognitive flexibility. MoCA seems to be useful to identify non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and subcortical dementia; it has high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing MCI from mild Alzheimer's Disease. Previous studies revealed that certain items of MoCA may be culturally biased and highlighted the need for population-based norms for the MoCA. The aim of present study was to collect normative values in a sample of Italian healthy subjects. Four hundred and fifteen Italian healthy subjects (252 women and 163 men) of different ages (age range 21-95 years) and educational level (from primary to university) underwent MoCA and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that age and education significantly influenced performance on MoCA. No significant effect of gender was found. From the derived linear equation, a correction grid for MoCA raw scores was built. Inferential cut-off score, estimated using a non-parametric technique, is 15.5 and equivalent scores were computed. Correlation analysis showed a significant but weak correlation between MoCA adjusted scores with MMSE adjusted scores (r = 0.43, p &lt; 0.001). The present study provided normative data for the MoCA in an Italian population useful for both clinical and research purposes."

The CCFM was subsequently incorporated into NSHAP, Wave 2 (n = 3,377).RESULTS: The pre-test (n = 120) mean age was 71.35 (SD 8.40); 53% were female, 69% white, and 70% with college or greater education. The MoCA took an average of 15.6min; the time for the CCFM was 12.0 min. CCFM scores (0-20) can be used as a continuous outcome or to adjust for cognition in a multivariable analysis. CCFM scores were highly correlated with MoCA scores (r = .973). Modeling projects MoCA scores from CCFM scores using the equation: MoCA = (1.14 × CCFM) + 6.83. In Wave 2, the overall weighted mean CCFM score was 13.9 (SE 0.13).DISCUSSION: A survey-based adaptation of the MoCA was successfully integrated into a nationally representative sample of older adults, NSHAP Wave 2."

Tests of cognitive performance, urine albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR), and CKD-EPI eGFR were performed in unrelated AAs with T2D to determine relationships.METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of 263 unrelated AAs with T2D recruited in the African American-Diabetes Heart Study (AA-DHS) MIND. Global cognitive function (mini-mental state exam [3MSE] and Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]), memory (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test [RAVLT]), executive function (Stroop, verbal fluency for animals, and Digit Symbol Copy [DSC]), UACR, and eGFR were determined. Relationships between cognitive tests and renal parameters were assessed using multivariate models, adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, hemoglobin A1c, level of education, hypertension, and LDL cholesterol.RESULTS: Participants had a mean ± SD age of 60.2 ± 9.7 years, 62.7% were female, T2D duration was 14.3 ± 8.9 years, eGFR 86.0 ± 23.2 ml/min/1.73 m(2), and UACR 155.8 ± 542.1 (median 8.1) mg/g. In adjusted models, higher UACR was associated with worse 3MSE (p = 0.014), MoCA (p = 0.0089), DSC (p = 0.0004), Stroop performance time (p = 0.003), Stroop errors (p = 0.032), and Stroop interference (p = 0.026). Higher eGFR was associated with better performance on DSC (p = 0.0071).CONCLUSIONS: In AAs with T2D, albuminuria and eGFR were associated with cognitive function, even in mild kidney disease. These data stress the need for interventions to prevent cognitive decline well before the late stages of kidney disease."

Proper assessment of this condition may be complicated by illiteracy and cross-cultural factors. We conducted a population-based study in elders living in rural Ecuador to evaluate whether the MoCA associated with structural brain damage in less-educated populations.METHODS: Atahualpa residents aged =60 years were identified during a door-to-door survey and invited to undergo MRI for grading GCA. Using a multivariate generalized linear model, we evaluated whether MoCA scores correlates with GCA, after adjusting for demographics, education, cardiovascular health (CVH) status, depression and edentulism.RESULTS: Out of 311 eligible persons, 241 (78%) were enrolled. Mean age was 69.2±7.5 years, 141 (59%) were women, 199 (83%) had primary school education, 175 (73%) had poor CVH status, 30 (12%) had symptoms of depression and 104 (43%) had edentulism. Average MoCA scores were 18.5±4.7 points. GCA was mild in 108, moderate in 95, and severe in 26 persons. Total and most domain-specific MoCA scores were significantly worse in persons with moderate to severe GCA. In the multivariate model, mean MoCA score was associated with GCA severity (ß=2.38, SE=1.07, p=0.027).CONCLUSIONS: MoCA scores associate with severity of GCA after adjusting for potential confounders, and may be used as reliable estimates of structural brain damage. However, a lower cut-off than that recommended for developed countries, would be better for recognizing cognitive impairment in less educated populations."

In addition, the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease plus Scale (CERAD plus) were administered to subgroups of patients. Results showed that administration of ECAS was fast (mean 24 min). Similar to the population in the UK version, ALS patients performed significantly worse in the ALS-specific functions (p &lt; 0.001), specifically in the domain of language (p &lt; 0.001), verbal fluency (p = 0.005) and executive functions (p = 0.02), but not for the non-ALS-specific functions. Carers reported behavioural abnormalities in about 30% and psychotic symptoms in 6% of the patients. Compared to ECAS, FAB, MoCA and CERAD were more generic and performance was not adjusted to motor speed. We conclude that the German/Swiss-German version of the ECAS is a fast and easy to administer cognitive screening instrument sensitive for ALS-specific dysfunctions and behaviour change. "

The new criteria for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition (DSM-5) mild neurocognitive disorder (NCD) define participants with cognitive decline but no dementia, and major NCD (dementia). We explored the usefulness of MOCA to detect major and mild NCD.DESIGN: Cross-sectional test research.SETTING: Tertiary hospital memory clinic and community-based Singapore Longitudinal Aging Study (SLAS).PARTICIPANTS: Participants with questionable dementia (clinical dementia rating, CDR = 0.5) and early dementia (CDR =1) over a period of 1 year were identified from the memory clinic registry. The patient records were reviewed and the diagnostic labels of major and mild NCD were applied accordingly. Healthy controls (HC) (CDR = 0, Mini-Mental State Examination &gt;26) were recruited from the on-going SLAS.MEASUREMENTS: Major and mild NCD were diagnosed based on medical history, clinical examination, basic and instrumental activities of daily living, locally validated bedside cognitive tests (Mini-Mental State Examination, Frontal Assessment Battery, and Clock Drawing Test), relevant laboratory investigations and standardized neuropsychological assessment.RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-one participants were included (41 mild NCD, 64 major NCD, 146 HC). On receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the diagnostic performance by area under the curve (AUC) for MOCA was 0.99 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98-1.0] for major NCD and 0.77 (95% CI 0.67-0.86) for mild NCD. For diagnosis of mild NCD, MOCA performed better in those with lower education (primary and below) (AUC 0.90) compared with those with secondary education and beyond (AUC 0.66).CONCLUSION: MOCA has high diagnostic utility for major NCD but its usefulness in detecting mild NCD is more modest. Possible reasons include greater heterogeneity in participants with mild NCD and how &quot;quantified clinical assessment&quot; in the DSM-5 mild NCD criteria is interpreted and operationalized."

Amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) were computed from fMRI signals to measure spontaneous neuronal activity. Differences in the ALFF patterns between patients and controls, as well as their correlations with clinical variables, were evaluated.RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, T2DM patients exhibited significantly decreased ALFF values mainly in the frontal and parietal lobes, the bilateral thalumi, the posterior lobe of the cerebellum, and increased ALFF values mainly in the visual cortices. Furthermore, lower ALFF values in the left subcallosal gyrus correlated with lower ankle-brachial index values (r = 0.481, p = 0.020), while lower ALFF values in the bilateral medial prefrontal gyri correlated with higher urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (r =<U+200A> -0.418, p = 0.047). In addition, most of the regions with increased ALFF values in the visual cortices were found to negatively correlate with MoCA scores.CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that ALFF are altered in many brain regions in T2DM patients, and this is associated with the presence of diabetic vascular disease and poor cognitive performance. These findings may provide additional insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms that mediate T2DM-related cognitive dysfunction, and may also serve as a reference for future research."
"25249353","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is superior to the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) in detection of Korsakoff's syndrome.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) are brief screening instruments for cognitive disorders. Although these instruments have frequently been used in the detection of dementia, there is currently little knowledge on the validity to detect Korsakoff's syndrome (KS) with both screening instruments. KS is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder associated with profound declarative amnesia after thiamine deficiency. A representative sample of 30 patients with KS and 30 age-, education-, gender- and premorbid-IQ-matched controls was administered the MoCA and MMSE. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated in addition to the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for various cut-off points on the MoCA and MMSE. Compared with the MMSE, the MoCA demonstrated consistently superior psychometric properties and discriminant validity--AUC: MoCA (1.00 SE .003) and MMSE (0.92 SE .033). When applying a cut-off value as suggested in the manuals of both instruments, the MMSE (&lt; 24) misdiagnosed 46.7% of the patients, while the MoCA (&lt; 26) diagnosed all patients correctly. As a screening instrument with the most optimal cut-offs, the MoCA (optimal cutoff point 22/23, 98.3% correctly diagnosed) was superior to the MMSE (optimal cutoff point 26/27, 83.3% correctly diagnosed). We conclude that both tests have adequate psychometric properties as a screening instrument for the detection of KS, but the MoCA is superior to the MMSE for this specific patient population."

Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that the number of present teeth (odds ratio [OR] 0.97, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.95-0.99), difficulty in mastication (OR 3.20, CI 2.18-4.70), presence of xerostomia (OR 1.43, CI 1.02-2.01), total score on the MoCA-J (OR 1.06, CI 1.01-1.11), and reduction in frequency of leaving the house (OR 1.64, CI 1.12-2.41) were significantly associated with poor self-rated oral health.CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggested that self-rated oral health was a significant factor in oral health status as well as overall well-being among community-dwelling older Japanese people."
"25155360","Influence of depression, anxiety and stress on cognitive performance in community-dwelling older adults living in rural Ecuador: results of the Atahualpa Project.","AIM: To assess the relationship between cognitive status and self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress of older adults living in an underserved rural South American population.METHODS: Community-dwelling Atahualpa residents aged =60<U+2009>years were identified during a door-to-door census, and evaluated with the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). We explored whether positivity in each of the DASS-21 axes was related to total and domain-specific MoCA performance after adjustment for age, sex and education.RESULTS: A total of 280 persons (59% women; mean age, mean age 70<U+2009>±<U+2009>8<U+2009>years) were included. Based on established cut-offs for the DASS-21, 12% persons had depression, 15% had anxiety and 5% had stress. Mean total MoCA scores were significantly lower for depressed than for not depressed individuals (15.9<U+2009>±<U+2009>5.5 vs 18.9<U+2009>±<U+2009>4.4, P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.0001). Depressed participants had significantly lower total and domain-specific MoCA scores for abstraction, short-term memory and orientation. Anxiety was related to significantly lower total MoCA scores (17<U+2009>±<U+2009>4.7 vs 18.8<U+2009>±<U+2009>4.5, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02), but not to differences in domain-specific MoCA scores. Stress was not associated with significant differences in MoCA scores.CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that depression and anxiety are associated with poorer cognitive performance in elderly residents living in rural areas of developing countries."
"25147113","Optimal cutoff scores for dementia and mild cognitive impairment of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment among elderly and oldest-old Chinese population.","BACKGROUND: All versions of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) lack population-based data of 80-plus individuals. The norms and cut-off scores for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia of the MoCA are different among five Chinese versions.OBJECTIVE: To provide the cut-off scores in detecting MCI and dementia of the Peking Medical Union College Hospital version of the MoCA (MoCA-P).METHODS: In a cross-sectional survey, Chinese veterans aged =60 years completed the MoCA-P and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).RESULTS: Among 7,445 elderly veterans, 5,085 (68.30%) were aged =80 years old, 2,621 (35.20%) had 6 years of education or less, 6,847 (91.97%) were male, and 2,311 (31.04%) and 984 (13.22%) veterans were diagnosed as having MCI and dementia, respectively. Adding two points and one point to the MoCA scores for the primary and middle school groups, respectively, can fully adjust for the notable impact of education but cannot compensate for the effect of age. In the three age groups (60-79, 80-89, and =90 years old), the optimal MoCA-P cut-off scores for detecting MCI were =25, =24, and =23, respectively, and for detecting dementia were =24, =21, and =19, respectively, which demonstrated relatively high sensitivities and specificities. The areas under the curves for the MoCA-P for detecting MCI and dementia (0.937 and 0.908, respectively) were greater than those for the MMSE (0.848 and 0.892, respectively).CONCLUSION: Compared with the MMSE, the MoCA-P is significantly better for detecting MCI in the elderly, particularly in the oldest old population, and it also displays more effectiveness in detecting dementia."
"25139107","Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)-Italian version: regression based norms and equivalent scores.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a brief cognitive screening instrument developed by Nasreddine et al. to detect mild cognitive impairment, a high-risk condition for Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. In this study we report normative data on the MoCA-Italian version, collected on a sample of 225 Italian healthy subjects ranged in age between 60 and 80 years, and in formal education from 5 to 23 years. The global normal cognition was established in accordance with the Mini-Mental State Examination score and with the Prose Memory Test score (Spinnler and Tognoni, Ital J Neurol Sci 6:25-27, 1987). None of the participants had a history of psychiatric, neurological, cerebrovascular disorders or brain injury or took drugs affecting cognition. Linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the potential effect of age, education and sex on the MoCA total performance score. We provide correction grids to adjust raw scores and equivalent scores with cut-off value to allow comparison between MoCA performance and others neuropsychological test scores that can be administered on the same subject."
"25126077","A new clinical tool for assessing numerical abilities in neurological diseases: numerical activities of daily living.","The aim of this study was to build an instrument, the numerical activities of daily living (NADL), designed to identify the specific impairments in numerical functions that may cause problems in everyday life. These impairments go beyond what can be inferred from the available scales evaluating activities of daily living in general, and are not adequately captured by measures of the general deterioration of cognitive functions as assessed by standard clinical instruments like the MMSE and MoCA. We assessed a control group (n = 148) and a patient group affected by a wide variety of neurological conditions (n = 175), with NADL along with IADL, MMSE, and MoCA. The NADL battery was found to have satisfactory construct validity and reliability, across a wide age range. This enabled us to calculate appropriate criteria for impairment that took into account age and education. It was found that neurological patients tended to overestimate their abilities as compared to the judgment made by their caregivers, assessed with objective tests of numerical abilities. "
"25125421","A validation study of the Hong Kong version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (HK-MoCA) in Chinese older adults in Hong Kong.","OBJECTIVE: To validate the Hong Kong version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (HK-MoCA) in identification of mild cognitive impairment and dementia in Chinese older adults.DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.SETTING: Cognition clinic and memory clinic of a public hospital in Hong Kong.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 272 participants (dementia, n=130; mild cognitive impairment, n=93; normal controls, n=49) aged 60 years or above were assessed using HK-MoCA. The HK-MoCA scores were validated against expert diagnosis according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed) criteria for dementia and Petersen's criteria for mild cognitive impairment. Statistical analysis was performed using receiver operating characteristic curve and regression analyses. Additionally, comparison was made with the Cantonese version of Mini-Mental State Examination and Global Deterioration Scale.RESULTS: The optimal cutoff score for the HK-MoCA to differentiate cognitive impaired persons (mild cognitive impairment and dementia) from normal controls was 21/22 after adjustment of education level, giving a sensitivity of 0.928, specificity of 0.735, and area under the curve of 0.920. Moreover, the cutoff to detect mild cognitive impairment was 21/22 with a sensitivity of 0.828, specificity of 0.735, and area under the curve of 0.847. Score of the Cantonese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination to detect mild cognitive impairment was 26/27 with a sensitivity of 0.785, specificity of 0.816, and area under the curve of 0.857. At the optimal cutoff of 18/19, HK-MoCA identified dementia from controls with a sensitivity of 0.923, specificity of 0.918, and area under the curve of 0.971.CONCLUSION: The HK-MoCA is a useful cognitive screening instrument for use in Chinese older adults in Hong Kong. A score of less than 22 should prompt further diagnostic assessment. It has comparable sensitivity with the Cantonese version of Mini-Mental State Examination for detection of mild cognitive impairment. It is brief and feasible to conduct in the clinical setting, and can be completed in less than 15 minutes. Thus, HK-MoCA provides an attractive alternative screening instrument to Mini-Mental State Examination which has ceiling effect (ie may fail to detect mild/moderate cognitive impairment in people with high education level or premorbid intelligence) and needs to be purchased due to copyright issues."
"25092174","A pilot study to measure cognitive impairment in patients with severe schizophrenia with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).","Cognitive impairment has been suggested to be a core feature of a schizophrenia diagnosis. Many comprehensive neuropsychological batteries and experimental procedures have been used to assess cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. A few brief performance-based cognitive assessments have been developed to fulfill the need of a more feasible cognitive assessment for schizophrenia in clinical settings. However, their usability is in question. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a brief cognitive assessment tool, has been used widely in different clinical settings because of its high sensitivity and specificity for detecting cognitive impairments. This study assessed cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia by using the MoCA tool. The results showed that the MoCA was sensitive enough to detect cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia. It also provided normative data for the MoCA in schizophrenia patients. Furthermore, the results revealed that cognitive impairment measured by the MoCA was correlated with their education level, severity of illness, and negative symptoms. Lastly, the MoCA total score could be a significant predictor of patients' length of stay in the facility. "
"25088285","Cognitive functioning in complicated grief.","Complicated grief (CG) is increasingly recognized as a debilitating outcome of bereavement. Given the intensity of the stressor, its chronicity, and its association with depression, it is important to know the impact CG may have on cognitive functioning. This exploratory and descriptive study examined global and domain-specific cognitive functioning in a help-seeking sample of individuals with CG (n = 335) compared to a separately ascertained control sample (n = 250). Cognitive functioning was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Controlling for age, sex and education effects, CG participants had lower total MoCA, visuospatial and attention scores relative to control participants. The two groups did not differ significantly in the domains of executive function, language, memory or orientation. Age, sex, and education accounted for much of the variance in MoCA scores, while CG severity and chronicity accounted for a very small percentage of MoCA score variance. Major depression was not a significant predictor of MoCA scores. This study is consistent with previous work demonstrating lower attention and global cognitive performance in individuals with CG compared to control participants. This study newly identifies the visuospatial domain as a target for future studies investigating cognitive functioning in CG."
"25040216","Feasibility of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in acute stroke patients.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cognitive deficits are common following stroke. Cognitive function in the acute stroke setting is a predictive factor for mid-term outcome. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a screening tool for cognitive impairment. The feasibility of MoCA in the acute phase of stroke was evaluated and factors predictive of cognitive impairment were determined.METHODS: In this prospective, single-centre, explorative and observational study consecutive patients with ischaemic (IS) or haemorrhagic (ICH) stroke were enrolled between March 2011 and September 2012. The routine work-up for each patient encompassed assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the pre-morbid modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Cognitive performance was measured using the German version of the MoCA within the first days of admission. A MoCA score of &lt;26 was considered to indicate cognitive impairment.RESULTS: Between March 2011 and September 2012 a total of 842 patients with IS (89.0%) and ICH (11.0%) were enrolled in our study. MoCA was feasible in 678/842 patients (80.5%). Factors independently associated with non-feasibility were stroke severity (NIHSS), pre-morbid functional status (mRS), age and lower educational level. Mean MoCA was 21.4 (SD 5.7). A total of 498/678 (73.5%) patients appeared cognitively impaired (&lt;26/30). Independent predictive factors for a lower MoCA score were age, educational level, stroke severity (NIHSS) and pre-morbid functional status (mRS).CONCLUSIONS: In the acute phase of stroke, MoCA is feasible in about 80% of eligible patients. At this stage, MoCA identifies a cognitive impairment in 75% of patients."
"25033379","Cognitive impairment in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","PURPOSE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), especially in severe forms, is commonly associated with multiple cognitive problems. Montreal Cognitive Assessment test (MoCA) is used to detect cognitive impairment evaluating several areas: visuospatial, memory, attention and fluency. Our study aim was to evaluate the impact of stable COPD and exacerbation (AECOPD) phases on cognitive status using MoCA questionnaire.METHODS: We enrolled 39 patients (pts), smokers with COPD group D (30 stable and 9 in AECOPD) and 13 healthy subjects (control group), having similar level of education and no significant differences regarding the anthropometric measurements. We analyzed the differences in MoCA score between these three groups and also the correlation between this score and inflammatory markers.RESULTS: Patients with AECOPD had a significant (p&lt;0.001) decreased MoCA score (14.6±3.4) compared to stable COPD (20.2±2.4) and controls (24.2±5.8). The differences between groups were more accentuated for the language abstraction and attention (p&lt;0.001) and delayed recall and orientation (p&lt;0.001) sub-topics. No significant variance of score was observed between groups regarding visuospatial and naming score (p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.095). The MoCA score was significantly correlated with forced expiratory volume (r<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.28) and reverse correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP) (r<U+200A>=<U+200A>-0.57), fibrinogen (r<U+200A>=<U+200A>-0.58), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (r<U+200A>=<U+200A>-0.55) and with the partial pressure of CO2 (r<U+200A>=<U+200A>-0.47).CONCLUSIONS: According to this study, COPD significantly decreases the cognitive status in advanced and acute stages of the disease."
"25023857","Cognitive screening for dementia in primary care: a systematic review.","BACKGROUND: Identifying dementia in primary care could minimize the impact of a late intervention; however, it shows high rates of misdiagnosis. One of the reasons seems to be the lack of knowledge of adequate cognitive screening instruments. This is a systematic review of the available instruments for the primary care context.METHOD: For this systematic review, articles were collected according to the following combined key terms: &quot;cognitive screening&quot; and &quot;dementia&quot; and &quot;primary care&quot; and &quot;review&quot;. Studies should be reviews focusing on cognitive screening instruments best used in primary care setting.RESULTS: Thirteen reviews were selected. In total, it was considered 34 cognitive screening instruments. Half of the instruments can be applied in an adequate time-limit for primary care context. Memory is the most commonly assessed cognitive function (91%). Almost half of the tests are mentioned to have influence of education or cultural factors (44%).CONCLUSION: Tests such as 6CIT, AMT, GPCOG, Mini-Cog, MIS, MoCA, and STMS seem to be good alternatives to the use of the Mini-Mental State Examination when considering factors such as application time, sensitivity, specificity, and number of studies. However, there is a wide range of tests with different characteristics, therefore it is recommended that the professional gets some expertise in a few number of instruments in order to be able to choose which to use, or use in combination, depending on the setting and the profile of the patient."
"24991170","Using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale to screen for dementia in Chinese patients with Parkinson's Disease.","BACKGROUND: Dementia is one of the most distressing and burdensome health problems associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale (MoCA) is widely used to screen for dementia in PD patients, but the appropriate diagnostic cutoff score when used with Chinese PD patients is not known.AIM: Determine a diagnostic cutoff value of the Chinese version of the MoCA (MoCA-C) for Chinese PD patients and describe the characteristics of PD patients screened positive for dementia using the MoCA-C.METHODS: The presence of dementia in 616 PD patients and 85 community controls was determined using the Movement Disorder Society Task Force criteria (the gold standard diagnosis). We administered the MoCA-C to these individuals and used a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to identify the cutoff score of the MoCA-C that most efficiently identified dementia in both PD patients and community controls. Demographic and clinical characteristics of PD patients who were screened positive or negative for dementia using the MoCA-C were compared.RESULTS: A MoCA-C score of 23 was the optimal cutoff score for dementia in both patients and controls. Using this cutoff score, the sensitivity and specificity of the MoCA-C in PD patients were 0.70 and 0.77, respectively; the positive and negative predictive values were 0.59 and 0.85, respectively; and the overall concordance (kappa [95% confidence interval]) was 0.45 (0.39-0.52). The corresponding kappa value (concordance) in community controls was only 0.25 (0.05-0.45). Compared to PD patients who screened negative for dementia, those who screened positive for dementia were significantly impaired in all cognitive domains, including visuospatial and executive functioning, naming, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall and orientation (all p&lt;0.001). Among the PD patients, screening positive for dementia was independently associated with old age, low educational attainment, female gender and more severe motor impairment.CONCLUSIONS: The commonly recommended cutoff screening score for dementia of 26 on the MoCA it too high for PD patients in China; a cutoff score of 23 is more appropriate. Potential risk factors for dementia in Chinese PD patients include older age, less education, and more severe motor symptoms of PD.MoCA-C 23<U+5206><U+662F><U+8BCA><U+65AD><U+5E15><U+91D1><U+68EE><U+6C0F><U+60A3><U+8005><U+53CA><U+5BF9><U+7167><U+7EC4><U+75F4><U+5446><U+7684><U+6700><U+4F73><U+5212><U+754C><U+5206><U+3002><U+4F7F><U+7528><U+8BE5><U+5212><U+754C><U+5206>,PD<U+60A3><U+8005><U+7684>MoCA-C<U+654F><U+611F><U+6027><U+548C><U+7279><U+5F02><U+6027><U+5206><U+522B><U+4E3A>0.70<U+548C>0.77,<U+9633><U+6027><U+548C><U+9634><U+6027><U+9884><U+6D4B><U+503C><U+5206><U+522B><U+4E3A>0.59<U+548C>0.85,<U+6574><U+4F53><U+4E00><U+81F4><U+6027>(kappa [95% <U+53EF><U+4FE1><U+533A><U+95F4>])<U+4E3A>0.45 (0.39-0.52)<U+3002><U+793E><U+533A><U+5BF9><U+7167><U+76F8><U+5E94><U+7684>kappa<U+503C> (<U+4E00><U+81F4><U+6027>)<U+4EC5><U+4E3A>0.25 (0.05-0.45)<U+3002><U+4E0E><U+7B5B><U+67E5><U+4E3A><U+75F4><U+5446><U+9634><U+6027><U+7684>PD<U+60A3><U+8005><U+76F8><U+6BD4>,<U+7B5B><U+67E5><U+4E3A><U+75F4><U+5446><U+9633><U+6027><U+7684>PD<U+60A3><U+8005><U+6240><U+6709><U+8BA4><U+77E5><U+529F><U+80FD><U+90FD><U+6709><U+663E><U+8457><U+53D7><U+635F>,<U+5305><U+62EC><U+89C6><U+89C9><U+7A7A><U+95F4><U+548C><U+6267><U+884C><U+529F><U+80FD>,<U+547D><U+540D>,<U+6CE8><U+610F><U+529B>,<U+8BED><U+8A00>,<U+62BD><U+8C61>,<U+5EF6><U+8FDF><U+56DE><U+5FC6><U+548C><U+5B9A><U+5411> (<U+5747>P&lt;0.001)<U+3002><U+5728><U+5E15><U+91D1><U+68EE><U+6C0F><U+75C7><U+60A3><U+8005><U+4E2D>,<U+7B5B><U+67E5><U+4E3A><U+75F4><U+5446><U+9633><U+6027><U+4E0E><U+5E74><U+8001>,<U+6587><U+5316><U+7A0B><U+5EA6><U+4F4E>,<U+5973><U+6027><U+4EE5><U+53CA><U+4E25><U+91CD><U+8FD0><U+52A8><U+969C><U+788D><U+72EC><U+7ACB><U+76F8><U+5173><U+3002></AbstractText>: MoCA-C 23<U+5206><U+662F><U+8BCA><U+65AD><U+5E15><U+91D1><U+68EE><U+6C0F><U+60A3><U+8005><U+53CA><U+5BF9><U+7167><U+7EC4><U+75F4><U+5446><U+7684><U+6700><U+4F73><U+5212><U+754C><U+5206><U+3002><U+4F7F><U+7528><U+8BE5><U+5212><U+754C><U+5206>,PD<U+60A3><U+8005><U+7684>MoCA-C<U+654F><U+611F><U+6027><U+548C><U+7279><U+5F02><U+6027><U+5206><U+522B><U+4E3A>0.70<U+548C>0.77,<U+9633><U+6027><U+548C><U+9634><U+6027><U+9884><U+6D4B><U+503C><U+5206><U+522B><U+4E3A>0.59<U+548C>0.85,<U+6574><U+4F53><U+4E00><U+81F4><U+6027>(kappa [95% <U+53EF><U+4FE1><U+533A><U+95F4>])<U+4E3A>0.45 (0.39-0.52)<U+3002><U+793E><U+533A><U+5BF9><U+7167><U+76F8><U+5E94><U+7684>kappa<U+503C> (<U+4E00><U+81F4><U+6027>)<U+4EC5><U+4E3A>0.25 (0.05-0.45)<U+3002><U+4E0E><U+7B5B><U+67E5><U+4E3A><U+75F4><U+5446><U+9634><U+6027><U+7684>PD<U+60A3><U+8005><U+76F8><U+6BD4>,<U+7B5B><U+67E5><U+4E3A><U+75F4><U+5446><U+9633><U+6027><U+7684>PD<U+60A3><U+8005><U+6240><U+6709><U+8BA4><U+77E5><U+529F><U+80FD><U+90FD><U+6709><U+663E><U+8457><U+53D7><U+635F>,<U+5305><U+62EC><U+89C6><U+89C9><U+7A7A><U+95F4><U+548C><U+6267><U+884C><U+529F><U+80FD>,<U+547D><U+540D>,<U+6CE8><U+610F><U+529B>,<U+8BED><U+8A00>,<U+62BD><U+8C61>,<U+5EF6><U+8FDF><U+56DE><U+5FC6><U+548C><U+5B9A><U+5411> (<U+5747>P&lt;0.001)<U+3002><U+5728><U+5E15><U+91D1><U+68EE><U+6C0F><U+75C7><U+60A3><U+8005><U+4E2D>,<U+7B5B><U+67E5><U+4E3A><U+75F4><U+5446><U+9633><U+6027><U+4E0E><U+5E74><U+8001>,<U+6587><U+5316><U+7A0B><U+5EA6><U+4F4E>,<U+5973><U+6027><U+4EE5><U+53CA><U+4E25><U+91CD><U+8FD0><U+52A8><U+969C><U+788D><U+72EC><U+7ACB><U+76F8><U+5173><U+3002>"
"24982978","The influence of education on Chinese version of Montreal cognitive assessment in detecting amnesic mild cognitive impairment among older people in a Beijing rural community.","To assess the influence of education on the performance of Chinese version of Montreal cognitive assessment (C-MoCA) in relation to the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) in detecting amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) among rural-dwelling older people C-MoCA and MMSE was administered and diagnostic interviews were conducted among community-dwelling elderly in two villages in Beijing. The performance of C-MoCA and MMSE in detecting aMCI was evaluated by the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Effect size of education on variations in C-MoCA scores was estimated with general linear model. Among 172 study participants (24 cases of aMCI and 148 normal controls), the AUC of C-MoCA was 0.72 (95% CI = 0.62-0.81, cutoff = 20/21), compared to AUC of MMSE of 0.74 (95% CI = 0.64-0.84, cutoff = 26/27). The performance of both C-MoCA and MMSE was especially poorer among those with low (0-6 years) education. After controlling for gender and age, education ( <U+03B7>(2) = 0.204) had a surpassing effect over aMCI diagnosis ( <U+03B7>(2) = 0.052) on variations in C-MoCA scores. Among rural older people, the MoCA showed modest accuracy and was no better than MMSE in detecting aMCI, especially in those with low education, due to the overwhelming effect of education relative to aMCI diagnosis on variations in C-MoCA performance."
"24982631","Mesenchymal stem cells can modulate longitudinal changes in cortical thickness and its related cognitive decline in patients with multiple system atrophy.","Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an adult-onset, sporadic neurodegenerative disease. Because the prognosis of MSA is fatal, neuroprotective or regenerative strategies may be invaluable in MSA treatment. Previously, we obtained clinical and imaging evidence that mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) treatment could have a neuroprotective role in MSA patients. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of MSC therapy on longitudinal changes in subcortical deep gray matter volumes and cortical thickness and their association with cognitive performance. Clinical and imaging data were obtained from our previous randomized trial of autologous MSC in MSA patients. During 1-year follow-up, we assessed longitudinal differences in automatic segmentation-based subcortical deep gray matter volumes and vertex-wise cortical thickness between placebo (n = 15) and MSC groups (n = 11). Next, we performed correlation analysis between the changes in cortical thickness and changes in the Korean version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores and cognitive performance of each cognitive subdomain using a multiple, comparison correction. There were no significant differences in age at baseline, age at disease onset, gender ratio, disease duration, clinical severity, MoCA score, or education level between the groups. The automated subcortical volumetric analysis revealed that the changes in subcortical deep gray matter volumes of the caudate, putamen, and thalamus did not differ significantly between the groups. The areas of cortical thinning over time in the placebo group were more extensive, including the frontal, temporal, and parietal areas, whereas these areas in the MSC group were less extensive. Correlation analysis indicated that declines in MoCA scores and phonemic fluency during the follow-up period were significantly correlated with cortical thinning of the frontal and posterior temporal areas and anterior temporal areas in MSA patients, respectively. In contrast, no significant correlations were observed in the MSC group. These results suggest that MSC treatment in patients with MSA may modulate cortical thinning over time and related cognitive performance, inferring a future therapeutic candidate for cognitive disorders.

"24938319","Alterations in the gray matter volume in transient ischemic attack: a voxel-based morphometry study.","BACKGROUND: Several studies have emphasized that transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients suffered functional impairments, but whether underlying morphological alterations exist remains unclear. This study aims to detect possible gray matter volume (GMV) alterations in patients with TIA using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) method.METHODS: High-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images of 21 patients were compared with 21 healthy controls of matching age, gender, and education. Changes in the GMV were observed using VBM technique, followed by two-sample t-test analysis to detect the differences in the GMV between TIA patients and healthy controls. Correlations between the clinical parameters and the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scores, and the altered GMV in TIAs, were investigated.RESULTS: Two-sample t-test analysis revealed a significant GMV reduction in specific regions in the default mode network (DMN) in TIA patients, including the bilateral medial frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and precuneus. No correlation was found between the reduced GMV and MoCA scores and clinical parameters.CONCLUSION: Transient ischemic attack patients showed widespread morphology atrophy in DMN, suggesting that, despite the absence of a cerebral infarction, ischemic injury may induce structural abnormalities and eventually contribute to functional impairments in TIA patients. Our results may provide a valuable basis for the pathophysiological mechanism related to the cognitive dysfunction of TIA from the view of brain morphology."
"24916485","Veterans Affairs Saint Louis University Mental Status examination compared with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the Short Test of Mental Status.","OBJECTIVES: To compare the ability of the Veterans Affairs Saint Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS) examination to detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia according to the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) with that of two other well-known screening instruments, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Short Test of Mental Status (STMS).DESIGN: Cross-sectional validation study.SETTING: Saint Louis Veterans Affairs Medical Center Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center.PARTICIPANTS: Veterans aged 60 and older (median 78.5) with a high school education or more (n = 136).MEASUREMENTS: Participants were administered the SLUMS examination, the MoCA, and the STMS in random order. A blinded test administrator administered the CDR in a separate session. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the SLUMS examination, the MoCA, and the STMS for MCI, dementia, and MCI or dementia. ROC contrasts were used to statistically compare the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the screening tests' ability to detect cognitive dysfunction according to the CDR.RESULTS: ROC contrasts demonstrated that the AUCs for detecting MCI (SLUMS examination 0.74, MoCA 0.77, STMS 0.77), dementia (SLUMS examination 0.98, MoCA 0.96, STMS 0.97), and MCI or dementia (SLUMS examination 0.82, MoCA 0.83, STMS 0.84) were equivalent. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were similar across measures of MCI, dementia, and MCI or dementia according to the CDR.CONCLUSION: The SLUMS examination has validity similar to that of the MoCA and STMS for the detection of MCI, dementia, and MCI or dementia according to the CDR."

The aim of this study is to examine the acupuncture effect on the default mode network (DMN) in AD by using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI).METHODS: Twenty-eight subjects (14 AD and 14 normal controls (NC)) participated in this study. RS-fMRI data were acquired before and after acupuncture, while during the acupuncture, the procession of acupuncture stimulation on the acupoints of Tai chong (Liv3) and Hegu (LI4) lasted for 3 minutes.RESULTS: Region of interest analysis showed that the impaired DMN connectivity in AD (identified by comparing the pre-acupuncture RS-fMRI of AD and NC), specifically the left cingulate gyrus (CG) and right inferior parietal lobule (IPL), were significantly changed for the better. The whole-brain exploratory analysis further demonstrated these results and found some new regions respond to the acupuncture effect on AD, with a cluster in the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG) together with right IPL showed increased within-DMN connectivity; and the bilateral CG and left PCu showed decreased within-DMN connectivity. Moreover, the acupuncture effect on the right MTG was significantly correlated with disease severity as measured by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores.CONCLUSION: It was found that the acupuncture stimulation could modulate the DMN activity in AD. The current findings suggest that the acupuncture treatment on the relative earlier AD patients might have a better therapy effect."
"24826506","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment in persons with traumatic brain injury.","The objective of this study was to examine the performance of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The MoCA was administered to 214 patients with TBI during their acute care hospitalization in a Level 1 trauma center. The results showed that patients with severe TBI had lower scores on the MoCA compared with patients with mild and moderate TBI, F(2, 211) = 10.35, p = .0001. This difference was found for visuospatial/executive, attention, and orientation subtests (p &lt; .05). Linear regression demonstrated that age, education, TBI severity, and the presence of neurological antecedents were the best predictors of cognitive impairments explaining 42% of the total variability of the MoCA. This information can enable clinicians to predict early cognitive impairments and plan cognitive rehabilitation earlier in the recovery process."
"24806666","Contributions of the Computer-Administered Neuropsychological Screen for Mild Cognitive Impairment (CANS-MCI) for the diagnosis of MCI in Brazil.","ABSTRACT Background: The Computer-Administered Neuropsychological Screen for Mild Cognitive Impairment (CANS-MCI) is a computer-based cognitive screening instrument that involves automated administration and scoring and immediate analyses of test sessions. The objective of this study was to translate and culturally adapt the Brazilian Portuguese version of the CANS-MCI (CANS-MCI-BR) and to evaluate its reliability and validity for the diagnostic screening of MCI and dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Methods: The test was administered to 97 older adults (mean age 73.41 ± 5.27 years) with at least four years of formal education (mean education 12.23 ± 4.48 years). Participants were classified into three diagnostic groups according to global cognitive status (normal controls, n = 41; MCI, n = 35; AD, n = 21) based on clinical data and formal neuropsychological assessments. Results: The results indicated high internal consistency (Cronbach's a = 0.77) in the total sample. Three-month test-retest reliability correlations were significant and robust (0.875; p &lt; 0.001). A moderate level of concurrent validity was attained relative to the screening test for MCI (MoCA test, r = 0.76, p &lt; 0.001). Confirmatory factor analysis supported the three-factor model of the original test, i.e., memory, language/spatial fluency, and executive function/mental control. Goodness of fit indicators were strong (Bentler Comparative Fit Index = 0.96, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.09). Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses suggested high sensitivity and specificity (81% and 73% respectively) to screen for possible MCI cases. Conclusions: The CANS-MCI-BR maintains adequate psychometric characteristics that render it suitable to identify elderly adults with probable cognitive impairment to whom a more extensive evaluation by formal neuropsychological tests may be required."
"24745159","[The effect of prolactin and apolipoprotein E gene polymorphism on cognitive functions of menopausal women].","OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to analyze a possible association between cognitive functions and level of prolactin in menopausal women with different polymorphisms of apolipoprotein E gene (APOE). The examined population included women from the south-eastern part of Poland; aged 50-65 years; at least 2 years after their last menstruation; in good health; with at least primary education, FSH &gt; 30 mIU/ml. The MoCA test (Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test) allowed us to exclude women with signs of dementia. The cognitive functions assessment was conducted with the CNS-VitalSigns diagnostic equipment (Polish version). The prolactin designations were conducted by SYNEVO--an accredited laboratory. The examination of APOE polymorphism was performed using the multiplex-PCR method. The results were statistically analyzed.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Higher level of prolactin turned out to be associated with better test results in the following areas: NCI, memory verbal memory psychomotor speed and concentration. Women with higher level of prolactin had better results in NCI, psychomotor speed and verbal memory tests. The test results of other cognitive function were not unequivocally related to higher levels of prolactin. Thus, it was not possible to conclude that the presence of APOE polymorphism is related to the effect of prolactin on cognitive functions of the examined menopausal women."
"24733650","Uric formaldehyde levels are negatively correlated with cognitive abilities in healthy older adults.","Recent studies have shown that the abnormal accumulation of endogenous formaldehyde could be a critical factor in age-related cognitive decline. The aim of this study was to estimate the correlation between uric formaldehyde and general cognitive abilities in a community-based elderly population, and to measure the extent and direction in which the correlation varied with demographic characteristics. Using a double-blind design, formaldehyde in human urine was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (n = 604), and general cognitive abilities were measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Demographic characteristics, in terms of age, gender, residential region, and education were taken into consideration. We found that uric formaldehyde levels were inversely correlated with the MoCA score, and the concentration varied with demographic features: higher odds of a high formaldehyde level occurred among the less educated and those living in old urban or rural areas. In cytological experiments, the level of cellular formaldehyde released into the medium increased as SH-SY5Y and BV2 cells were incubated for three days. Formaldehyde in excess impaired the processes of N2a cells and neurites of primary cultured rat hippocampal cells. However, removal of formaldehyde markedly rescued and regenerated the processes of N2a cells. These results demonstrated a negative correlation between the endogenous formaldehyde and general cognitive abilities. High formaldehyde levels could be a risk factor for cognitive impairment in older adults, and could be developed as a non-invasive marker for detection and monitoring of age-related cognitive impairment."

The aim of our study was to test the componential structure of the GPT on an archetypal model of motor impairment, Parkinson's disease (PD). A total of 45 PD patients (33 males, 12 females; age M = 67, range = 49-81; PD duration M = 10, range = 6-20 years; H/Y stage 2, range = 2-3) and 20 age- and education-matched controls (14 males, 6 females; age M = 66, range = 48-80) were included. All participants were investigated using the GPT, Short Falls Efficacy Scale-International, Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Non-Motor Symptom Scale. Patients were followed for 6 months, using fall diaries and monthly phone calls to define PD fallers (falls = 1; n = 27) and PD nonfallers (falls = 0; n = 18). Using structural equation modeling, the GPT predicted performance on the MoCA (p &lt; .001), but not on the FAB (p = .29). In conclusion, analysis of the structure of the GPT provided evidence about important cognitive features, in addition to the motor component of this test in PD. "
"24578463","Validation of Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Discriminant Power of Montreal Cognitive Assessment Subtests in Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer Dementia in Turkish Population.","Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a new cognitive tool developed for screening mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The authors examined validity of MoCA and discriminating power of subtests in a Turkish population comprising of 474 participants (246 healthy controls, 114 subjects with MCI and 114 subjects with dementia). The ANCOVAs showed that age and education had a main effect on MoCA scores. Cut scores were computed according to different education levels. The overall cut-off values for MCI and dementia were found to be lower compared to western studies. MoCA was found to have good internal consistency. The subtests most useful in discriminating MCI from healthy controls were recall, visuospatial and language, while in discriminating dementia from MCI were visuospatial, orientation and attention subtests. The results demonstrated that MoCA is a valid and reliable instrument in screening MCI, and compared with the MMSE, MoCA was proved to have superior sensitivity and specificity in detecting MCI. "
"24577459","Post-stroke cognitive impairment: high prevalence and determining factors in a cohort of mild stroke.","BACKGROUND: Because of the aging population and a rise in the number of stroke survivors, the prevalence of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) is increasing.OBJECTIVE: To identify the factors associated with 3-month PSCI.METHODS: All consecutive stroke patients without pre-stroke dementia, mild cognitive disorders, or severe aphasia hospitalized in the Neurology Department of Dijon, University Hospital, France (November 2010 - February 2012) were included in this prospective cohort study. Demographics, vascular risk factors, and stroke data were collected. A first cognitive evaluation was performed during the hospitalization using the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA). Patients assessable at 3 months were categorized as cognitively impaired if the MMSE score was =26/30 and MOCA &lt;26/30 or if the neuropsychological battery confirmed PSCI when the MMSE and MOCA were discordant. Multivariable logistic models were used to determine factors associated with 3-month PSCI.RESULTS: Among the 280 patients included, 220 were assessable at 3 months. The overall frequency of 3-month PSCI was 47.3%, whereas that of dementia was 7.7%. In multivariable analyses, 3-month PSCI was associated with age, low education level, a history of diabetes mellitus, acute confusion, silent infarcts, and functional handicap at discharge. MMSE and MOCA scores during hospitalization were associated with 3-month PSCI (OR = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.54-0.74; p &lt; 0.0001 and OR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.59-0.76; p &lt; 0.0001, respectively).CONCLUSION: Our study underlines the high frequency of PSCI in a cohort of mild stroke. The early cognitive diagnosis of stroke patients could be useful by helping physicians to identify those at a high risk of developing PSCI."

Based on body mass index (BMI), they were categorized into normal weight (18.5 = BMI&lt;24, n = 67), mild overweight (24 = BMI&lt;26, n = 100), severe overweight (26 = BMI&lt;28, n = 134) and obese (BMI = 28, n = 124) groups. They were examined by overnight polysomnography (PSG). And cognitive functions were assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) questionnaires. MoCA scores, clinical and polysomnographic variables were compared between the groups. And the correlations between MoCA scores and clinical and PSG parameters were further evaluated by stepwise multivariate regression. Two-way analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA) was performed to examine the effects of obesity and OSAHS on MoCA score.RESULTS: The scores of MoCA progressively decreased across the spectrum from mild overweight to obese groups. The highest BMI group (obese group) had the lowest MoCA score (25.45 ± 2.35 vs 26.26 ± 2.01, 26.29 ± 2.60, 26.05 ± 2.51, P = 0.030, 0.010, 0.048). The evaluations of MoCA subdomains further revealed selective reductions. Compare to normal weight group, the score of visuospatial and executive function, memory/delayed recall significant decreased in obese and severe overweight groups (visuospatial and executive function: 4.48 ± 0.63 vs 4.07 ± 0.94, 4.13 ± 1.04, P = 0.022, 0.048; memory/delayed recall: 3.54 ± 0.90 vs 2.77 ± 1.20, 2.87 ± 1.30, P = 0.001, 0.004). Stepwise multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that MoCA scores were correlated significantly with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), BMI, age and years of education. Two-way ANOVA revealed that both obesity and OSAHS had independent effects on MoCA score (P = 0.004). The interactions between the effect of obesity and OSAHS on cognitive score were insignificant. It indicated that the effect of BMI on cognitive function did not change with AHI.CONCLUSIONS: In OSAHS patients, obesity aggravates cognitive impairment independently of AHI. And obesity is one of the most important influencing factors of cognitive function."

A total of 50 patients with PD and 50 healthy controls were included. The screening instruments-MoCA-TR followed by the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE-TR) and MoCA-TR retest within 1 month-and detailed neuropsychological testing were administered to the PD patients. MoCA-TR and MMSE-TR were also administered to controls. The discriminant validities of the MoCA-TR and MMSE-TR as screening and diagnostic instruments were ascertained. The concurrent and criterion validity, test-retest reliability, and internal consistency of the MoCA-TR and MMSE-TR were examined. The Cronbach's alpha of the MoCA-TR as an index of internal consistency was 0.664, and the test-retest reliability of MoCA-TR was 0.742. With a cut-off score of &lt; 21 points, the MoCA-TR showed sensitivity of 59% and specificity of 89% in the detection of cognitive dysfunction in PD. The area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (95% confidence interval) for MoCA-TR was 0.794 (0.670-0.918), p&lt;.001. The present results indicated that the MoCA-TR has acceptable psychometric properties and it should be used to assess mild cognitive impairment and early dementia in PD patients, whereas the MMSE-TR should remain the instrument of choice to assess cognitive impairment in PD dementia."
"24498389","Abnormal intrinsic brain activity patterns in patients with subcortical ischemic vascular dementia.","OBJECTIVES: To investigate the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) alteration of whole brain in patients with subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with SIVD and 35 control subjects were included in this study. All of them underwent structural MRI and rs-fMRI scan. The structural data were processed using the voxel-based morphometry 8 toolbox (VBM8). The rs-fMRI data were processed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) and Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF) software. Within-group analysis was performed with a one-sample Student's t-test to identify brain regions with ALFF value larger than the mean. Intergroup analysis was performed with a two-sample Student's t-test to identify ALFF differences of whole brain between SIVD and control subjects. Partial correlations between ALFF values and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were analyzed in the SIVD group across the parameters of age, gender, years of education, and GM volume.RESULTS: Within-group analysis showed that the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), inferior parietal lobe (IPL), occipital lobe, and adjacent precuneus had significantly higher standardized ALFF values than the global mean ALFF value in both groups. Compared to the controls, patients with SIVD presented lower ALFF values in the bilateral precuneus and higher ALFF values in the bilateral ACC, left insula and hippocampus. Including GM volume as an extra covariate, the ALFF inter-group difference exhibited highly similar spatial patterns to those without GM volume correcting. Close negative correlations were found between the ALFF values of left insula and the MoCA and MMSE scores of SIVD patients.CONCLUSION: SIVD is associated with a unique spontaneous aberrant activity of rs-fMRI signals, and measurement of ALFF in the precuneus, ACC, insula, and hippocampus may aid in the detection of SIVD."

The English MoCA was translated into Cantonese Chinese and then back-translated. We then evaluated the content validity, reliability, sensitivity and specificity of the Chinese Cantonese MoCA.RESULTS: We recruited 115 cognitively normal controls, 87 aMCI and 64 AD patients. Only education was positively correlated with the Cantonese MoCA score (r = 0.46, P &lt; 0.001). The Chinese Cantonese MoCA had a high internal consistency with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.85. In the test-retest reliability assessment, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.95 (P &lt; 0.001). The ICC for the interrater reliability was 0.96 (P &lt; 0.001). Receiving operating characteristic curve analyses showed an area under the curve of 0.85 and 0.99 for aMCI and AD, respectively (both P &lt; 0.001). The optimal cut-off score for detection of aMCI was 22/23, which yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 78% and 73%, respectively. The optimal cut-off score for detection of AD was 19/20, which gave sensitivity and specificity of 94% and 92%, respectively.CONCLUSION: The Cantonese Chinese MoCA is a consistent and reliable instrument. In terms of its validity, the MoCA is better in the detection of AD than aMCI in Cantonese-speaking Chinese persons. It is only fair for the screening of aMCI."
"24443573","[Hungarian version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) for screening mild cognitive impairment].","Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be considered as an intermediate stage between normal cognitive aging and dementia. Its screening is extremely important because within a year in 15-20% of cases dementia can evolve. In Hungary, the most widely used screening tool for both dementia and MCI is the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), which is often criticized for its poor screening sensitivity of mild dementia and MCI. To eliminate this problem, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was developed, especially for screening MCI. Our study presents the first results with the Hungarian translation of MoCA. We used Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) for controlling depression. In MoCA the cutoff score between healthy and MCI persons was 24 out of 30. MoCA was more sensitive in detecting MCI than MMSE and its inner consistency was also slightly higher. Specificity of the tests to detect MCI was similar. The results on BDI were not related to either MoCA or MMSE. Our results suggest that MoCA can be a useful tool to detect cognitive decline. "

All patients were investigated through a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, laboratory tests essential to exclude a reversible form of dementia, imaging studies (CT or MRI and SPECT or FDG-PET), Apolipoprotein E allele genotyping and CSF biomarker (Aß42,Tau, and P-tau) analyses. The clinical diagnosis was established through the consensus of a multidisciplinary team, based on international criteria. The results demonstrated an overall good fit of both items and the person's values, a high variability on cognitive performance level, and a good quality of the measurements. The MoCA scores also demonstrated adequate discriminant validity, with high diagnostic value. DIF analyses indicated the generalized validity of the MoCA scores. In conclusion, the results of this study show the overall psychometric adequacy of the MoCA and verify the discriminant and generalized validity of the obtained results. "
"24395708","Predictors of cognitive impairment in an early stage Parkinson's disease cohort.","The impact of Parkinson's disease (PD) dementia is substantial and has major functional and socioeconomic consequences. Early prediction of future cognitive impairment would help target future interventions. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and fluency tests were administered to 486 patients with PD within 3.5 years of diagnosis, and the results were compared with those from 141 controls correcting for age, sex, and educational years. Eighteen-month longitudinal assessments were performed in 155 patients with PD. The proportion of patients classified with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia varied considerably, depending on the MoCA and MMSE thresholds used. With the MoCA total score at screening threshold, 47.7%, 40.5%, and 11.7% of patients with PD were classified with normal cognition, MCI, and dementia, respectively; by comparison, 78.7% and 21.3% of controls had normal cognition and MCI, respectively. Cognitive impairment was predicted by lower education, increased age, male sex, and quantitative motor and non-motor (smell, depression, and anxiety) measures. Longitudinal data from 155 patients with PD over 18 months showed significant reductions in MoCA scores, but not in MMSE scores, with 21.3% of patients moving from normal cognition to MCI and 4.5% moving from MCI to dementia, although 13.5% moved from MCI to normal; however, none of the patients with dementia changed their classification. The MoCA may be more sensitive than the MMSE in detecting early baseline and longitudinal cognitive impairment in PD, because it identified 25.8% of those who experienced significant cognitive decline over 18 months. Cognitive decline was associated with worse motor and non-motor features, suggesting that this reflects a faster progressive phenotype."
"24390367","High prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder in HIV-infected patients with a baseline CD4 count = 350 cells/µL in Shanghai, China.","This study sought to determine the prevalence and risk factors of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) in HIV-infected patients with a baseline CD4 count = 350 cells/µL in Shanghai, China. Subjects were 309 HIV-infected patients with a baseline CD4 count = 350 cells/µL. General demographic and clinical information were collected by patient interview. Patients' cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), combined with a questionnaire on cognitive complaints. The median age of patients was 34 years (IQR: 28-43.5). In terms of sex, 272 (88.0%) of the patients were male. Of the patients, 236 (76.4%) had been on antiretroviral treatment (ART) (for a median duration of 14 months, IQR: 1-29 months) before the study. Of the patients, 183 (59.2%) mentioned having a cognitive disorder. MoCA screening revealed that the prevalence of HAND was 48.2% and that HAND was more prevalent in patients with cognitive complaints (53.0%) than in patients with no such complaints (41.3%) (p = 0.042). Multivariate analysis indicated that HAND was associated with being female (p = 0.006), being older (p &lt; 0.001), having a lower level of education (p &lt; 0.001), and longer use of efavirenz in an ART regimen (p = 0.040). This study found that HAND frequently developed in HIV-infected patients with a baseline CD4 count = 350 cells/µL in Shanghai, China. Being older, being female, having a low level of education, and receiving efavirenz treatment for a longer period may be associated with a greater risk of developing HAND. This study suggests that HAND should be routinely screened for in all newly diagnosed HIV-positive patients, and especially in those with the aforementioned risk factors for developing HAND. "

(2) In the OSAHS patients, with similar age and education background and BMI, there were positive correlations between scores on MoCA and SaO2mean (r=0.283, P=0.054), scores on SCWT and Sat90 (r=0.277, P=0.059); but there were negative correlations between scores on MoCA and TSat90 (r=-0.353, P=0.015), visual reproduction (r=-0.308, P=0.035), logical memory (r=-0.306, P=0.036), digit span forward (r=-0.297, P=0.043), backward (r=-0.322, P=0.027) and Sat90.CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that male patients with severe OSAHS had widespread executive dysfunctions (shifting, inhibition, updating) and memory impairments. Nighttime hypoxia and sleep fragmentation were closely related to the cognitive impairments of OSAHS."

MoCA-B scores did not differ significantly according to literacy, and multiple regression suggested no association with age or education. The optimal cutoff score of 24 out of 25 yielded 81% sensitivity and 86% specificity for MCI (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.90, P &lt; .001). Test-retest reliability was 0.91 (P &lt; .001), and internal consistency was 0.82. Administration time was 15 to 21 minutes.CONCLUSION: The MoCA-B appears to have excellent validity and addresses an unmet need by accurately screening for MCI in poorly educated older adults regardless of literacy."

"26635008","Montreal Cognitive Assessment Performance in HIV/AIDS: Impact of Systemic Factors.","BACKGROUND: A large proportion of people living with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) suffer from neurocognitive impairment (NCI). The causes of the NCI are multifold in HIV infection although a subset of HIV/AIDS patients are affected by the spectrum syndrome, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). We investigated the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in relation to clinical, demographic and laboratory findings as well as its ability to predict symptomatic HAND (sHAND) among patients with HIV/AIDS.METHODS: All subjects were receiving regular HIV care including CD4+ T cell counts, plasma viral load measurements, clinical evaluations and antiretroviral therapy. The diagnosis of sHAND was based upon clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological assessments.RESULTS: Among HIV-1 seropositive subjects (n=125), ethnicity, education and employment were positively correlated with their MoCA scores (p&lt;0.05). In contrast, polypharmacy, central nervous system penetration-effectiveness (CPE) score, antiretroviral drug exposure, substance use and nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor side effects were negatively correlated with MoCA scores (p&lt;0.05). Of note, MoCA scores were not associated with CD4 T cell nadir levels, age, peak viral load, or veterans aging cohort study index. In subjects with or without sHAND, mean MoCA scores differed (sHAND, 22.8±3.51; non-HAND 25.2±2.64) (p&lt;0.05) with a receiver operating characteristic curve showing an area under curve of 0.71 and an optimal MoCA cut-off value of 23.5 when compared to the established diagnostic paradigm.CONCLUSIONS: MoCA scores were generally lower in this HIV/AIDS population compared to reported scores in the general population. MoCA performance was associated with multiple clinical variables but displayed limited predictive utility in detecting sHAND."

"26620850","A subtest analysis of the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA): which subtests can best discriminate between healthy controls, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease?","BACKGROUND: It is necessary to continue to explore the psychometric characteristics of key cognitive screening tests such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to diagnose cognitive decline as early as possible and to attend to the growing need of clinical trials involving mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants. The main aim of this study was to assess which MoCA subtests could best discriminate between healthy controls (HC), participants with MCI, and Alzheimer's disease (AD).METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of 136 elderly with more than four years of education. All participants were submitted to detailed clinical, laboratory, and neuroimaging evaluation. The MoCA, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) were applied to all participants. The MoCA test was not used in the diagnostic procedure.RESULTS: Median MoCA total scores were 27, 23 and 18 for HC, MCI, and AD, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Word repetition, inverse digits, serial 7, phrases, verbal fluency, abstraction, and word recall discriminated between MCI and HC participants (p &lt; 0.001). The clock drawing, the rhino naming, delayed recall of five words and orientation discriminated between patients with MCI and AD (p &lt; 0.001). A reduced version of the MoCA with only these items did not improve accuracy between MCI and HC (p = 0.076) or MCI and AD (p = 0.119).CONCLUSIONS: Not all MoCA subtests might be fundamental to clinical diagnosis of MCI. The reduced versions of MoCA did not add diagnostic accuracy."
"26618003","Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Modified Mini Mental State Examination in African Americans.","Background. Sparse data limit the interpretation of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores, particularly in minority populations. Additionally, there are no published data on how MoCA scores compare to the widely used Modified Mini Mental State Examination (3MSE). We provide performance data on the MoCA in a large cohort of African Americans and compare 3MSE and MoCA scores, providing a &quot;crosswalk&quot; for interpreting scores. Methods. Five hundred and thirty African Americans with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in African American-Diabetes Heart Study-MIND, a cross-sectional study of cognition and structural and functional brain imaging. After excluding participants with possible cognitive impairment (n = 115), mean (SD) MoCA and 3MSE scores are presented stratified by age and education. Results. Participant mean age was 58.2 years (range: 35-83); 61% were female; and 64.9% had &gt;12 years of education. Mean (SD) 3MSE and MoCA scores were 86.9 (8.2) and 19.8 (3.8), respectively. 93.5% of the cohort had a &quot;positive&quot; screen on the MoCA, scoring &lt;26 (education-adjusted), compared with 47.5% on the 3MSE (cut-point &lt; 88). A 3MSE score of 88 corresponded to a MoCA score of 20 in this population. Conclusion. The present data suggest the need for caution when applying proposed MoCA cutoffs to African Americans. "

Data of biochemical parameters and biomarkers were collected.RESULTS: Serum AGEs, RAGE, and CRP levels were significantly increased in MCI patients compared to controls. In group of patients with MCI, serum RAGE level was positively correlated with AGEs level and with CRP level. RAGE, AGEs, and CRP concentrations were positively correlated with HbA1c levels and negatively correlated with MoCA score. The univariate logistic regression models revealed that variables, which increased the likelihood of diagnosis of MCI in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes were higher levels of HbA1c, RAGE, AGEs, CRP, TG, lower level of HDL cholesterol, previous CVD, HA, or use of HA drugs, hyperlipidemia, retinopathy, nephropathy, increased number of co-morbidities, older age, and less years of formal education. HA or use of HA drugs, previous CVD, higher level of RAGE and CRP, older age and less years of formal education are the factors increasing the likelihood of having MCI in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes in multivariable model.CONCLUSION: In summary, serum AGEs, RAGE, and CRP are increased in the circulation of MCI elderly diabetic patients compared to controls. A larger population-based prospective study needs to be performed to further confirm the relationship between AGEs, RAGE, and the cognitive decline or progress to dementia."

"26530222","Relationship between glycated hemoglobin A1c and cognitive function in nondemented elderly patients with type 2 diabetes.","Elderly patients with type 2 diabetes are at a greater risk for cognitive decline. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between the degree of hyperglycemia and cognitive status in nondemented, elderly diabetics. Between Jan 2013 and Dec 2014, 1174 geriatric patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in the study (579 males; age = 60 years; from Fuzhou, Fujian, China). Cognitive function was measured with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). A statistically significant, age-adjusted association was observed between the A1C levels and the scores on two cognitive tests (MMSE and MoCA). Specifically, a 1% higher A1C value was associated with a 0.21-point lower MMSE score (95% CI; compare -0.11 to -0.28; P &lt; 0.0001), as well as a 0.11-point lower MoCA score (95% CI; compare -0.10 to -0.38; P &lt; 0.0001). Higher A1C levels were not significantly associated with lower MMSE and MoCA test scores after adjusting for all variables. No significant correlation was found between the two variables in patients older than 80 years of age (n = 215; OR = 1.019; 95% CI = 0.968 - 1.099; p = 0.251). Evidence strongly suggests that chronic hyperglycemia is associated with a decline in cognitive function in nondemented elderly patients with type 2 diabetes. When cognitive assessments are made, comprehensive factors such as advanced age, education level, duration of diabetes, hypertension and other vascular risks should be taken into account. For older geriatric patients (age = 80 years), there is no significant correlation between A1c levels and cognitive function."
"26503441","A correlativity study of plasma APL1ß28 and clusterin levels with MMSE/MoCA/CASI in aMCI patients.","Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a sub-clinical condition characterized by memory deficits that are not severe enough to affect daily functioning. Here we investigated two potential biomarkers found in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients, APLP1-derived Aß-like peptides 28 (APL1ß28) and clusterin plasma levels, in terms of their relationship to cognitive function, as reflected in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Cognitive Assessment Screening Instrument (CASI) in aMCI patients. Forty-seven aMCI patients and thirty-five age- and gender-matched healthy adult controls were recruited for this study. Using the ELISA method, we found that the mean concentrations of both APL1ß28 and clusterin were not significantly different between the control and aMCI groups. The APL1ß28 levels were positively correlated with clusterin and that both were negatively correlated with the MMSE scores of the aMCI patients. Clusterin levels were negatively correlated with the MoCA and CASI scores of the aMCI patients. Using multivariate analysis, the correlation between clusterin and MMSE/MoCA/CASI was independent of other AD risk factors including age, education, sex, body mass index and ApoE genotype. The data presented here demonstrate that plasma clusterin levels reflect cognitive function in aMCI patients. "

Questionnaires were completed after initial brain radiotherapy consultation and 1-2 weeks later. Patients completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Descriptive statistics are reported. Fifty-three patients participated, median age 62 years, ECOG status 0-2 (90 %), with 75 % having secondary brain metastasis. 21/53 (40 %) patients reported needing help reading medical information. Only 28 % patients had normal cognition (MoCA score = 26/30). Initially, 82 % of patients and 87 % of caregivers reported the consultation was 'extremely/quite clear, and 69 % of their health professionals thought consultation 'extremely/quite clear' to patient. At follow-up, fewer patients (75 %) reported health professionals' explanation as 'extremely/quite clear'. Although patients recalled discussed illness and treatment details, 82 % recalled treatment-related side effects and management thereof by 46 %. CST use was reported by 22 % patients, 19 % caregivers, and 27 %health professionals. When used, tools improved understanding according to 92 % patients, 100 % caregivers, and 91 % health professionals. The majority of patients have some level of cognitive impairment.

"26491279","Assessment of cognitive impairment in long-term oxygen therapy-dependent COPD patients.","BACKGROUND: A number of studies have shown that COPD, particularly in its later and more severe stages, is associated with various cognitive deficits. Thus, the primary goal of the present study was to elucidate the extent of cognitive impairment in patients with long-term oxygen therapy-dependent (LTOTD) COPD. In addition, this study aimed to determine the effectiveness of two cognitive screening tests, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), for COPD patients and the ability of oxygen therapy to mitigate COPD-related deficits in cognitive function.METHODS: The present study enrolled 45 subjects: 24 nonuser and 21 regular-user LTOTD-COPD patients. All subjects had a similar grade of education, and there were no significant differences regarding age or sex. The MoCA (cutoff: &lt;26 points) and MMSE (cutoff: =24 points) scores were compared between these two groups.RESULTS: The nonuser LTOTD-COPD group had a significantly lower MoCA score than that of the regular-user LTOTD-COPD group (19.38±2.99 vs 21.68±2.14, respectively) as well as a significantly lower MMSE score. Moreover, the absence of supplemental oxygen therapy increased the risk of cognitive impairment (MoCA, P=0.007 and MMSE, P=0.014), and the MoCA and MMSE scores significantly correlated with the number of emergency admissions and the number of hospitalizations in the last year.CONCLUSION: In the present study, the nonuser LTOTD-COPD group exhibited a significant decrease in cognitive status compared with the regular-user LTOTD-COPD group. This suggests that the assessment of cognitive function in nonuser LTOTD-COPD patients and the use of protective strategies, such as continuous supplemental oxygen treatment, should be considered during the management of COPD in this population. In addition, the MoCA score was superior to the MMSE score for the determination of cognitive impairment in the nonuser LTOTD-COPD patients."
"26484925","Sensitivity of Neuropsychological Tests to Identify Cognitive Decline in Highly Educated Elderly Individuals: 12 Months Follow up.","Highly educated individuals have a lower risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). A common assumption is that their &quot;cognitive reserve&quot; protects them from cognitive decline and postpones the clinical manifestation of dementia. These highly educated individuals usually obtain normal scores on cognitive screening tests, although at the same time they can experience subjective cognitive decline and difficulty in multiple cognitive domains. Although comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations usually identify subtle changes in cognition, they demand extensive resources and thus are expensive and difficult to obtain. Therefore, lack of sensitivity of screening tests on the one hand, along with difficulty to acquire a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation on the other hand, impede identification of cognitive decline at its earliest stages in this special population. Accordingly, this study aims to identify which neuropsychological tests have the highest sensitivity to detect the earliest stages of cognitive decline among highly educated elderly [n<U+200A>=<U+200A>27, ages 66-80 (mean<U+200A>=<U+200A>72.6 SD<U+200A>=<U+200A>4.54), mean education level<U+200A>=<U+200A>17.14 (SD<U+200A>=<U+200A>3.21 range: 12-24 years)]. Baseline scores and scores at one-year follow up were obtained. We also conducted MRI scans to characterize the relation between brain volume and cognitive performance. Results show significant reductions in RVALT, Semantic verbal Fluency, ROCF copy, and MoCA scores whereas PF, TMT, ROCF delay, digit span, and knowledge tests were not significant. The study stresses the importance of using sensitive neuropsychological tests to examine this special population and the need to create norms that combine an individual's education with age. "
"26470772","Montreal Cognitive Assessment: One Cutoff Never Fits All.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to examine the discrepancy between single versus age and education corrected cutoff scores in classifying performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack.METHODS: MoCA norms were collected from 794 functionally independent and stroke- and dementia-free persons aged =65 years. magnetic resonance imaging was used to exclude healthy controls with significant brain pathology and medial temporal lobe atrophy. Cutoff scores at 16th, 7th, and 2nd percentiles by age and education were derived for the MoCA and MoCA 5-minute Protocol. MoCA performance in 919 patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack was classified using the single and norm-derived cutoff scores.RESULTS: The norms for the Hong Kong version of the MoCA total and domain scores and the total score of the MoCA 5-minute protocol are described. Only 65.1% and 25.7% healthy controls and 45.2% and 19.0% patients scored above the conventional cutoff scores of 21/22 and 25/26 on the MoCA. Using classification with norm-derived cutoff scores as reference, locally derived cutoff score of 21/22 yielded a classification discrepancy of =42.4%. Discrepancy increased with higher age and lower education level, with the majority being false positives by single cutoffs. With the 25/26 cutoff of the original MoCA, discrepancy further increased to =74.3%.CONCLUSIONS: Conventional single cutoff scores are associated with substantially high rates of misclassification especially in older and less-educated patients with stroke. These results caution against the use of one-size-fits-all cutoffs on the MoCA."
"26459220","Exploring the effects of coexisting amyloid in subcortical vascular cognitive impairment.","BACKGROUND: Mixed pathology, particularly Alzheimer's disease with cerebrovascular lesions, is reported as the second most common cause of dementia. Research on mixed dementia typically includes people with a primary AD diagnosis and hence, little is known about the effects of co-existing amyloid pathology in people with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). The purpose of this study was to understand whether individual differences in amyloid pathology might explain variations in cognitive impairment among individuals with clinical subcortical VCI (SVCI).METHODS: Twenty-two participants with SVCI completed an (11)C Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) position emission tomography (PET) scan to quantify global amyloid deposition. Cognitive function was measured using: 1) MOCA; 2) ADAS-Cog; 3) EXIT-25; and 4) specific executive processes including a) Digits Forward and Backwards Test, b) Stroop-Colour Word Test, and c) Trail Making Test. To assess the effect of amyloid deposition on cognitive function we conducted Pearson bivariate correlations to determine which cognitive measures to include in our regression models. Cognitive variables that were significantly correlated with PIB retention values were entered in a hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis to determine the unique effect of amyloid on cognitive function. We controlled for age, education, and ApoE e4 status.RESULTS: Bivariate correlation results showed that PIB binding was significantly correlated with ADAS-Cog (p &lt; 0.01) and MOCA (p &lt; 0.01); increased PIB binding was associated with worse cognitive function on both cognitive measures. PIB binding was not significantly correlated with the EXIT-25 or with specific executive processes (p &gt; 0.05). Regression analyses controlling for age, education, and ApoE e4 status indicated an independent association between PIB retention and the ADAS-Cog (adjusted R-square change of 15.0%, Sig F Change = 0.03). PIB retention was also independently associated with MOCA scores (adjusted R-Square Change of 27.0%, Sig F Change = 0.02).CONCLUSION: We found that increased global amyloid deposition was significantly associated with greater memory and executive dysfunctions as measured by the ADAS-Cog and MOCA. Our findings point to the important role of co-existing amyloid deposition for cognitive function in those with a primary SVCI diagnosis. As such, therapeutic approaches targeting SVCI must consider the potential role of amyloid for the optimal care of those with mixed dementia.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01027858."

Gender and education correlated positively and significantly with the score; however age proved negatively significant.CONCLUSION: The prevalence of cognitive impairment featured highly in preoperative geriatric patients. The gender age, and education but not preoperative drugs used affected cognitive function."
"26401443","APOE genotype and age modifies the correlation between cognitive status and metabolites from hippocampus by a 2D (1)H-MRS in non-demented elders.","Purpose. To examine the associations among age, Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, metabolic changes in the hippocampus detected by 2D (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and neuropsychological measures of cognition in non-demented elders. Materials and Methods. We studied a cohort of 16 cognitively normal controls (CN) and 11 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients between 66 and 88 years old who were genotyped for APOE genetic polymorphism. Measurements of 2D(1)H-MRS metabolites were obtained in the hippocampus region. Adjusting by age among all subjects, the association between metabolic changes and cognitive function was measured by Spearman partial rank-order correlation. The effect of APOE status was measured by separating the subjects into APOE genotype subgroups, including the APOEe4 carriers and APOEe4 non-carriers. Results. In contrast to the CN group matched with age, gender, and education, aMCI patients showed increased myo-inositol (mI)/Creatine (Cr) ratio only in the right hippocampus. No differences were noted on N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/Cr and mI/NAA from bilateral hippocampus, and so was mI/Cr ratio in left hippocampus between aMCI and CN. The mI/Cr ratio from the right hippocampus in non-demented elders was negatively correlated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores. Whether e4 genotype or age was added as a covariate, none of the correlation effects remained significant. Additionally, adjusting for age and APOE genotype together, there was no significant correlation between them. Conclusion. Since the higher mI/Cr from the right hippocampus of the patients with aMCI than those from CN, the mI/Cr could be a more specific predictor of general cognitive function in aMCI patients. There is an association between higher mI/Cr in right hippocampus and worse cognitive function for the non-demented older adults, and the correlation could be modified by APOE status and age. That provided a window on objectively understanding the mechanism between the brain metabolites and the influence factors in non-demented elders. "
"26392762","Cognitive function and living situation in COPD: is there a relationship with self-management and quality of life?","BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is increasingly being found to be a common comorbidity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study sought to understand the relationship of comprehensively measured cognitive function with COPD severity, quality of life, living situation, health care utilization, and self-management abilities.METHODS: Subjects with COPD were recruited from the outpatient pulmonary clinic. Cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA). Self-management abilities were measured using the Self Management Ability Score 30. Quality of life was measured using the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire. Pearson correlation was used to assess the bivariate association of the MOCA with other study measures. Multivariate analysis was completed to understand the interaction of the MOCA and living situation on COPD outcomes of hospitalization, quality of life, and self-management ability.RESULTS: This study included 100 participants of mean age 70±9.4 years (63% male, 37% female) with COPD (mean FEV1 [forced expiratory volume in 1 second] percentage predicted 40.4±16.7). Mean MOCA score was 23.8±3.9 with 63% of patients having mild cognitive impairment. The MOCA was negatively correlated with age (r=-0.28, P=0.005) and positively correlated with education (r=+0.24, P=0.012). There was no significant correlation between cognitive function and exacerbations, emergency room (ER) visits, or hospitalizations. There was no association between the MOCA score and self-management abilities or quality of life. We tested the interaction of living situation and the MOCA with self-management abilities and found statistical significance (P=0.017), indicating that individuals living alone with higher cognitive function report lower self-management abilities.CONCLUSION: Cognitive impairment in COPD does not appear to be meaningfully associated with COPD severity, health outcomes, or self-management abilities. The routine screening for cognitive impairment due to a diagnosis of COPD may not be indicated. Living alone significantly affects the interaction between self-management abilities and cognitive function."
"26338988","Resilience and MRI correlates of cognitive impairment in community-dwelling elders.","BACKGROUND: The contribution of education and intelligence to resilience against age-related cognitive decline is not clear, particularly in the presence of 'normal for age' minor brain abnormalities.METHOD: Participants (n = 208, mean age 69.2 years, s.d. = 5.4) in the Whitehall II imaging substudy attended for neuropsychological testing and multisequence 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging. Images were independently rated by three trained clinicians for global and hippocampal atrophy, periventricular and deep white matter changes.RESULTS: Although none of the participants qualified for a clinical diagnosis of dementia, a screen for cognitive impairment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) &lt;26) was abnormal in 22%. Hippocampal atrophy, in contrast to other brain measures, was associated with a reduced MoCA score even after controlling for age, gender, socioeconomic status, years of education and premorbid IQ. Premorbid IQ and socioeconomic status were associated with resilience in the presence of hippocampal atrophy.CONCLUSIONS: Independent contributions from a priori risk (age, hippocampal atrophy) and resilience (premorbid function, socioeconomic status) combine to predict measured cognitive impairment."
"26313522","One-Year Change in the Japanese Version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Performance and Related Predictors in Community-Dwelling Older Adults.","OBJECTIVES: To examine the distribution and associated predictors of 1-year changes in the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J) in community-dwelling older adults.DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.SETTING: Population-based cohort study in Tokyo, Japan.PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 65 to 84 (N = 496).MEASUREMENTS: Multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the odds of experiencing subsequent improvement in MoCA-J performance, as opposed to stable or deteriorating, while simultaneously adjusting for baseline MoCA-J score and major confounders.RESULTS: Mean age was 74.0 ± 4.8; mean MoCA-J score was 23.7 ± 3.6. Only 40% had stable MoCA-J performance; 30% experienced deterioration and 30% improvement. Age increment, hospitalization in previous year, slower Timed Up and Go (TUG) score, and slower maximum walking speed were predictive of subsequent MoCA-J performance deterioration.CONCLUSION: Slower TUG and walking speed performances were independent predictors of short-term MoCA-J deterioration. Research aimed at assessing lower-extremity performance-based tests in MCI-related decision-making is warranted."
"26132488","Relationship between dual task walking, cognition, and depression in oldest old people.","BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to investigate the relationship between dual task walking, cognition, and depression in oldest old people living in the community.METHODS: We conducted an observational cross-sectional study at Federal University of São Carlos (Brazil). We assessed 67 community-dwelling older adults aged 80 years and over, who were able to walk alone and did not present with a risk of dementia (assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE). The assessment consisted of anamnesis, dual task using the Timed Up and Go test associated with a motor task (TUGT-motor) and a cognitive task (TUGT-cognitive); cognitive measures using MMSE, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Clock Drawing test (CDT) and verbal fluency, and depressive measures by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).RESULTS: There was a correlation with higher magnitude between cognitive tests and TUGT-cognitive, compared to TUGT-motor. For TUGT-motor, the highest correlations with cognitive tests were found between time and MMSE, MoCA (total score), and MoCA visuospatial/executive domain. For TUGT-cognitive, the highest correlations with cognitive tests were between number of steps and MMSE and between time and MMSE. GDS showed a significant weak correlation with number of steps taken in TUGT-motor, wrong words, and correct/time of TUGT-cognitive.CONCLUSIONS: Dual task performances are associated with cognition in oldest old. Furthermore, dual task tests have less influence of educational level, are functional, fast, and easily applicable in clinical practice. Future studies are needed to confirm if dual task test is useful for cognitive screening in oldest old."
"26099337","Cognitive impairment in relation to depression, anxiety and virological response in hepatitis C patients in Egypt.","OBJECTIVE: Cognitive impairment commonly occurs in hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence and sociodemographic and clinical correlates of cognitive impairment in HCV patients before and after 12 weeks of interferon treatment in comparison with a control group.METHODS: Hundred and sixteen consecutive HCV patients were included in the study and divided into treated and untreated groups. All patients were assessed using sociodemographic and clinical questionnaire, Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MOCA) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) before and after 12 weeks of treatment or observation.RESULTS: Thirty-eight percent of treated patients showed cognitive impairment at baseline, which increased to 69% after 12 weeks of interferon treatment. This cognitive impairment was reflected in the total MOCA score and in visuo-constructional skills, attention, concentration, working memory, language, and short-term memory, which was not shown by untreated group after 12 weeks of observation. Cognitive impairment was associated with low education, but not with depression, anxiety, or virological response.CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairment is common in HCV patients and increases significantly after interferon treatment. It is not related to depression or anxiety in HCV patients. Future research should focus on prevention, treatment and outcome of cognitive impairment in HCV patients, particularly those receiving interferon therapy."
"26067432","Effect of Carotid Artery Stenting on Cognitive Function in Patients with Internal Carotid Artery Stenosis and Cerebral Lacunar Infarction: A 3-Year Follow-Up Study in China.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is an important therapeutic strategy for patients with carotid artery stenosis. However, the potential influence of CAS on cognitive function in patients with carotid artery stenosis and cerebral lacunar infarction has not been determined. This study investigated changes in cognitive function associated with CAS and the factors related to these changes.METHODS: This prospective cohort study comprised 579 Chinese patients with cerebral lacunar infarction and carotid artery stenosis for whom CAS was indicated, and a matched control group of 552 healthy individuals. Cognitive function before CAS and at scheduled intervals from 6 months to 3 years was assessed with instruments that included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale. Potential factors that might affect cognitive function were analyzed via logistic regression.RESULTS: The MMSE and MoCA scores of the patients before CAS were significantly lower than that of the control subjects. These scores were significantly higher 6 months after CAS and sustained or increased throughout the 3-year follow-up. Also significantly improved after CAS from baseline were scores for an alternating trail test, cube copying, clock-drawing, attention, and delayed recall in an auditory-verbal learning test. Logistic regression analyses showed that age greater than 65 y, little education, diabetes, and hypertension were independent risk factors for deteriorated MoCA scores 3 years after CAS.CONCLUSION: CAS was associated with significantly improved cognitive function in cerebral lacunar infarction patients with severe stenosis."
"26001202","Cognitive profile of Parkinson's disease patients: a comparative study between early-onset and late-onset Parkinson's disease.","AIM: To investigate the influence of onset age on the occurrence and progression of cognitive dysfunction using neuropsychological tests and the electrophysiological component P300 in both early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) and late-onset Parkinson's disease (LOPD) patients.METHODS: A cohort of 76 EOPD patients and 166 LOPD patients was recruited for this study. Demographic information and clinical features, including age, disease duration, education level, family history, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, the Hoehn and Yahr stage, and depression scores were documented for each patient. The Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Revised, Chinese version (WAIS-RC) and Wechsler Memory Scale - Revised, Chinese version (WMS-RC) were used. In addition, P300 was also examined to assess cognitive function.RESULTS: Although EOPD patients had longer disease duration, their cognitive dysfunction progressed more slowly. The MoCA tests revealed that EOPD patients had higher scores in visuospatial function, attention, delayed recall, and orientation than the LOPD patients. The difference between the two groups on the WMS-RC test did not reach significance, whereas the scores in executive function, visuospatial function and attention as measured on the WAIS-RC test were significantly lower in the LOPD group. In addition, P300 latencies were markedly delayed and P300 amplitudes were reduced in the LOPD group.CONCLUSIONS: The current findings demonstrated that cognitive dysfunction progressed more slowly in the EOPD group. Although the LOPD patients exhibited shorter disease durations, their cognitive abilities, including executive function, visuospatial function and attention, may have been impaired."
"25993629","The relationship between dual-task and cognitive performance among elderly participants who exercise regularly.","BACKGROUND: The dual-task performance is associated with the functionality of the elderly and it becomes more complex with age.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the Timed Up and Go dual task (TUG-DT) and cognitive tests among elderly participants who exercise regularly.METHOD: This study examined 98 non-institutionalized people over 60 years old who exercised regularly. Participants were assessed using the TUG-DT (i.e. doing the TUG while listing the days of the week in reverse order), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Clock Drawing Test (CDT), and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). The motor (i.e. time and number of steps) and cognitive (i.e. number of correct words) data were collected from TUG-DT. We used a significance level of a=0.05 and SPSS 17.0 for all data analyses.RESULTS: This current elderly sample featured a predominance of women (69.4%) who were highly educated (median=10 years of education) compared to Brazilian population and mostly non-fallers (86.7%). The volunteers showed a good performance on the TUG-DT and the other cognitive tests, except the MoCA, with scores below the cutoff of 26 points. Significant and weak correlations were observed between the TUG-DT (time) and the visuo-spatial/executive domain of the MoCA and the MMSE. The cognitive component of the TUG-DT showed strong correlations between the total MoCA performance score and its visuo-spatial/executive domain.CONCLUSIONS: The use of the TUG-DT to assess cognition is promising; however, the use of more challenging cognitive tasks should be considered when the study population has a high level of education."
"25958706","The factors associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in surgical menopause women.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: As a sizeable proportion of persons with mild cognitive impairment will progress to frank dementia, early detection is an important strategy to prevent and decelerate the progression of cognitive decline. In Thailand, the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment in surgical menopause women has not been well established. The objectives of the present study were to determine the percentage and factors associated with mild cognitive impairment in women with surgical menopause.MATERIAL AND METHOD: Between October 2013 and July 2014, 200 eligible women at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital were enrolled. The self-reported questionnaires were used to obtain the demographic data and the Thai version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The MCI was diagnosed when the MoCA score was less than 25. The data were statistically analyzed using SPSS version 17 for student t-test, Chi-square test, and multiple regression analysis.RESULTS: The percentage of MCI in the present study was 43.5%. The univariate analysis showed that factors significantly related to MCI were marital status, educational levels, occupation, monthly income, and duration of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Nevertheless, multiple regression analysis revealed that only older age at enrollment, marital status, low educational level, and low monthly income were significantly related to MCI.CONCLUSION: Almost half of the surgical menopause women in the present study had MCI. Older age at enrollment, marital status, low educational level, and low monthly income were significantly related to MCI. Age at surgical menopause and HRT were not found to be associated with MCI in this study."
"25944337","Scaling Cognitive Domains of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment: An Analysis Using the Partial Credit Model.","The psychometric properties of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were examined by using the Partial Credit Model. The study sample included 897 participants who were distributed into two main subgroups: (I) the clinical group (90 patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment, 90 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 33 patients with Frontotemporal Dementia, and 34 patients with Vascular dementia, whose diagnoses were previously established according to a consensus that was reached by a multidisciplinary team, based on the international criteria) and (II) the healthy group (composed of 650 cognitively healthy community dwellers). The results show (i) an overall good fit for both the items and the persons' values, (ii) high variability for the cognitive performance level of the cognitive domains (ranging between 1.90 and -3.35, where &quot;Short-term Memory&quot; was the most difficult item and &quot;Spatial Orientation&quot; was the easiest item) and between the subjects on the scale, (iii) high reliability for the estimation of the persons' values, (iv) good discriminant validity and high diagnostic utility, and (v) a minimal differential item functioning effect related to of pathology, gender, age, and educational level.

"25942388","Age- and education-adjusted normative data for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in older adults age 70-99.","The original validation study for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) suggests a cutoff score of 26; however, this may be too stringent for older adults, particularly for those with less education. Given the rapidly increasing number of older adults and associated risk of dementia, this study aims to provide appropriate age- and education-adjusted norms for the MoCA. Data from 205 participants in an ongoing longevity study were used to derive normative data. Individuals were grouped based on age (70-79, 80-89, 90-99) and education level (=12 Years, 13-15, =16 Years). There were significant differences between age and education groups with younger and more educated participants outperforming their counterparts. Forty-six percent of our sample scored below the suggested cutoff of 26. These normative data may provide a more accurate representation of MoCA performance in older adults for specific age and education stratifications."
"25939560","MoCA as a Screening Tool of Neuropsychological Deficits in Alcohol-Dependent Patients.","BACKGROUND: Alcoholism is known to be associated with cognitive deficits mainly concerning visuospatial capacity, executive function, memory, and attention. These impairments may affect treatment efficacy which should therefore be adapted. We evaluated the potential utility of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to evaluate cognitive impairment in a large series of alcoholic patients hospitalized for withdrawal and rehabilitation.METHODS: Consecutive recruitment during a time period of patients admitted to an addiction treatment unit of a teaching hospital. Administration of the MoCA test on admission by trained staff members.RESULTS: A total of 166 patients aged 49.9 ± 9.2 years were included. Mean duration of administration was 20 minutes. The mean MoCA score was 23.5 ± 3.5 and 68.1% had an impaired value (&lt;26). Age was negatively and education was positively associated with the MoCA score. Significant cognitive deficits concerned visuospatial capacity, attention, fluency, abstraction, and delayed recall. Neither age nor sex was significantly related to the MoCA score, while having a high education level (&gt;12 years) significantly increased the likelihood of having a high MoCA score.CONCLUSIONS: Owing to their severity and frequency, screening for cognitive deficits is necessary in alcoholics during rehabilitation. MoCA is an appropriate tool for this purpose."

Patients with PD-MCI (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>28) were enrolled in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, single-site study of the rivastigmine transdermal patch. The primary outcome measure was the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC). Secondary outcomes included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Dementia Rating Scale-2 (DRS-2), Neurotrax computerized cognitive battery, the Everyday Cognition Battery (ECB), and the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8). Twenty-six participants (92.9%) completed both study phase assessments, and 23 (82.1%) completed both phases on study medication. The CGIC response rate demonstrated a trend effect in favor of rivastigmine (regression coefficient for interaction term in linear mixed-effects model<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.44, F[df]<U+2009>=<U+2009>3.01 [1, 24], P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.096).

"25896923","Relationship Between 24-Hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure and Cognitive Function in Community-Living Older Adults: The UCSD Ambulatory Blood Pressure Study.","BACKGROUND: Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) patterns have been associated with diminished cognitive function in hypertensive and very elderly populations. The relationship between ambulatory BP patterns and cognitive function in community-living older adults is unknown.METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in which 24-hour ambulatory BP, in-clinic BP, and cognitive function measures were obtained from 319 community-living older adults.RESULTS: The mean age was 72 years, 66% were female, and 13% were African-American. We performed linear regression with performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as the primary outcome and 24-hour BP patterns as the independent variable, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and comorbidities. Greater nighttime systolic dipping (P = 0.046) and higher 24-hour diastolic BP (DBP; P = 0.015) were both significantly associated with better cognitive function, whereas 24-hour systolic BP (SBP), average real variability, and ambulatory arterial stiffness were not.CONCLUSIONS: Higher 24-hour DBP and greater nighttime systolic dipping were significantly associated with improved cognitive function. Future studies should examine whether low 24-hour DBP and lack of nighttime systolic dipping predict future cognitive impairment."
"25868060","Evaluation of cognitive functions in gestational diabetes mellitus.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between cognitive functions and metabolic status in cases with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).METHODS: In this study 44 patients with GDM and 45 normal pregnant were included. Depression was evaluated with Beck's depression inventory (BDI). Cognitive functions were evaluated with Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA), paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT), spatial recall test (SRT), symbol digit modalities (SDMT), and word list generation (WLG).RESULTS: The mean gestational age, educational level and account of previous birth of the subjects in the study were not statistically different between the groups. The mean scores of BDI of the 2 groups were not statistically different. MOCA score and SDMT was significantly decreased in GDM in comparison to NP (p=0.005, p=0.04 respectively). Also, SDMT score was inversely correlated with number of pregnancies, postprandial blood glucose and HbA1c.The scores of PASAT, SRT, SPART and WLG were statistically similar between the groups.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may be a clue for early onset of impairment in cognitive functions in cases with new onset diabetes during pregnancy."

Data of HbA1c, blood lipids and inflammatory markers levels were collected.RESULTS: In all groups of patients levels of CRP, IL-6 and TNF-a were significantly higher as compared to controls. The highest level of inflammatory markers was detected in group with depressive mood and coexisting MCI, however IL-6 level didn't significantly differ as compared to MCI group. We founded correlations between all inflammatory markers in group of patients with depressive mood and in group of subjects with depressive symptoms and coexisting MCI. GDS-30 score was correlated with levels of inflammatory markers in group with depressive mood, and with levels of CRP and TNF-a in group with depressive mood and coexisting MCI. In the group with depressive mood and coexisting MCI we founded that MoCA score was negatively correlated with CRP and TNF-a levels; and HbA1c level was positively correlated with all inflammatory markers. The univariate logistic regression models revealed that variables which increased the likelihood of having been diagnosed with MCI in depressed patients were: higher levels of HbA1c, CRP, IL-6 and TNF-a, previous CVD or stroke, increased number of co-morbidities and microvascular complications, older age, less years of formal education. The multivariable model showed that previous CVD, higher HbA1c and IL-6 levels are significant factors.CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the presence of depressive syndrome is associated with higher levels of inflammatory markers in elderly patients with diabetes. The presence of MCI in these depressed subjects has additive effect on levels of inflammatory mediators."

The aim of this pilot study was to determine the feasibility of Maintenance of Certification in Anesthesiology Program (MOCA) patient and peer surveys in a selected group of American Board of Anesthesiology (ABA) diplomates.DESIGN: The design was a pilot test of survey instruments-MOCA Patient Care Survey and MOCA Peer Survey.SETTING: The setting was the ABA, Raleigh, NC.SUBJECTS: The subjects were ABA-certified anesthesiologists who were active examiners for the primary certification oral examination as of January 2013.MEASUREMENTS: Fifty-one participating physicians in the patient survey group distributed brochures, which included a link to the MOCA Patient Care Survey, to up to 100 consecutive patients at the point of care. Fifty-one participating physicians in the peer survey group distributed invitations to MOCA Peer Survey via e-mail to 20 peers in a variety of roles. Participants developed and evaluated a practice improvement plan based on survey results. Participants were also surveyed on their opinions on the feasibility of implementing the piloted survey instrument in their practices.MAIN RESULTS: Response rates for the patient care and the peer surveys were 15% and 75%, respectively. Both surveys indicated a high level of satisfaction with the diplomates; approximately two-thirds of physicians could not identify practice areas in need of improvement.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that threats to the validity of these surveys include distribution bias for peer surveys and response bias for patient surveys and that surveys often do not provide actionable information useful for practice improvement. Alternative approaches, such as including anesthesiologists within an integrated institutional evaluation system, could be explored to maximize the benefits of physician assessments provided by peers and patients."

However, there is controversy on the role of the stroke itself or the associated subcortical damage in post-stroke cognitive decline.AIM: To assess the independent contribution and the interaction of age, the stroke itself and diffuse subcortical damage in the poor cognitive performance observed in patients with stroke.METHODS: Atahualpa residents aged =60 years were identified during a door-to-door survey and invited to undergo brain MRI for identification of stroke lesions and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) of presumed vascular origin. Cognitive performance was evaluated by the use of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Using a generalized linear model, we examined the association between MoCA score, stroke and WMH, after adjusting for demographics, education, vascular risk factors, depression and edentulism.RESULTS: Out of 311 persons aged =60 years, 242 (78 %) were enrolled. MRI showed strokes in 39 (16 %) and moderate-to-severe WMH in 52 (22 %) cases. Mean MoCA score was 18.5 ± 4.7 in the entire population. When participants were stratified according to the median age of the population (67 years), the generalized linear model showed that MoCA scores were not different in younger persons irrespective of the presence of stroke or WMH. In contrast, increased age associated with lower MoCA scores in persons with WMH (p = 0.002) or with both stroke and WMH (p = 0.003), but not in those with stroke without WMH (p = 0.087).CONCLUSIONS: Interaction of age and diffuse subcortical damage are major determinants for poor cognitive performance among stroke patients."

We investigated the validity, reliability, and feasibility of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 5-minute protocol (MoCA 5-minute protocol) administered over the telephone.METHODS: Four items examining attention, verbal learning and memory, executive functions/language, and orientation were extracted from the MoCA to form the MoCA 5-minute protocol. One hundred four patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack, including 53 with normal cognition (Clinical Dementia Rating, 0) and 51 with cognitive impairment (Clinical Dementia Rating, 0.5 or 1), were administered the MoCA in clinic and a month later, the MoCA 5-minute protocol over the telephone.RESULTS: Administration of the MoCA 5-minute protocol took 5 minutes over the telephone. Total score of the MoCA 5-minute protocol correlated negatively with age (r=-0.36; P&lt;0.001) and positively with years of education (r=0.41; P&lt;0.001) but not with sex (<U+03C1>=0.03; P=0.773). Total scores of the MoCA and MoCA 5-minute protocol were highly correlated (r=0.87; P&lt;0.001). The MoCA 5-minute protocol performed equally well as the MoCA in differentiating patients with cognitive impairment from those without (areas under receiver operating characteristics curve for MoCA 5-minute protocol, 0.78; MoCA=0.74; P&gt;0.05 for difference; Cohen d for group difference, 0.80-1.13). It differentiated cognitively impaired patients with executive domain impairment from those without (areas under receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.89; P&lt;0.001; Cohen d=1.7 for group difference). Thirty-day test-retest reliability was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.89).CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA 5-minute protocol is a free, valid, and reliable cognitive screen for stroke and transient ischemic attack. It is brief and highly feasible for telephone administration."
"25673447","Memory dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus correlates with reduced hippocampal CA1 and subiculum volumes.","BACKGROUND: Little attention has been paid to the role of subcortical deep gray matter (SDGM) structures in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)-induced cognitive impairment, especially hippocampal subfields. Our aims were to assess the in vivo volumes of SDGM structures and hippocampal subfields using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to test their associations with cognitive performance in T2DM.METHODS: A total of 80 T2DM patients and 80 neurologically unimpaired healthy controls matched by age, sex and education level was enrolled in this study. We assessed the volumes of the SDGM structures and seven hippocampal subfields on MRI using a novel technique that enabled automated volumetry. We used Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores as measures of cognitive performance. The association of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) with SDGM structures and neuropsychological tests and correlations between hippocampal subfields and neuropsychological tests were assessed by partial correlation analysis in T2DM.RESULTS: Bilaterally, the hippocampal volumes were smaller in T2DM patients, mainly in the CA1 and subiculum subfields. Partial correlation analysis showed that the MoCA scores, particularly those regarding delayed memory, were significantly positively correlated with reduced hippocampal CA1 and subiculum volumes in T2DM patients. Additionally, higher HbA1c levels were significantly associated with poor memory performance and hippocampal atrophy among T2DM patients.CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the hippocampus might be the main affected region among the SDGM structures in T2DM. These structural changes in the hippocampal CA1 and subiculum areas might be at the core of underlying neurobiological mechanisms of hippocampal dysfunction, suggesting that degeneration in these regions could be responsible for memory impairments in T2DM patients."
"25653530","Aberrant spontaneous low-frequency brain activity in male patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea revealed by resting-state functional MRI.","BACKGROUND: The majority of previous neuroimaging studies have demonstrated both structural and functional abnormalities in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, few studies have focused on the regional intensity of spontaneous fluctuations during the resting state and the relationship between the abnormal properties and the behavioral performances. In the present study, we employed the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) method to explore the local features of spontaneous brain activity in OSA patients (OSAs).METHODS: Twenty-five untreated male severe OSAs and 25 age-matched and years-of-education-matched male good sleepers (GSs) were included in this study. The ALFF method was used to assess the local features of spontaneous brain activity. The mean signal values of the altered ALFF areas were analyzed with receiver operating characteristic curve. Partial correlation analysis was used to explore the relationship between the observed mean ALFF values of the different areas and the behavioral performances.RESULTS: Compared with GSs, OSAs had significantly higher scores for body mass index, apnea-hypopnea index, arterial oxygen saturation &lt;90%, arousal index, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score; furthermore, OSAs had significantly lower scores for rapid eye movement sleep and in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Compared with GSs, OSAs showed significant lower-ALFF areas in the cluster of the right precuneus and bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus, as well as a higher-ALFF area in the left inferior frontal gyrus. The area under the curve values of the lower- and higher-ALFF areas were 0.90 and 0.93, respectively. Further diagnostic analysis exhibited that the sensibility and specificity of the two clusters were 80% and 92%, respectively. The mean signal value of the lower-ALFF cluster displayed significant positive correlations with lowest oxygen saturation (r=0.447, P=0.025) and MoCA score (r =0.405, P=0.045).CONCLUSION: OSAs may involve in a dysfunction in the default mode network and an adaptive compensatory response in the frontal lobe, which reflect the underlying pathophysiology of cognitive impairment."
"25633767","Normative scores of the Cambridge Cognitive Examination-Revised in healthy Spanish population.","BACKGROUND: The Cambridge Cognitive Examination-Revised (CAMCOG) is widely used in clinical, epidemiological and research studies, but normative scores for age and educational level have not yet been established in the Spanish population.METHOD: The CAMCOG-R was administered to 730 adult members ofthe community, aged between 50-97 years, living throughout the region of Galicia. Initial screening yielded provisional identification of cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms. The final sample consisted of 643 cognitively healthy adults. The following instruments were administered: a questionnaire concerning socio-demographic and clinical data, the Charlson's Comorbidity Index, the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Lawton and Brody Index, a short version of the Geriatric Depression Scale, and the CASP-19 quality of life scale.RESULTS: Internal consistency values of the CAMCOG-R were similar to those obtained for the original scale. The convergent validity between MoCA and CAMCOG-R was good, and the divergent validity between CASP-19 and CAMCOG-R was higher than the recommended value. Percentiles and inter-quartile range for age and educational level were calculated.CONCLUSIONS: Psychometric indexes showed that the CAMCOG-R is a reliable and valid instrument, which can generally avoid a ceiling effect. The study findings confirm the importance of specifying the normative data by age and educational level."

Based on the results of apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), they were divided into 4 groups of primary snoring (n = 18), mild OSAHS(n = 23), moderate OSAHS (n = 29) and severe OSAHS (n = 69). The questionnaires of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were administered to assess cognitive function and daytime sleepiness. The serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP), leptin and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) were detected to evaluate systemic inflammation. The questionnaire scores, serum levels of Hs-CRP, leptin and TNF-a and PSG parameters were compared among 4 groups. Thirty-three patients in severe OSAHS group (treatment group) with good adherence were evaluated at baseline and after long-time CPAP treatment.RESULTS: Compared to primary snoring group, the serum Hs-CRP ((1.77 ± 1.19) vs (0.92 ± 0.82) mg/L), leptin ((15.21 ± 13.26) vs (6.35 ± 4.51) mmol/L) and TNF-a ((21.04 ± 7.78) vs (10.30 ± 5.23) pmol/L) levels increased significantly in severe OSAHS group (P &lt; 0.05). After adjusting for body mass index (BMI), age and education years, MoCA scores showed negative correlations with serum TNF-a, AHI, oxygen reduction index (ODI) and TS90% (r = -0.266, -0.236, -0.201, -0.18 respectively, all P &lt; 0.05) and positive correlations with minimum oxygen saturation (LSaO(2)) (r = 0.224, P &lt; 0.05). The evaluations of MoCA subdomains further revealed selective reductions in visual space, executive function, attention and delayed memory function. The treatment group with good adherence to &gt; 6-month continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment and after CPAP treatment, the serum levels of Hs-CRP, TNF-a and leptin improved markedly ((1.20 ± 0.88) vs (2.03 ± 1.58) mg/L, (14.12 ± 4.34) vs (22.74 ± 6.72) pmol/L and (7.37 ± 5.30) vs (13.69 ± 7.17) mmol/L respectively). The scores of MoCA and ESS also improved (27.79 ± 1.69 vs 24.76 ± 2.57, 4.33 ± 3.14 vs 12.61 ± 5.80 respectively) (all P &lt; 0.01). The score of all MoCA subdomains improved after treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive dysfunction and inflammatory reaction are common in OSAHS patients. MoCA scores are correlated significantly with serum level of TNF-a and nocturnal intermittent hypoxia. Systemic inflammation may play an important role in cognitive dysfunction of OSAHS patients. And long-time CPAP treatment can improve systemic inflammatory response and cognitive impairment."

Their demographic and clinical features, including age, disease duration, education level, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III, Hoehn-Yahr Scale, activities of daily living, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale score were recorded. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Chinese Revision (WAIS-RC) and Wechsler Memory Scale-Chinese Revision (WMS-RC) scores were compared to distinguish the cognitive properties between the two groups. The MMSE values did not show a significant difference between the groups. However, the MoCA scores of male patients were significantly higher than those of female patients (adjusted p&lt;0.05). The male group demonstrated better performances with respect to visuospatial function, naming and abstraction (adjusted p&lt;0.05). The WAIS-RC data showed that female patients had lower scores in information, vocabulary, picture completion, block design and picture arrangement (adjusted p&lt;0.05), and the WMS-RC data showed that 100-1 and cumulative addition abilities were significantly weaker in females than males (adjusted p&lt;0.05).

"25575807","The relationship between the degree of cognitive impairment and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness.","The goal of the present study is to investigate the relationship between the degree of cognitive impairment and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness which is measured by the optical coherence tomography (OCT). Thirty-five patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 35 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 35 healthy volunteers, between the ages of 60-87, who were examined in the neurology outpatient clinic among 2012-2013 were prospectively involved in our study. Mini mental state examination (MMSE) test, montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA), and also neuropsychological test batteries were used for the neurocognitive evaluation. RNFL thickness was measured by the OCT technique and the differences among groups were studied. The relationship between RNFL thickness and MMSE scores with demographic characteristics was investigated. RNFL thickness was significantly lower in AD and MCI groups compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.01). No significant differences of RNFL were found between the MCI and the AD groups (p &gt; 0.05). Significant correlation was found between MMSE scores and the RNFL values (p &lt; 0.05). Significant thinning in RNFL along with age was detected (p &lt; 0.05). In our study, it is thought that retinal nerve fiber degeneration and central nervous system degeneration may be concurrent according to the thinning of RNFL measured by OCT in AD and MCI groups. RNFL measurement may also be useful for early diagnosis and evaluation of the disease progression. Further studies are needed to optimize the utility of this method as an ocular biomarker in AD."
"25572449","Montreal Cognitive Assessment for screening mild cognitive impairment: variations in test performance and scores by education in Singapore.","BACKGROUND: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was developed as a screening instrument for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We evaluated the MoCA's test performance by educational groups among older Singaporean Chinese adults.METHOD: The MoCA and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were evaluated in two independent studies (clinic-based sample and community-based sample) of MCI and normal cognition (NC) controls, using receiver operating characteristic curve analyses: area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity (Sn), and specificity (Sp).RESULTS: The MoCA modestly discriminated MCI from NC in both study samples (AUC = 0.63 and 0.65): Sn = 0.64 and Sp = 0.36 at a cut-off of 28/29 in the clinic-based sample, and Sn = 0.65 and Sp = 0.55 at a cut-off of 22/23 in the community-based sample. The MoCA's test performance was least satisfactory in the highest (&gt;6 years) education group: AUC = 0.50 (p = 0.98), Sn = 0.54, and Sp = 0.51 at a cut-off of 27/28. Overall, the MoCA's test performance was not better than that of the MMSE. In multivariate analyses controlling for age and gender, MCI diagnosis was associated with a &lt;1-point decrement in MoCA score (<U+03B7>(2) = 0.010), but lower (1-6 years) and no education was associated with a 3- to 5-point decrement (<U+03B7>(2) = 0.115 and <U+03B7>(2) = 0.162, respectively).CONCLUSION: The MoCA's ability to discriminate MCI from NC was modest in this Chinese population, because it was far more sensitive to the effect of education than MCI diagnosis."
"25560276","Evaluating the relationship between education level and cognitive impairment with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test.","BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is defined as 'a cognitive decline greater than that expected for an individual's age and education level but that does not interfere notably with activities of daily life'. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a screening test for MCI.METHODS: We investigated the performance of the Turkish version of the MoCA in detecting MCI among elderly persons in a rural area, the majority of whom have a low level of education. We evaluated 50 consecutive men referred from an outpatient clinic. Educational level was divided into three categories: group 1, less than primary (&lt;5 years); group 2, primary (5 years); group 3, more than primary (&gt;5 years). We evaluated the effect of education on MoCA scores and compared subjects' test performance among the different categories of education level.RESULTS: A total of 50 male patients with MCI (mean age: 70.74 ± 7.87) met the inclusion criteria. There were no differences in the total scores based on education or in the subscores for visuospatial/executive function, naming, attention, abstraction and delayed recall. Language was the only domain that showed significant differences between the groups. In post-hoc analysis, differences were found between groups 1 and 3 and between groups 1 and 2. Group 1 had significantly lower scores for language. The repeat subscore for language was significantly lower in group 1 than in group 2. In fluency, there were significant differences between groups 2 and 3 and between group 1 and 3.CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the applicability of the Turkish version of MoCA in populations with little education. Our results emphasize the need to adapt the language sections of this test, so it can be easily used in populations with low education levels."

However, it remains unknown whether the gray matter volume is altered in COPD patients with subclinical cognitive impairment. To determine whether any gray matter abnormalities are present in these patients, neuropsychological tests and structural MRI data were analyzed from 60 patients with COPD and 60 age-, gender-, education-, and handedness-matched normal controls (NCs). The COPD patients had similar Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores compared with the NCs. However, they had reduced Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores for visuospatial and executive and naming and memory functions (P &lt; 0.001). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis revealed that the COPD patients had significantly lowered gray matter volumes in several brain regions, including the left precuneus (PrCU), bilateral calcarine (CAL), right superior temporal gyrus/middle temporal gyrus (STG/MTG), bilateral fusiform gyrus (FG), and right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) (P &lt; 0.01, corrected). Importantly, the forced vital capacity (FVC) was found to be associated with the gray matter volume in the calcarine. The present study confirmed that brain structural changes were present in stable COPD patients with subclinical cognitive impairment. These findings may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of COPD."

The objective of the present study was to explore the associations of MetS and its individual components with the risks of cognitive impairment and neurological dysfunction in patients after acute stroke.METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 840 patients ranging in age from 53 to 89 years from the Tianjin area of North China. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination. Neuropsychiatric behavior was assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire. Emotional state was examined according to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and neuromotor function was evaluated using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Barthel index, and the Activity of Daily Living test. After overnight fasting, blood samples were obtained to measure biochemistry indicators.RESULTS: MetS and its individual components were closely correlated with MoCA score. MetS patients had high levels of inflammation and a 3.542-fold increased odds ratio (OR) for cognitive impairment [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.972-6.361]. Of the individual MetS components, central obesity (OR 3.039; 95% CI: 1.839-5.023), high fasting plasma glucose (OR 1.915; 95% CI: 1.016-3.607), and type 2 diabetes (OR 2.241; 95% CI: 1.630-3.081) were associated with an increased incidence of cognitive impairment.

We investigated whether the G2385R polymorphism in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2), a risk variant for the development of PD in East Asians, is associated with cognitive dysfunction in PD. We recruited 299 PD patients, consisting of 23 carriers and 276 non-carriers of LRRK2 G2385R, from 14 centers. Global cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). PD with cognitive dysfunction was defined as an MMSE Z score that, adjusting for age at study entry and years of education, was below -1.0 standard deviations. In multivariate analysis, PD duration, age at study entry and depression were significant risk factors for cognitive dysfunction as assessed by MMSE performance or the MoCA. In linear regression analysis of the association between MMSE Z scores and PD duration, there was no significant difference associated with the LRRK2 G2385R genotype. The interaction terms between PD duration and the LRRK2 G2385R genotype were not significant for the MMSE Z score but were significant for the MoCA. In conclusion, the LRRK2 G2385R genotype may not be associated with cognitive dysfunction in PD."
"26845223","Determining appropriate screening tools and cut-points for cognitive impairment in an elderly Chinese sample.","The establishment of normative data and screening cut-points for cognitive tasks is important to ensure the effective and timely detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). These need to be culturally relevant and account for known factors that impact on cognition such as age, education, and gender. In this study, 1,068 elderly Chinese residents of Shanghai completed a comprehensive series of cognitive tasks as part of a community screening study with 1027 meeting criteria for analysis, age M(SD) = 72.54 (8.40). MCI was detected in 267 individuals, AD in 50, and 710 had normal cognition. Receiver Operator Characteristic curve analysis indicated that the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) best differentiated normal cognition from MCI and AD. We present suggested cut-points to differentiate between normal cognition and MCI and AD for the total sample, and when split according to education levels, age, and gender. Trends suggest that the MoCA was better suited to detecting MCI, and the MMSE was better for detecting AD. For younger and more educated participants, only a slight impairment was necessary to meet screening criteria, while a larger impairment was necessary for older and less educated participants. Both tasks had a high negative predictive values for MCI and AD, and variable positive predictive values. The cut-points presented can be used to inform future work using the MMSE and MoCA to screen for MCI and AD in older Chinese people. (PsycINFO Database Record"

However, long-term studies on PSCI are scarce and may be influenced by assessment methods and selection bias. We aimed to (i) assess the prevalence of long-term PSCI; (ii) compare two common cognitive assessment instruments; and (iii) compare cognitive function of long-term stroke survivors with non-stroke persons.METHODS: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were administered to 10-year survivors from a population-based cohort of first-ever stroke patients included in the Lund Stroke Register, Sweden, in 2001-2002. PSCI was defined as MMSE&lt;27 and/or MoCA&lt;25 and severe cognitive impairment as MMSE&lt;23. Age- and sex-matched non-stroke control subjects who had performed MMSE (but not MoCA) were recruited from the longitudinal population study &quot;Good Ageing in Skåne.&quot; The odds of having cognitive impairment for stroke survivors compared to controls were examined with logistic regression analyses adjusting for education.RESULTS: Of 145 stroke survivors after 10 years, 127 participated. MMSE showed PSCI in 46%, whereas MoCA displayed PSCI in 61%. Among the stroke survivors with MoCA&lt;25, 35% had MMSE=27 (P&lt;.001). The odds of having severe cognitive impairment defined as MMSE&lt;23 were higher among the stroke survivors compared to 354 controls (education-adjusted; OR=2.5; P=.004).CONCLUSIONS: Post-stroke cognitive impairment was prevalent among 10-year stroke survivors, and the odds of having severe cognitive impairment were higher among the stroke survivors compared to non-stroke persons. The burden of long-term PSCI might have been underestimated previously, and MoCA may be more suitable than MMSE to detect long-term PSCI."

"27733822","The Facilitative Effect of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Visuospatial Working Memory in Patients with Diabetic Polyneuropathy: A Pre-post Sham-Controlled Study.","Diabetes mellitus can lead to diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) and cognitive deficits that manifest as peripheral and central neuropathy, respectively. In this study we investigated the relationship between visuospatial working memory (VSWM) capacity and DPN severity, and attempted to improve VSWM in DPN patients via the use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Sixteen DPN patients and 16 age- and education-matched healthy control subjects received Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) for baseline cognitive assessment. A forward- and backward-recall computerized Corsi block tapping task (CBT), both with and without a concurrent motor interference task was used to measure VSWM capacity. Each DPN patient underwent a pre-treatment CBT, followed by tDCS or sham treatment, then a post-treatment CBT on two separate days. We found that although patients with severe DPN (Dyck's grade 2a or 2b) showed comparable general intelligence scores on WAIS-IV as their age- and education-matched healthy counterparts, they nonetheless showed mild cognitive impairment (MCI) on MOCA and working memory deficit on digit-span test of WAIS-IV. Furthermore, patients' peripheral nerve conduction velocity (NCV) was positively correlated with their VSWM span in the most difficult CBT condition that involved backward-recall with motor interference such that patients with worse NCV also had lower VSWM span. Most importantly, anodal tDCS over the right DLPFC was able to improve low-performing patients' VSWM span to be on par with the high-performers, thereby eliminating the correlation between NCV and VSWM. In summary, these findings suggest that (1) MCI and severe peripheral neuropathy can coexist with unequal severity in diabetic patients, (2) the positive correlation of VSWM and NCV suggests a link between peripheral and central neuropathies, and (3) anodal tDCS over the right DLPFC can improve DPN patients' VSWM, particularly for the low-performing patients."

With regard to disease, they were detected preferably in cortical or subcortical areas, respectively. This result can be used in the differential diagnosis. Single subcortical CMB accompanied by a smaller number of lacunae and less severe leukoaraiosis were identified in 48% of patients with DLB. In AD with additional features of DLB and cerebrovascular disease, CMB were more common (60%) that was a predictor of mixed pathology.CONCLUSION: Leukoaraiosis, if accompanied by CMB, has a great clinical significance in neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases with cognitive impairment. CMB is a marker of severe cognitive impairment and predictor of mixed pathology in the cortical-subcortical localization of CMB and corresponding neuropsychological profile."

"27680398","Cognitive Functions, Concentration of Endogenous Estradiol, Estrogen Receptor a (ERa) Polymorphism in Postmenopausal Women.","BACKGROUND The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between cognitive functions and the level of endogenous estradiol in postmenopausal women, according to which estrogen receptor a (ERa) polymorphism the woman carries. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study group consisted of 210 women. The inclusion criteria were: minimum 2 years after the last menstruation, FSH concentration 30 U/ml, and no dementia signs on Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). A computerized battery of Central Nervous System Vital Signs (CNS VS) test was used to diagnose cognitive functions. Genotyping of the ERa polymorphism was performed using a polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzymes (PCR-RFLP). Blood plasma was tested for FSH and estradiol (E2). Statistical analysis was performed using STATISTICA software. RESULTS A relationship was confirmed between standard scores for 3 cognitive functions: general memory, verbal memory, and processing speed, and the XbaI polymorphism in the women in the study. In the group of women with genotype TT PvuII, significant positive relationships were observed between the concentration of E2 and the standard scores of 3 cognitive functions: general memory, verbal memory, and processing speed. In the group of women with genotype TC PvuII, significant negative correlations were found between the concentration of E2 and the standard scores of 4 cognitive functions: NCI, general memory, verbal memory, and processing speed. CONCLUSIONS ERa polymorphism exerted an effect on the interaction between the concentration of estradiol and the results for cognitive functions. The concentration of estradiol did not depend on Xba1 and PvuII polymorphisms. The results for cognitive functions depended on which Xba1 polymorphism the woman carried."

Predictive values of the K-MMSE and K-MoCA for dementia or MCI were analyzed in groups divided by educational level.RESULTS: The discriminative powers of the K-MMSE and K-MoCA were excellent [area under the curve (AUC) 0.86-0.97] for detecting dementia but not for detecting MCI (AUC 0.64-0.85).

"27634030","Does Coronary Angiography and Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Affect Cognitive Function?","Cerebral microemboli are frequently observed during coronary angiography (CA) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and their numbers have been related to the vascular access site used. Although cerebral microemboli can cause silent cerebral lesions, their clinical impact is debated. To study this, 93 patients referred for CA or PCI underwent serial cognitive testing using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test to detect postprocedural cognitive impairment. Patients were randomized to radial or femoral access. In a subgroup of 35 patients, the number of cerebral microemboli was monitored with transcranial Doppler technique. We found the median precatheterization result of the MoCA test to be 27, and it did not change significantly 4 and 31 days, respectively, after the procedure. There was no significant correlation between the number of cerebral microemboli and the difference between preprocedural and postprocedural MoCA tests. The test results did not differ between vascular access sites. One-third of the patients had a precatheterization median MoCA test result &lt;26 corresponding to mild cognitive impairment. In conclusion, using the MoCA test, we could not detect any cognitive impairment after CA or PCI, and no significant correlations were found between the results of the MoCA test and cerebral microemboli or vascular access site, respectively. In patients with suspected coronary heart disease, mild cognitive impairment was common."
"27625048","Normative Data for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in Middle-Aged and Elderly Quebec-French People.","OBJECTIVE: Given that aging is associated with higher risk of cognitive decline and dementia, improving early detection of cognitive impairment has become a research and clinical priority. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a screening instrument used to assess different aspects of cognition. Despite its widespread use, norms adjusted to the sociodemographics of Quebec-French people are not yet available. Such norms are however important because performance on neuropsychological tests varies according to sociodemographic variables including age, sex, and education. As such, the present study aimed to establish normative data for the MoCA in middle-aged and elderly Quebec-French population.METHOD: For that purpose, 1,019 community-dwelling older adults aged between 41 and 98 were recruited. Participants from 12 recruiting sites completed the MoCA. Regression-based normative data were produced and cross-validated with a validation sample (n = 200).CONCLUSIONS: This study provides normative data for the MoCA test in the middle-aged and elderly French-Quebec people. These data will facilitate more accurate detection and follow-up of the risk of cognitive impairment in this population, taking into account culture, age, education, and sex."
"27603353","Abnormal functional connectivity density in patients with ischemic white matter lesions: An observational study.","White matter lesions (WMLs) are frequently detected in elderly people. Previous structural and functional studies have demonstrated that WMLs are associated with cognitive and motor decline. However, the underlying mechanism of how WMLs lead to cognitive decline and motor disturbance remains unclear. We used functional connectivity density mapping (FCDM) to investigate changes in brain functional connectivity in 16 patients with ischemic WMLs and 13 controls. Both short- and long-range FCD maps were computed, and group comparisons were performed between the 2 groups. A correlation analysis was further performed between regions with altered FCD and cognitive test scores (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] and Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]) in the patient group. We found that patients with ischemic WMLs showed reduced short-range FCD in the temporal cortex, primary motor cortex, and subcortical region, which may account for inadequate top-down attention, impaired motor, memory, and executive function associated with WMLs. The positive correlation between primary motor cortex and MoCA scores may provide evidence for the influences of cognitive function on behavioral performance. The inferior parietal cortex exhibited increased short-range FCD, reflecting a hyper bottom-up attention to compensate for the inadequate top-down attention for language comprehension and information retrieval in patients with WMLs. Moreover, the prefrontal and primary motor cortex showed increased long-range FCD and the former positively correlated with MoCA scores, which may suggest a strategy of cortical functional reorganization to compensate for motor and executive deficits. Our findings provide new insights into how WMLs cause cognitive and motor decline from cortical functional connectivity perspective. "

"29465890","[The effect of anesthesia on cognitive functions].","Aim of the study - General anesthetics, arterial hypotension and hypoxia developing during anesthesia may result in impaired memory and a decline in other abilities (such as attention, concentration, linguistic and writing abilities). Our aim was to detect changes in cognitive functions due to surgery and anesthesia with controlled arterial hypotension. Materials and methods - We studied combined and intravenous anesthesia detecting pre-and postoperative cognitive functions, intraoperative haemodynamic parameters, demographic data, other data of case history and surgical data. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment test was applied in the randomized, prospective study. The preoperative data served as basis for comparison. The second test was performed following surgery when patients were fully awake. Both groups included 30 patients. Results and conclusion - After both narcosis methods (postoperative second hour) cognitive functions were significantly deteriorated (p&lt;0.05). Median MoCA before sevoflurane anesthesia was 24 points (interquartile range: 22-25), postoperative value was 20 (19-21) (p&lt;0.05). Median MoCA before propofol anesthesia was 24 points (23-26), postoperative value was 20 (18-22) (p&lt;0.01). Intraoperative arterial blood pressure, pulse rate and oxygen saturation values did not correlate with worsening of cognitive function (Pearson correlation coefficient values between -0.19 and 0.42).

"27453887","Correlation of MRI findings and cognitive function in multiple sclerosis patients using montreal cognitive assessment test.","BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has improved the diagnosis and management of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a brief, sensitive test that has been recommended by National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke and Canadian Stroke Network (NINDS-CSN) as a reliable tool to detect mild cognitive impairments. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between MoCA test and its sub-items with brain abnormalities in MRI of MS patients.METHODS: Based on MRI scans of 46 MS patients, third ventricle and white matter lesions volumes were measured. Disease duration and expanded disability status scale (EDSS) were recorded in each patient. In addition, cognitive domains of the patients were evaluated by Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) test. We analyzed data using t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, Pearson correlation coefficient, and non-parametric Spearman test. Furthermore, multiple linear regression model was applied to evaluate the association between cognitive indices and MRI characteristics.RESULTS: Among MRI indices, only severity of atrophy showed a significant difference between cognitively impaired and cognitively preserved patients. Third ventricular volume was significantly correlated with total MoCA score (p=0.003, r=-0.42), but none of the juxtacortical or periventricular lesions volume revealed significant relation with total MoCA score. However, using multivariate linear regression after adjustment for educational level and disease duration, there was a significant negative association between juxtacortical lesions volume and total MoCA score as well as naming and attention sub-items. Also, memory score was adversely associated with the third ventricular volume (p=0.03, r=0.31).CONCLUSION: Cognitive disturbances detected by MoCA, may be associated with some pathological changes including atrophy, third ventricular volume, and juxtacortical lesion. MoCA, as a brief test, is not correlated with brain lesions volume in MS patients."
"27448517","Apathy in multiple sclerosis: gender matters.","Apathy has been recognized as a frequent symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS) but uncertainty remains about its prevalence and clinical correlates. Therefore, the objective of this work was to assess the prevalence of apathy in patients with MS and to identify clinical and demographic correlates. A case-control study with 30 patients and 30 healthy controls matched for age, gender and education was performed. Apathy diagnosis was established using Robert et al.'s criteria. Additionally, apathy was assessed using the 10-item short version of the clinical-rated Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-C-10). The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were used to evaluate depression, fatigue and cognitive impairment, respectively. Apathy prevalence in MS patients was 43.3%. Patients with MS had higher AES-C-10 scores than controls (13.9 vs. 12.0, p=0.015). Patients with apathy presented a higher proportion of males (53.8% vs. 11.8%, p=0.02), lower educational level (53.8% vs. 11.8% of patients with up to 9years of education), higher scores on cognitive dimension of MFIS (18.0 vs. 8.0, p=0.048) and BDI (13.0 vs. 7.0, p=0.035) and worse performance on MoCA (24.0 vs. 26.0, p=0.028). Gender was the only independent predictor of apathy, with men presenting a higher risk compared to women (OR: 9.62; 95%CI: 1.02-90.61; p=0.048). In conclusion, apathy is a common neuropsychiatric disorder in MS and it is probably underdiagnosed. Male patients seem to have an increased risk of apathy, and this finding may be related to the generally more unfavorable course of MS in men."

The study was performed at two trial sites. We studied 136 outpatients with cognitive decline. MRI was performed using a magnetic field of 1.5 and 3 T. Neuropsychological assessment included Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale (MoCA), Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-R), Cambridge Cognitive Examination battery (CAMCOG) (Part 3), Clock Drawing Test, fluency test and the visual memory test (SCT). CSF was examined for standard parameters such as tau, phosphorylated tau, amyloid-ß 1-40 and 42 and Qalbumin, in accordance with established protocols and genotype. In 61 patients (45 %), at least 1 CMB was found. Most of the CMBs were described in the amnestic profile (67 %). In 86 % of the cases, multiple CMB were observed. The ratio of Aß1-40/42 in non-amnestic patients with CMB was significantly lower (mean 0.6) than in patients without CMB (mean 1.2). A notable difference in the albumin ratio as an indicator of the BBB was observed between groups with and without CMB. In the CMP-positive group, the E2 genotype was observed more frequently, and the E4 genotype less frequently, than in the CMB-negative group. Based on the cerebrospinal fluid-serum albumin ratio, we were able to show that patients with CMB present several features of BBB dysfunction. According to logistic regression, the predictive factors for CMB in patients with cognitive decline were age, WMHs score and albumin ratio. We found a significant reduction in the Aß-amyloid ratio in the non-amnestic profile group with CMB (particularly in the cortical region) in comparison to those without CMB. While this is an interesting finding, its significance needs to be assessed in a prospective follow-up. "

"27347084","Efficacy of memantine on neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with the severity of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia: A six-month, open-label, self-controlled clinical trial.","Previous studies have focused on the curative effects of memantine in patients with mild-to-moderate frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD); however, its benefits in patients with moderate-to-severe FTLD have not been investigated. The present study explores the behavioral, cognitive and functional effects of memantine on behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) in patients with mild and moderate-to-severe stage bvFTD. A total of 42 patients with bvFTD completed a 6-month treatment plan of 20 mg memantine daily in an open-label, self-controlled clinical trial. Patients were divided into two groups according to their Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score: Mild (score, 21-26); and moderate-to-severe (score, 4-20). Primary endpoints included Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) and Clinic Dementia Rating (CDR) scores, and secondary endpoints comprised Neuropsychiatric Inventory Caregiver Distress Scale (NPI-D), MMSE, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Activity of Daily Life (ADL) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores. Memantine treatment had no effect on overall NPI-Q scores, with the exception of the agitation subdomain in all patients with bvFTD. However, patients with moderate-to-severe bvFTD exhibited a better performance than patients with mild bvFTD, demonstrated by improved NPI-Q total scores and subscales of agitation, depression, apathy and disinhibition. In the moderate-to-severe group, CDR and HAMD scores remained stable, but MMSE, MoCA and ADL scores were reduced after 6 months of treatment. Memantine was well-tolerated in patients. In conclusion, patients with moderate-to-severe bvFTD responded significantly better to memantine in comparison to patients with mild bvFTD with regard to their neuropsychiatric scores, while memantine did not present any cognitive or functional benefits in patients with mild bvFTD. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with a larger number of patients is required to verify these promising results for patients with moderate-to-severe bvFTD."
"27334897","Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) performance in progressive supranuclear palsy and multiple system atrophy.","To determine if Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is more sensitive than the commonly used Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in detecting cognitive abnormalities in patients with probable progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) compared with Parkinson's disease (PD). In this multicenter observational study, MMSE and MoCA were administered in a random order to 130 patients: 35 MSA, 30 PSP and 65 age, and education and gender matched-PD. We assessed between-group differences for MMSE, MoCA, and their subitems. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated. The mean MMSE was higher than the mean MoCA score in each MSA (27.7 ± 2.4 vs. 22.9 ± 3.0, p &lt; 0.0001), PSP (26.0 ± 2.9 vs. 18.2 ± 3.9, p &lt; 0.0001), and PD (27.3 ± 2.0 vs. 22.3 ± 3.5, p &lt; 0.0001). MoCA total score as well as its letter fluency subitem differentiated PSP from MSA and PD with high specificity and moderate sensitivity. More specifically, a cut-off score of 7 F-words or less per minute would support a diagnosis of PSP (PSP vs. PD: 86 % specificity, 70 % sensitivity; PSP vs. MSA: 71 % specificity, 70 % sensitivity). By contrast, MMSE presented an overall ceiling effect for most subitems, except for the pentagon scores, where PSP did less well than MSA or PD patients. These preliminary results suggest that PSP and MSA, similar to PD patients, may present normal MMSE and reduced MoCA performance. Overall, MoCA is more sensitive than MMSE in detecting cognitive impairment in atypical parkinsonism and together with verbal fluency would be a useful test to support PSP diagnosis."
"27318033","Changes in Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scores Over Time.","This study explored the utility of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in the detection of cognitive change over time in a community sample (age ranging from 58 to 77 years). The MoCA was administered twice approximately 3.5 years apart ( n = 139). Participants were classified as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or cognitively intact at follow-up based on multidisciplinary consensus. We excluded 33 participants who endorsed cognitive complaints at baseline. The MCI group ( n = 53) showed a significant decrease in MoCA scores ( M = -1.83, p &lt; .001, d = 0.64). When accounting for age and education, the MCI group showed a decline of 1.7 points, while cognitively intact participants remained stable. Using Reliable Change Indices established by cognitively intact group, 42% of MCI participants demonstrated a decline in MoCA scores. Results suggest that the MoCA can detect cognitive change in MCI over a 3.5-year period and preliminarily supports the utility of the MoCA as a repeatable brief cognitive screening measure."

Brief and sensitive screening tools are needed. We evaluated the accuracy of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) compared to the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) to detect cognitive impairment in HIV-infected participants.METHOD: HIV-infected patients were consecutively enrolled during routine outpatient visits at a single institution. The MoCA, the MMSE, and a comprehensive neuropsychological battery were administered. Patients were considered as affected by cognitive impairment if they showed decreased cognitive function in at least two ability domains based on age and education adjusted Italian normative cut-offs.RESULTS: Ninety-three HIV-infected participants (75% males, median age 47, all on antiretroviral therapy; 90% HIV-RNA &lt;50copies/mL, median CD4 644 cells/µL) were enrolled. Thirteen participants (14%) were diagnosed as cognitively compromised via a comprehensive neuropsychological examination. The area under the curve of the adjusted MMSE and MoCA scores to detect cognitive impairment were .51 (95% CI = .31-.72, p = .877) and .70 (95% CI = .53-.86, p = .025), respectively. A MoCA score &lt;22 was able to predict the cognitive impairment with 62% of sensitivity and 76% of specificity.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that the prognostic performance of the MoCA to detect cognitive impairment among mildly impaired HIV-infected participants was only moderate. Further investigations are needed to identify optimal cognitive tests to screen HIV-infected individuals or to explore whether a combination of cognitive tests might represent a viable alternative to a single screening tool."

"27063610","Identifying Prevalence and Risk Factors for Mild Cognitive Impairment in Adults Presenting for Urological Evaluation.","OBJECTIVE: To examine mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in a young and older adult urology population, and which external factors were associated with diminished cognitive status at baseline.METHODS: We enrolled patients &gt;18 years of age presenting to a large, urban tertiary care center for a wide variety of urologic complaints. Cognitive status was determined by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) screening test. A score of 26-30 on the MoCA is considered cognitively intact, whereas &lt;26 indicates MCI. Patient charts were retrospectively reviewed; a backwards-stepwise logistic regression was constructed to compare MCI with potential risk factors.RESULTS: One hundred ninety-seven patients were included. There were 10/33 (30%) patients aged 18-40 who had MCI. Moreover, 32/68 (47%) patients aged 41-64 had MCI. Of older adults age 65+, MCI was seen in 65/96 (68%) patients. Factors associated with MCI in age group 41-64 included opioid use. Patients with stone disease were less likely to demonstrate MCI, when compared to other general categories of urologic chief complaints. For patients in age group 65+, associations with MCI included a cancer-related chief complaint, increased age, depressive symptoms, and less education. There were no significant associations with MCI in age group 18-40.CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate a significant prevalence of MCI in an adult urology population and factors that may be associated with its prevalence. We believe that this study lays the groundwork for urology providers to be able to identify patients who may have MCI at baseline."

"27051070","Cognitive Function as a Mediator in the Relationship Between Physical Activity and Depression Status in Older Adults.","Previous research has found that increased physical activity may provide a protective effect on depression status; however, these studies do not account for cognitive function. This study's aim was to determine whether cognitive function mediates the association between physical activity depression status in older adults. Data from 501 older adults were used for this analysis. Physical activity had a significant protective effect on depression (OR = 0.761, 95% CI [0.65, 0.89], p = .001). Adjusted analysis yielded an attenuated association (OR = 0.81, 95% CI [0.69, 0.95], p = .01) with a significant interaction for physical activity and cognitive function (OR = 0.991, 95% CI [0.985, 0.997], p = .005). MoCA performance also had a significant mediating effect on the relationship between physical activity and depression status (p = .04). These findings suggest that cognitive function is associated with, and does mediate, the relationship between physical activity and depression status."
"27049362","Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) screening mild cognitive impairment in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) pre-dialysis.","INTRODUCTION: Individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at higher risk of developing cognitive impairment (CI), initially mild (MCI), potentially identifiable, but still poorly diagnosed and treated. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has been indicated for MCI screening in CKD.OBJECTIVE: To assess MCI in patients with CKD not yet on dialysis.METHODS: Study conducted in 72 non-elderly subjects with pre-dialysis CKD. The neuropsychological assessment included: The global cognitive assessment test MoCA; the clock drawing (CD); the digit span forward (DSF) and reverse (DSR); phonemic verbal (VF) fluency (FAS) and semantics (animals); the fist-edge-palm (FEP); and the memory 10 pictures.RESULTS: The average age of the participants was 56.74 ± 7.63 years, with predominance of male sex (55.6%), mainly with = 4 years of education (84.3%), with CKD cathegories 1, 2 and 3a and 3b (67.6%), hypertension (93.1%) and diabetes mellitus (52.1%). MCI (MoCA = 24) was observed in 73.6% of the patients. We did not find association among MCI with demographic and clinical variables, but a tendency to association with age (p = 0.07), educational level (p= 0.06) and diabetes (0.06). The executive function tests CD, DS-reverse and FEP, individually were able to identify CI with good sensibility and negative predictive value compared to MoCA and together, showed the same capability to identify MCI when compared to MoCA.CONCLUSION: The MCI is common in non-elderly patients with CKD not yet on dialysis. Together, the CD, DSR and FEP showed similar performance in identify MCI in this population when compared to MoCA, suggesting impairment of executive functions."

"26993342","Effect of CPAP therapy on C-reactive protein and cognitive impairment in patients with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome.","PURPOSE: Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is associated with neurocognitive impairment. We examined the role of the systemic inflammatory response, measured by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) assay, and the effect of CPAP treatment on hsCRP and cognitive impairment in patients with OSAHS.METHODS: Eligible subjects (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>178) were categorized into two groups: absent or mild OSAHS, and moderate to severe OSAHS. First, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and serum hsCRP concentration were measured. Then, the moderate to severe OSAHS group was further divided into a conservative treatment subgroup (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>68) and a CPAP subgroup (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>68). After 6 months of treatment, MoCA scores and hsCRP concentrations were re-measured in the moderate to severe group.RESULTS: Compared with the absent or mild OSAHS group, hsCRP concentration was higher (1.00<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.28 mg/L versus 2.71<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.8, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) and MoCA scores were significantly lower (27.4<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.4 versus 26.3<U+2009>±<U+2009>2.0, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) in the moderate to severe group. After adjustment for age, education, body mass index, and neck circumference, hsCRP and MoCA scores correlated with parameters of overnight hypoxia. hsCRP and the proportion of time spent with blood oxygen saturation<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>90 % (T90) predicted MoCA score. hsCRP and MoCA score improved, and the subdomains of the MoCA were partially improved, in the CPAP treatment subgroup. In conservatively managed patients, hsCRP concentration increased, and there was no improvement in neurocognitive dysfunction, with the memory subdomain significantly worse.CONCLUSIONS: hsCRP may play a role in neurocognitive dysfunction in OSAHS. Long-term CPAP treatment could normalize the serum hsCRP concentration and partially reverse cognitive dysfunction in OSAHS."

This study aimed to explore the relationship between MetS and cognitive performance among Chinese elderly population.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed, with data collected in seven clinical centers from five provinces of Northern China. All recruited participants were =50 years of age and complained with cognitive impairment or were reported with cognitive impairment by his/her caregiver(s). MetS was diagnosed according to the criteria issued by Chinese Medical Association Diabetes Association. Cognitive function was scored by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).RESULTS: Three thousand nine hundred eighty-eight participants (in an average of 66.4<U+2009>±<U+2009>8.8 years of age, male 53.1%) were included in the analysis. Six hundred seventy-three (16.9%) participants were diagnosed with MetS, and 3013 (75.6%) participants had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (MoCA score &lt;26). There was no statistically significant difference in the MoCA scores between participants with MetS (21.0<U+2009>±<U+2009>5.4) and without MetS (21.3<U+2009>±<U+2009>5.3). In the logistic regression, after adjusting factors of age, education, marital status, smoking, and physical activity, diabetes and dyslipidemia were associated with MCI, whereas hypertension and overweight or obesity were not. Participants with diabetes had a higher risk of MCI (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.24, 95% CI: 1.03-1.50). Participants with dyslipidemia had a lower risk of MCI (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.81, 95% CI: 0.68-0.97).CONCLUSION: In our study, MetS is not associated with cognitive performance in elderly Chinese population. However, elderly Chinese with diabetes would have lower cognition function, and the dyslipidemia might be reversely associated with the cognitive function."

"26923521","Olfactory impairment predicts cognitive decline in early Parkinson's disease.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between baseline olfaction and both cross-sectional and longitudinal cognitive assessments, motor symptoms, non-motor symptoms (NMS), and CSF biomarkers in early Parkinson's disease (PD).METHODS: Parkinson's Progression Marker's Initiative (PPMI) participants underwent baseline olfactory testing with the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). Serial assessments included measures of motor symptoms, NMS, neuropsychological assessment, and CSF biomarkers. Up to three years follow-up data were included.RESULTS: At baseline, worse olfaction (lowest tertile) was associated with more severe NMS, including anxiety and autonomic symptoms. Those in the lowest olfactory tertile were more likely to report cognitive impairment (37.4%) compared to those in the middle (24.4%) and highest olfactory tertiles (14.2%, p &lt; 0.001). Aß1-42 was significantly lower, and tau/Aß1-42 ratio was higher in those with worse olfaction. In longitudinal analyses, lower UPSIT score was associated with greater decline in MoCA score (ß = 0.02 [0.01, 0.03], p = 0.001) over time, as were composite measures of UPSIT score and either Aß1-42 or tau/Aß1-42 ratio. In a Cox proportional hazards model, a composite measure of olfaction and Aß1-42 was a significant predictor of conversion from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI; i.e., MoCA &lt; 26), with subjects most impaired on both measures being 87% more likely to develop incident MCI (HR = 1.87 [1.16, 3.01], p = 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Worse baseline olfaction is associated with long-term cognitive decline. The addition of AD CSF biomarkers to olfactory testing may increase the likelihood of identifying those at highest risk for cognitive decline and progression to MCI."
"26903584","Validating a Pragmatic Approach to Cognitive Screening in Stroke Prevention Clinics Using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is used commonly to identify cognitive impairment (CI), but there are multiple published cut points for normal and abnormal. We seek to validate a pragmatic approach to screening for moderate-severe CI, by classifying patients into high-, intermediate-, and low-risk categories.METHODS: A total of 390 participants attending an academic Stroke Prevention Clinic completed the MoCA and more detailed neuropsychological testing. Between April 23, 2012 and April 30, 2014, all consecutive new referrals to the regional Stroke Prevention Clinic who were English-speaking, not severely aphasic, and could see and write well enough to complete neuropsychological testing were assessed for inclusion, and consenting patients were enrolled. CI was defined as =2 SDs below normal for age and education on at least 2 cognitive subtests. A single cut point for CI was compared with 2 cut points (high sensitivity and high specificity) generated using receiver operator characteristic and area under the curve analyses. The intermediate-risk group contained those scoring between the 2 cut points.RESULTS: Thirty-four percent of participants had a symptomatic or silent stroke, 34% were seen for possible or probable transient ischemic attack, and 32% were diagnosed with other vascular or nonvascular conditions. Using a single cut point, sensitivity and specificity were optimal with MoCA =22, (sensitivity=60.4%, specificity=89.9%, area under the curve=0.801, positive predictive value=48.5%, negative predictive value=93.5%, positive likelihood ratio=6, and negative likelihood ratio=0.4). Using 2 cut points, sensitivity was optimal with MoCA =28 (sensitivity=96.2%, negative predictive value =97.6%, and negative likelihood ratio=1.27), and specificity was optimal with MoCA =22 (specificity=89.9%, positive predictive value=48.5%, and positive likelihood ratio=6).CONCLUSIONS: Stratifying participants into 3 categories facilitates the identification of a homogenous group at low risk for CI, as well as 2 other groups with intermediate and higher risk. This approach could facilitate clinical care pathways and patient selection for research."

"26880907","Subjective Memory Complaint and Depressive Symptoms among Older Adults in Portugal.","Background. Older adults report subjective memory complaints (SMCs) but whether these are related to depression remains controversial. In this study we investigated the relationship between the SMCs and depression and their predictors in a sample of old adults. Methods. This cross-sectional study enrolled 620 participants aged 55 to 96 years (74.04 ± 10.41). Outcome measures included a sociodemographic and clinical questionnaire, a SMC scale (QSM), a Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), a Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), and a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Results. The QSM mean total score for the main results suggests that SMCs are higher in old adults with depressed symptoms, comparatively to nondepressed old adults. The GDS scores were positively associated with QSM but negatively associated with education, MMSE, and MoCA. GDS scores predicted almost 63.4% of variance. Scores on QSM and MoCA are significantly predicted by depression symptomatology. Conclusion. Depression symptoms, lower education level, and older age may be crucial to the comprehension of SMCs. The present study suggested that depression might play a role in the SMCs of the older adults and its treatment should be considered. "
"26861463","Research consent capacity varies with executive function and memory in Parkinson's disease.","BACKGROUND: We examined the association between cognitive domains and research consent capacity in PD. Our hypothesis was that research consent capacity is best predicted by executive function.METHODS: A cohort of 90 PD patients and 30 healthy older adults were administered the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Clinical Research, Dementia Rating Scale-2, and the MoCA. Experts classified patients as either &quot;capable&quot; or &quot;not capable&quot; of providing informed consent to participate in two clinical trials.RESULTS: MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Clinical Research Reasoning scores for both clinical trial types were most associated with executive functions and delayed recall. As scores on these domains improved, the odds of an expert rating of &quot;capable of consent&quot; increased.CONCLUSIONS: These results extend our previous findings by demonstrating that memory and executive abilities appear closely associated with capacity when evaluated using either a structured interview or expert judgment of that interview."

No research is available to examine cognitive rehabilitation practices applied to individuals with neurological conditions in Kuwait.OBJECTIVES: To identify the use of cognitive assessments, the availability of resources, and the barriers to cognitive rehabilitation practices in Kuwait. Methods Face-to-face interviews were conducted with health care professionals working with adult individuals with neurological conditions. These professionals included occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, psychiatrists, and neurologists. Results The most commonly used cognitive based assessments are MMSE (41%), and MoCA and LOTCA (15.2%). The only clinical assessment used is the Line-Bisection Test (2.2%). The most used occupation-based assessments are FIM (6.5%), COPM (4.3%), the Interest Checklist (2.2%), and the Barthel Index (2.2%). Resources related to cognitive rehabilitation in Kuwait that are unavailable to practitioners include journal clubs (91%), special interest groups (89%), and continuing education programmes (82.6%). Barriers to cognitive rehabilitation practice included lack of sufficient funds for continuing education, lack of time, lack of standardized assessments, and lack of inter-professional teamwork. Conclusion Many adults in Kuwait live with cognitive impairment. There is a need to develop appropriate evidence-based cognitive rehabilitation clinical guidelines in Kuwait."

The two groups were matched for age, sex, education, and vascular risk factors. All the subjects underwent the scans of conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), DTI and neuropsychological assessment. The values of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured within white matter lesions (WML) and normal appearing white matter (NAWM). Three regions of interest (ROIs) were located in the white matter of centrum semiovale, anterior periventricular white matter and posterior periventricular white matter. The relationships between the cognitive function and the abnormalities of DTI parameters were analyzed.RESULTS: (1) Patients with LA performed significantly worse cognitive function, especially in the fields of executive function. The results of our study showed that patients with LA were associated with comprehensive cognitive function deficits, including mini mental state examination (MMSE) (24.4 ± 3.2 vs 28.3 ± 1.2), montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) (21.2 ± 3.4 vs 25.7 ± 1.7), Stroop B (69.2 ± 13.5 vs 43.3 ± 5.0), Stroop C (141.2 ± 42.6 vs 64. 8 ± 10.0), Stroop (C-B) (72.0 ± 41.9 vs 21.5 ± 9.4), trail making test (TMT)-A (73.4 ± 15.4 vs 31.1 ± 7.1), TMT-B (126.2 ± 17.5 vs 81.4 ± 5.7), digit symbol test (25.2 ± 5 .4 vs 36.7 ± 5.1) (all P&lt;0.05). (2) The values of FA were lower, and MD were higher in WML than NAWM and controls in all the three ROIs (P&lt;0.05). The values of FA in NAWM located in centrum semiovale and posterior periventricular white matter were lower than controls (P&lt;0.05). The values of MD in NAWM located in anterior periventricular white matter were higher than controls (P&lt;0.05). (3) The values of FA of NAWM located in anterior periventricular correlated inversely with the Z scores of executive function (r=-0.311, P=0.04).CONCLUSIONS: Patients with LA are related with significant cognitive impairment, especially in the domains of executive dysfunction. Microstructural integrity of both white matter lesions and NAWM is associated with executive function. The underlying executive dysfunction in LA may attribute to the damage of the prefrontal-subcortical circle."
"26812976","[Study on changes of plasma levels of oxidative stress biomarkers and its relation with cognition function in patients with parkinson's disease].","OBJECTIVE: To study the changes of plasma levels of oxidative stress biomarkers in patients with parkinson's disease (PD), and to explore its association with cognition function.METHODS: Seventy-two PD patients from June 2013 to May 2012 were enrolled. All of them were outpatients or inpatients at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. And forty-five age- and gender- matched healthy subjects were used as controls. The information including gender, age, illness duration, years of education and Hoehn &amp; Yahr (H-Y) stage were recorded. Cognition function of all the patients with PD and the controls were measured by using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale. Plasma levels of catalase (CAT), total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), total glutathione (T-GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured by ELISA . Then we compared and analyzed the results.RESULTS: Plasma levels of CAT, T-SOD and T-GSH in PD group were significantly lower than the control group [(159 ± 9) kU/L vs (170 ± 5) kU/L, P&lt; 0.01; (97 ± 24) kU/L vs (124 ± 25) kU/L, P&lt;0.01; (17 ± 10) µmol/L vs (60 ± 51) µmol/L, P&lt; 0.01]. Plasma levels of CAT, T-GSH, GSH-Px and MDA were no differences between early PD group (H-Y stage I-II) and middle-late PD group (H-Y stage III or higher) of patients (P&gt;0.05). Plasma levels of T-GSH in PD group with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were obviously lower than PD group without MCI [(14 ± 7) µmol/L vs (19 ± 11) µmol/L, P&lt; 0.05]. In PD patients, MoCA scores were positively correlated with years of education (ß=0.634, P= 0.000) and plasma levels of T-GSH (ß= 0.204, P= 0.014), and were negatively correlated with H-Y stage (ß=-0.194, P=0.020).CONCLUSIONS: The damage of plasma antioxidant mechanism may be involved in the pathogenesis of patients with PD. Decrease in plasma levels of T-GSH may be associated with MCI in PD patients . Plasma levels of T-GSH may be a potential early predictive index in PD patients with cognitive dysfunction."

The present study investigates that whether miR-132 is altered in circulating blood serum samples of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) patients.METHODS: We collected samples from 39 subjects with PSCI, 37 subjects with post-stroke cognitive normality (PSCN), and 38 age-matched controls (AMC) for which ages, gender and education level were matched. MiR-132 was detected using a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method. To test the predictive value of miR-132 for PSCI, prediction capabilities were compared using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under curve (AUC) analysis.RESULTS: The level of miR-132 in PSCI patient serum was significantly elevated compared to that of PSCN and AMC subjects. The ROC curve showed that miR-132 achieved an AUC of 0.961 (p&lt;0.0001). Importantly, the miR-132 level was correlated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score in PSCI patients.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that there was a substantial correlation between serum miR-132 expression and post-stroke cognitive functionality, suggesting that miR-132 may be a risk marker for PSCI. Because of the limitations of this study, the results should be treated with caution."

"26727602","Application and Revision of Montreal Cognitive Assessment in China's Military Retirees with Mild Cognitive Impairment.","OBJECTIVE: In an effort to accommodate MOCA to better fit for the Chinese context, this study was designed to employ the MOCA criteria to screen mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and analyze associated risk factors in military retirees.METHODS: Three hundred and four retired military cadres were recruited using a random cluster sampling technique with information collected including personal, prevalence, MOCA scale, and related neuropsychiatry scale. Thirty retirees were randomly chosen to be further analyzed one month later using the revised MOCA scale.RESULTS: <U+2460>Our data indicated an incidence rate of 64.8% for mild cognitive impairment in retired military cadres. The incidence rate for MCI was significantly higher in those aged 80 or above compared with those 80 years of age or younger (P&lt;0.05). The incidence rate of MCI was significantly higher in those with fewer than 6 years of education compared with those with over 7 years of education (P&lt;0.05). The MCI incidence was higher for those with little exercise than those taking regular exercise (P&lt;0.01). Moreover, the MCI incidence was higher in stroke patients than those who never had a stroke episode (P&lt;0.05). <U+2461>There was a significant correlation between MOCA and MMSE scale scores (r = 0.81). MOCA scale scores were negatively correlated with ADL and CES-D scores (although not PSQI scores). <U+2462> MOCA recension Cronbach's alpha value was 0.862. The related coefficient of MOCA and MOCA recension was 0.878(P&lt;0.01). When the Score of cut-off -point of the MOCA recension was 28, the area in ROC curve analyses was 0.859, as well as the largest area.CONCLUSION: Retired cadres exhibited a greater incidence of MCI (than general population), which was closely associated with age, level of education and physical exercise and cerebral apoplexy. Revised MOCA scale displays a better validity and reaction degree of reliability and is more suitable for screening and diagnosis of MCI in the elderly in China."

Patients with first-time anterior circulation TIA (diagnosed within 24 h of onset) and normal cognition, treated between August 2009 and August 2014 at the Department of Neurology of Chengdu Military General Hospital, China, were analyzed retrospectively. Patients underwent whole-brain CTPI within 1 week of TIA to detect cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean transit time (MTT) and time to peak (TTP) in the ischemic region. Based on cognitive function assessment 4 weeks after TIA, using the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and mini mental state examination, the patients were divided into control and VCI groups. CTPI parameters and other clinical data were compared between groups, and Spearman's correlation analysis used to identify associations between cognitive scores and CTPI parameters in the VCI group. 50 patients (25 per group; aged 55-72 years) were included. Patient age, gender, smoking status, alcohol consumption, educational level, time from TIA onset to admission, time from TIA onset to CTPI, and prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation and hyperhomocysteinemia did not differ between groups. Both groups showed TTP and MTT prolongation, CBF reduction, but no change in CBV in the ischemic region; these changes were significantly larger in the VCI group (P &lt; 0.05). MTT correlated negatively with MoCA score (r = -0.51, P = 0.009). CTPI could facilitate early diagnosis of VCI in patients with anterior circulation TIA. "

According to the evaluation results of MCI, these T2DM patients were further divided into the T2DM + MCI group (n = 138) and the T2DM + NMCI group (n = 122). General data, including gender, age, disease history and body mass index (BMI), and the laboratory indexes, including serum adiponectin, fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and blood fat, were collected for statistical analysis in T2DM + MCI group, T2DM + NMCI group and healthy control group.RESULTS: Comparisons among T2DM + MCI group, T2DM + NMCI group and healthy control group, showed that the serum level of adiponectin in T2DM + MCI group was significantly lower than those in remaining two groups (p &lt; 0.01). Spearman correlation analysis revealed that score of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was positively correlated with the serum level of adiponectin (r = 0.446, p &lt; 0.01). Multivariate linear regression analysis indicated that education (standard ß = 0.325, p = 0.003), age (standard ß = -0.236, p = 0.016), disease course of hypertension (standard ß = -0.242, p = 0.006), disease course of diabetes mellitus (standard ß = -0.377, p &lt; 0.001) and the level of adiponectin were correlated with the cognitive impairment. The results of itemized assessment in MoCA scale showed that in T2DM + MCI group, the scores in visuospatial and executive abilities, attention, language and orientation were significantly lower than those in other two groups (p &lt; 0.01). As for the delayed recall, the score in T2DM + MCI group was significantly lower than those in other two groups (p &lt; 0.01), while the score in T2DM + NMCI group was lower than that in the healthy control group (p &lt; 0.01); in terms of the naming ability and abstraction, no statistically significant differences were identified among three groups (p &gt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Age, poor education, disease course of hypertension, disease course of diabetes mellitus and a low level of adiponectin in serum are the risk factors in MCI of T2DM patients. Besides, the level of adiponectin in serum of T2DM patients is correlated with the development of MCI; elderly T2DM patients are afflicted by cognitive impairment, mainly in visuospatial and executive abilities, attention, language, delayed recall and orientation."

"29227264","CHARACTERISTICS OF CHANGES IN COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS OF THE PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSIVE DISEASE.","Decline of the cognitive functions is one of the modern medicine actual problem. The influence of hypertension as modifiable risk factor in the evolution of cognitive impairment is emphasized in numerous investigations. Almost all the proposed in research literature data were obtained from the investigation of old patients group, who had high indexes of blood pressure and stroke histories. Therefore, we think that it is very impotent to detect the slight and moderate cognitive impairment of hypertensive patients of working age until the expressed clinical signs appear. Objective - determine the age and hypertension duration influence on the evolution of cognitive impairments in patients with essential hypertension of the second stage. There were examined 102 patients with essential hypertension of the second stage, which had not any attendant illnesses. Their average years were about 49,84±0,83 average. Disease duration was approximately 8,78±0,60. According to the purpose of examination all patients were divided by age and disease duration into 3 groups. To study cognitive impairment used a number of neuropsychological tests. Analyzing the MoCA test data of examined patients it should be noted a tendency to decreasing of cognitive function indexes with age increasing. Thus, the patients of the first group have no cognitive impairment. But authentic lowering of MoCA test results may be noted in the patients group of 56 years and higher, up to 6,1% in comparison with the patients under 45 years. The indexes of MoCA test in the group of patients with arterial hypertension duration more than 10 years were authentically lower comparing with the group of patients with disease duration up to 5 years and patients with arterial hypertension duration of 5 to 10 years in 9,9% and in 4,9% accordantly. We have found that with increasing duration of the disease and age the working age patients with essential hypertension of the second stage, significant increase in cognitive impairment was observed. Diagnosing of cognitive impairment is the measure of prevention of dementia in future and it must be an inseparable part of system examination of hypertensive patients."

Due to the magnitude of the HIV-positive population in Sub-Saharan Africa, easy-to-use cognitive screening tools are essential.METHODS: This was a cross-sectional clinical trial involving 44 HIV-positive patients (on stable cART) and 73 HIV-negative controls completing an NPA, the International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS), and a culturally appropriate cognitive screening tool, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Basic (MoCA-B). HAND were diagnosed by calculating Z-scores using internationally published normative data on NPA, as well as by using data from the HIV-negative group to validate the MoCA-B.RESULTS: One hundred and seventeen patients were included (25% male, median age 35 years, median 11 years of education). A moderate correlation was found between the MoCA-B and NPA total Z-score (Pearson's r=0.36, p=0.02). Area under the curve (AUC) values for MoCA-B and IHDS were 0.59 and 0.70, respectively. The prevalence of HAND in HIV-positive patients was 66% when calculating Z-scores using published normative data versus 48% when using the data from the present HIV-negative cohort.CONCLUSION: The MoCA-B appeared not to be a valid screening tool for HAND in this setting. The prevalence of HAND in this setting is high, but appeared overestimated when using published norms."

We aimed to evaluate the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in Turkish migrants in Berlin and its association with demographics and health-related variables.METHOD: For this cross-sectional study, a random sample of persons with Turkish names was drawn from the registration-office. Cognitive function was assessed using the MoCA; 0 = worst, 30 = best total score. Multivariable linear regression models were calculated to determine associated factors with the total MoCA-score.RESULTS: In our analyses we included 282 participants (50% female), mean age 42.3 ± 11.9 years (mean ± standard deviation (SD)). The mean ± SD MoCA score was 23.3 ± 4.3. In the multivariable analysis, higher education (ß = 2.68; p &lt; 0.001), and chosing the German version of the MoCA (ß = -1.13; p = 0.026), were associated with higher MoCA-scores, whereas higher age (ß = -0.08; p = 0.002) was associated with lower MoCA scores.CONCLUSION: In our study, a higher educational level, lower age, and German as the preferred test language (as compared to Turkish) were positively associated with the cognitive performance of Berliners with Turkish roots. To examine neurocognitive health of migrants, longitudinal population-based and clinical cohort studies that specifically compare migrants and their descendants with the original population of their home countries are required."
"29134611","Exploring white matter microstructure and olfaction dysfunction in early parkinson disease: diffusion MRI reveals new insight.","Olfaction dysfunction is considered as a robust marker of prodromal Parkinson disease (PD). Measurement of olfaction function as a screening test is unsatisfactory due to long lead time interval and low specificity for detection of PD. Use of imaging markers might yield more accurate predictive values and provide bases for combined use of imaging and clinical markers for early PD. Diffusion MRI connectometry was conducted on 85 de novo PD patients in and 36 healthy controls to find: first, white matter tracts with significant difference in quantitative anisotropy between PD groups with various degrees of olfaction dysfunction and second, second fibers with correlation with University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) score in each group using a multiple regression analysis considering age, sex, GDS and MoCA score. Local connectomes were determined in seven of all the possible comparisons, correcting for false discovery rate (FDR). PD patients with anosmia and normal olfaction had the highest number of fibers with decreased connectivity in left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, bilateral fornix, bilateral middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), bilateral cingulum, bilateral corticospinal tract (CST) and body, genu and splenium of corpus callosum (CC) (FDR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0013). In multiple regression analysis, connectivity in the body, genu and splenium of CC and bilateral fornix had significant negative correlation (FDR between 0.019 and 0.083), and bilateral cingulum and MCP had significant positive correlation (FDR between 0.022 and 0.092) with UPSIT score. White matter connectivity in healthy controls could not be predicted by UPSIT score using the same model. The results of this study provide compelling evidence that microstructural degenerative changes in these areas underlie the clinical phenotype of prodromal olfaction dysfunction in PD and that diffusion parameters of these areas might be able to serve as signature markers for early detection of PD. This is the first report that confirms a discriminative role for UPSIT score in identifying PD specific changes in white matter microstructure. Our results open a window to identify microstructural signatures of prodromal PD in white matter."
"29120490","Determination of MoCA Cutoff Score in Patients with Alcohol Use Disorders.","BACKGROUND: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score is a convenient and promising tool for estimating alcoholic patients' global cognitive functioning, a major challenge for all specialized alcohol treatment centers. However, whether or not the score should be corrected for education level and whether the proposed cutoff is relevant in patients with alcohol use disorders (AUD) should be determined.METHODS: We compared the MoCA scores in patients hospitalized for AUD with and without cognitive impairment assessed by a battery of neuropsychological (NP) tests. Sensitivity, specificity, and cutoff of the MoCA score were analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with and 25 without cognitive impairment were included in the study. There were 40 men and 16 women, with a mean age of 49.5 years. The mean uncorrected MoCA score was 23.1 ± 3.3 in those with and 27.0 ± 1.9 in those without cognitive impairment. NP tests were significantly correlated with the MoCA score. Uncorrected MoCA scores identified more than 80% of the patients with a cutoff score equal to 26, to obtain similar accuracy with the corrected score required using a cutoff score equal to 27.CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that the MoCA test is a convenient and reliable screening tool to measure cognition defects in alcoholic patients. As using the 1-point education adjustment increases the cutoff score by 1 point, it is suggested to use the noncorrected score and the usual cutoff, that is, 26. Being easy to administer and only moderately time-consuming, the MoCA score should be used extensively in addiction treatment centers."

"29112532","Speech in Noise Perception as a Marker of Cognitive Impairment in HIV Infection.","OBJECTIVES: Human immunodeficiency virus positive (HIV+) individuals report hearing difficulties, but standard audiological tests show no, or small, changes in peripheral hearing ability. The hearing complaints may reflect central nervous system (CNS) auditory processing deficits, rather than middle or inner ear problems, and may result from CNS damage due to HIV infection or treatment. If central auditory task performance and cognitive deficits in HIV+ individuals are shown to be related, then central auditory tests might serve as a &quot;window&quot; into CNS function in these patients.DESIGN: We measured cognitive performance (Mandarin Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]) and speech in noise perception (Mandarin hearing-in-noise test [HINT]) in 166 normal-hearing HIV+ individuals (158 men, 8 women, average age 36 years) at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center in Shanghai, China. Data collection included audiometry, tympanometry, and the Amsterdam Inventory of Auditory Handicap (AIAH), which assesses the subjective ability to understand speech and localize sound.RESULTS: Subjects had no middle ear disease and met criteria for normal-hearing sensitivity (all thresholds 20 dB HL or less). A significant negative relationship between speech reception thresholds (SRT) and MoCA scores (r = 0.15, F = 28.2, p &lt; 0.001) existed. Stepwise linear regression showed that when the factors of age, MoCA scores, hearing thresholds, and education level were considered, only age and MoCA scores contributed independently to the SRT results (overall model r = 0.30, F = 38.8, p &lt; 0.001). Subjective hearing complaints from the AIAH supported the HINT results. AIAH and MoCA scores were also related (r = 0.05, F = 8.5, p = 0.004), with those with worse MoCA scores having more problems on the AIAH. When the cohort was divided into those with normal and abnormal performance on the MoCA, those with abnormal performance on the MoCA had significantly higher average SRTs (p &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Understanding speech in noise measured both objectively with the HINT and subjectively with the AIAH was inversely related to cognitive abilities despite a normal ability to hear soft sounds determined by audiometry. Although age was also an important independent factor affecting speech perception, the age relationship within the speech findings in this study may represent more than just age-related declines in speech in noise understanding. Although reliable data on disease duration are not available, the older members of this cohort likely had HIV longer and probably had more severe symptoms at presentation than the younger members because early detection and treatment of HIV in Shanghai has improved over time. Therefore, the age relationship may also include elements of disease duration and severity. Speech perception, especially in challenging listening conditions, involves cortical and subcortical centers and is a demanding neurological task. The problems interpreting speech in noise HIV+ individuals have may reflect HIV-related or HIV treatment-related, central nervous damage, suggesting that CNS complications in HIV+ individuals could potentially be diagnosed and monitored using central auditory tests."
"29111025","Orthostatic hypotension associated with executive dysfunction in mild cognitive impairment.","INTRODUCTION: Midlife hypertension is associated with dementia in longitudinal studies while chronic hypotension in the elderly is associated with dementia onset. Orthostatic hypotension could influence cognitive performance in the elderly. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between orthostatic hypotension and cognitive functions.METHODS: Consecutive participants with complete neuropsychological evaluation from a Memory Clinic were included. Orthostatic hypotension (OH) was defined by a fall=20/10mmHg systolic/diastolic pressure. Participants were classified into one of 3 groups: 1) subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), 2) mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 3) dementia. Neuropsychological tests were analyzed for patients with and without OH.RESULTS: One hundred and twenty participants were included, of which 16 (13%) were classified as SCI, 42 (35%) as MCI, and 63 (52%) with dementia. Prevalence of OH was 0% for the SCI group, 26% (n=11) for the MCI group, and 38% (n=24) for the dementia group. Age, sex, education, and brief cognitive test scores (MMSE &amp; MoCA) were not different between groups with or without OH. In the MCI group, OH was associated with lower cognitive performance in several executive functions tests: visual working memory (p&lt;0.001), processing speed (p=0.006), Stroop flexibility (p=0.030) and Trail-Making Test part B (p=0.024). There was no difference in episodic memory performance. OH was associated with a diagnosis of hypertension and the use of antihypertensive medication. No differences were observed in vascular brain injury between groups with and without OH.CONCLUSIONS: This study found that orthostatic hypotension prevalence is correlated to severity of cognitive deficits in a Memory Clinic. In MCI, OH is associated with lower performance in executive functions. OH could represent an under-recognized correlate of cognitive performance."

"29058572","Lifetime marijuana and alcohol use, and cognitive dysfunction in people with human immunodeficiency virus infection.","BACKGROUND: Substance use is common among people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Alcohol, marijuana, and HIV can have negative effects on cognition. Associations between current and lifetime marijuana and alcohol use and cognitive dysfunction in people with HIV infection were examined.METHODS: Some 215 HIV-infected adults with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) substance dependence or ever injection drug use were studied. In adjusted cross-sectional regression analyses associations were assessed between current marijuana use, current heavy alcohol use, lifetime marijuana use, lifetime alcohol use, duration of heavy alcohol use (the independent variables), and 3 measures of cognitive dysfunction (dependent variables): both the (i) memory and (ii) attention domains from the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the (iii) 4-item cognitive function scale (CF4) from the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV). Analyses were adjusted for demographics, primary language, depressive symptoms, anxiety, comorbidities, antiretroviral therapy, hepatitis C virus (ever), duration of HIV infection (years), HIV-viral load (log copies/mL), CD4 cell count, lifetime and recent cocaine use, and recent illicit and prescribed opioid use.RESULTS: Current marijuana use was significantly and negatively associated with the MOS-HIV CF4 score (adjusted mean difference = -0.40, P = .01). Current marijuana use was not significantly associated with either MoCA score. Lifetime marijuana use and current heavy and lifetime alcohol use and duration of heavy alcohol use were not associated with any measure of cognitive dysfunction.CONCLUSION: Current marijuana use was associated with one measure of cognitive dysfunction, but there was not a consistent pattern of association with lifetime marijuana use or alcohol use and measures of cognitive dysfunction. Understanding the mechanism by which marijuana, with and without alcohol, are associated with worse cognition warrants larger, longer studies with more precise and diverse measurements of cognitive function."
"29026292","The effects of holistic health group interventions on improving the cognitive ability of persons with mild cognitive impairment: a randomized controlled trial.","PURPOSE: Persons with mild cognitive impairment (PwMCI) are at a higher risk of developing dementia than those without cognitive impairment. This research study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a holistic health group intervention, which is based on the holistic brain health approach as well as an Eastern approach to health care, on improving the cognitive ability of Chinese PwMCI.RESEARCH METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), 38 Chinese PwMCI were randomly assigned to either a 10-session holistic health intervention group or the control group. The holistic health treatment group attempted to promote the acceptance of their illness, enhance memory and coping skills, develop a positive lifestyle, maintain positive emotions, and facilitate emotional support among participants. The 10-session holistic health group intervention was structured, with each session conducted once per week and ~90 minutes in length. Control group patients and their family caregivers received standardized basic educational materials that provided basic information on cognitive decline for them to read at home. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test was used to assess the cognitive ability of PwMCI in the pre- and posttreatment periods by a research assistant who was blind to the group assignment of the participants.CONCLUSION: This present RCT provides evidence to support the feasibility and effectiveness of the holistic health group intervention in improving the cognitive and short-term memory abilities of PwMCI."
"28953682","Potential contribution of the neurodegenerative disorders risk loci to cognitive performance in an elderly male gout population.","Cognitive impairment has been described in elderly subjects with high normal concentrations of serum uric acid. However, it remains unclear if gout confers an increased poorer cognition than those in individuals with asymptomatic hyperuricemia. The present study aimed at evaluating cognitive function in patients suffering from gout in an elderly male population, and further investigating the genetic contributions to the risk of cognitive function.This study examined the cognitive function as assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in 205 male gout patients and 204 controls. The genetic basis of these cognitive measures was evaluated by genome-wide association study (GWAS) data in 102 male gout patients. Furthermore, 7 loci associated with cognition in GWAS were studied for correlation with gout in 1179 male gout patients and 1848 healthy male controls.Compared with controls, gout patients had significantly lower MoCA scores [22.78<U+200A>±<U+200A>3.01 vs 23.42<U+200A>±<U+200A>2.95, P<U+200A>=<U+200A>.023, adjusted by age, body mass index (BMI), education, and emotional disorder]. GWAS revealed 7 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associations with MoCA test at a level of conventional genome-wide significance (P<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>9.6<U+200A>×<U+200A>10). The most significant association was observed between rs12895072 and rs12434554 within the KTN1 gene (Padjusted<U+200A>=<U+200A>4.2<U+200A>×<U+200A>10, Padjusted<U+200A>=<U+200A>4.7<U+200A>×<U+200A>10) at 14q22. The next best signal was in RELN gene (rs155333, Padjusted<U+200A>=<U+200A>1.3<U+200A>×<U+200A>10) at 7q22, while the other variants at rs17458357 (Padjusted<U+200A>=<U+200A>3.98<U+200A>×<U+200A>10), rs2572683 (Padjusted<U+200A>=<U+200A>8.9<U+200A>×<U+200A>10), rs12555895 (Padjusted<U+200A>=<U+200A>2.6<U+200A>×<U+200A>10), and rs3764030 (Padjusted<U+200A>=<U+200A>9.4<U+200A>×<U+200A>10) were also statistically significant. The 7 SNPs were not associated with gout in further analysis (all P<U+200A>&gt;<U+200A>.05).Elderly male subjects with gout exhibit accelerated decline in cognition performance. Several neurodegenerative disorders risk loci were identified for genetic contributors to cognitive performance in our Chinese elderly male gout population. Larger prospective studies of the cognitive performance and genetic analysis in gout subjects are recommended."

We aim to evaluate associations between inflammatory markers and the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in T2DM. This study of 140 diabetic patients involved 71 with MCI and 69 controls. Clinical parameters, neuropsychological tests, high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), lipoprotein-associated Phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) mass and activity were measured. The results showed significantly higher plasma hsCRP, IL-6, Lp-PLA2 mass and activity in MCI group compared to controls. In T2DM with MCI, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score was positively correlated with education level and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), but inversely correlated with age, glycosylated hemoglobin, intima-media thickness (IMT), hsCRP, IL-6, and Lp-PLA2 mass and activity. Correlation analysis showed that both plasma Lp-PLA2 mass and activity were positively correlated with total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and IMT but negatively associated with MoCA score. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated higher hsCRP, Lp-PLA2 mass, Lp-PLA2 activity, and lower HDL-c to be independent risk factors increasing the possibility of MCI in T2DM. In conclusion, plasma Lp-PLA2 and hsCRP were found to be associated with the risk of MCI among T2DM patients."

The activities of daily living (ADL), global deterioration scale (GDS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA), patient-generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA), and mini nutritional assessment (MNA) were performed to analyze the differences between the 2 groups. Logistic regression analysis was conducted for risk factors of CI in elderly patients with chronic diseases. RESULTS There were differences in age, education level, type 2 diabetes mellitus, multifocal cerebral infarction, hearing, and eyesight between CI and normal groups. Patients in the CI group showed more CD4+ cells, more admission times, and higher GDS scores than the normal group. Also, MMSE and MoCA scores revealed differences in total score, directive force, attention and calculating ability, language, delayed memory, reading comprehension, writing, and visual-spatial ability between the 2 groups. The number of B and CD8+ cells, ADL, and MNA scores were protective factors, while cerebral infarction history, number of CD4+ cells, admission times, GDS score, and age were risk factors of CI in elderly patients with chronic diseases. CONCLUSIONS Our study provides evidence that cerebral infarction history, number of CD4+ cells, admission times, GDS score, and age are risk factors of CI in elderly patients with chronic diseases."

"28886902","Measuring stability of cognitive impairment in inpatients with schizophrenia with alternate forms of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment during acute hospitalization.","Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia. Measuring the stability of cognitive impairment is important for further understanding of this disorder. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has been demonstrated to be a brief and effective screening tool in detecting cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia. It has alternative versions designed for longitudinal settings. The current study retrospectively analyzed the total and subscores of two versions of the MoCA, administered to a group of inpatients with severe schizophrenia at admission and discharge, to measure their cognitive stability during hospitalization. The results revealed that the test-retest reliability coefficient of the MoCA had good reliability, suggesting the two alternative versions of the MoCA are reliable measurements for assessing cognitive impairment repeatedly in patients with schizophrenia. The paired-samples t-test showed that the overall cognitive impairment of patients measured by two forms of the MoCA remained stable during acute hospital stay and across symptom changes. Furthermore, the results showed that patients' cognitive stability was not related to their symptom/illness severity improvement, age, education, or length of stay."

Relations between the receptive vocabulary and cognitive functioning, and the manifestation of differences between populations of elderly people based on the primary disease is in the focus of this study.AIM: To examine receptive vocabulary and cognition of elderly people with: verified stroke, dementia, verified stroke and dementia, and without the manifested brain disease.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The sample consisted of 120 participants older than 65 years, living in an institution. A total of 26 variables was analyzed and classified into three groups: case history/anamnestic, receptive vocabulary assessment, and cognitive assessments. The interview with social workers, nurses and caregivers, as well as medical files were used to determine the anamnestic data. A Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA) was used for the assessment of cognition. In order to estimate the receptive vocabulary, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test was used.RESULTS: Mean raw score of receptive vocabulary is 161.58 (+-21:58 points). The best results for cognitive assessment subjects achieved on subscales of orientation, naming, serial subtraction, and delayed recall. Discriminative analysis showed the significant difference in the development of receptive vocabulary and cognitive functioning in relation to the primary disease of elderly people. The biggest difference was between subjects without manifested brain disease (centroid = 1.900) and subjects with dementia (centroid = -1754).CONCLUSION: There is a significant difference between elderly with stroke; dementia; stroke and dementia, and elderly people without manifested disease of the brain in the domain of receptive vocabulary and cognitive functioning.

"28864643","Performance of Screening Tests for Cognitive Impairment in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.","OBJECTIVE: There is a need for a cognitive function screening test that can be administered to patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in clinic. The objectives of this study were to determine (1) prevalence of cognitive impairment (CI) in SLE by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), in relation to the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R), and Perceived Deficits Questionnaire 5-Item (PDQ-5); and (2) associated factors with CI.METHODS: Consecutive patients followed at a single center were recruited. HVLT-R, MoCA, and MMSE were administered. Sensitivity/specificity, positive (PPV)/negative (NPV) predictive values, and positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of MoCA/MMSE were determined (compared to HVLT-R). A test on intellectual ability and questionnaires on anxiety, depression, and perceived cognitive deficits were completed. Regression analyses determined associations with CI.RESULTS: Of 98 patients, 48% had CI using MoCA and 31% using HVLT-R. Sensitivity was higher for MoCA (73%) compared to MMSE (27%), though MMSE was more specific (90%) than MoCA (63%). PPV and LR+ were similar in MoCA and MMSE (PPV: 47%, 53%; LR+: 2.0, 2.6, respectively), but NPV was higher in MoCA (84%) than MMSE (74%). PDQ-5 predicted objective CI (HVLT-R: sensitivity 100%, specificity 89%). Although CI was associated with depression in univariate analyses, it did not hold in the multivariate analysis, while longer SLE disease duration and more years of education remained significant.CONCLUSION: CI is highly prevalent and MoCA may be a useful tool to screen for CI in SLE. Patients with more years of education were less likely to have CI."
"28807493","Homocysteine and cognitive function in Parkinson's disease.","INTRODUCTION: Increased plasma homocysteine (HC) is a risk factor for dementia in the general population. Levodopa therapy causes increased plasma HC, but it remains unclear whether elevated plasma HC is associated with cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD).METHODS: The study population includes all participants in the Pacific Northwest Udall Center (PANUC) Clinical cohort at the time of the study, consisting of 294 individuals with PD who had a standardized neuropsychological assessment and plasma collection for HC measurement. We tested the hypothesis that elevated plasma HC is inversely related to cognitive function in patients with PD.RESULTS: As expected, plasma HC was positively associated with age, disease duration, disease severity, and levodopa usage, while cognitive function was associated with age, education, gender, and APOE genotype, so subsequent analyses controlled for these covariates. When plasma HC was dichotomized as normal (&lt;14 µmol/L) or elevated (=14 µmol/L), subjects with hyper-homocysteinemia had lower scores on Digit Symbol (p = 0.031), Hopkins Verbal Learning Task (HVLT) Delayed Recall (p = 0.004), and semantic verbal fluency (p = 0.049). When examined as a continuous variable, plasma HC was inversely associated with HVLT Delayed Recall (p = 0.009)) and semantic verbal fluency (p = 0.004), but was not significantly related to Digit symbol, Trail-making test, Judgment of Line Orientation, phonemic verbal fluency, MMSE, or MOCA. When analysis was restricted to non-demented subjects (n = 231), the findings were unchanged.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that plasma HC is significantly associated with some aspects of cognitive function in PD, and may represent a treatable risk factor for cognitive decline in PD."

The percentage of cognitive impairment in IIDDs patients was 24.1% by using MMSE, while the percentage was 81.9% by using MoCA. The majority of IIDDs participants had MMSE scores in the normal range. In contrast, few IIDDs participants scored in the normal range on the MoCA. Age, EDSS and depression correlated negatively with the total score of MoCA and MMSE. Years of education correlated positively with MoCA and MMSE. ADEM patients scored lower on all MoCA subtests. Prolonged latency P300 which negatively correlated with MoCA and reduced P300 amplitude which positively correlated with MoCA were detected in IIDDs patients. Thus MoCA is superior to the MMSE as a cognitive impairment scan tool and P300 is useful for detecting cogntive deficiency in chinese IIDDs."
"28731508","A re-examination of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) cutoff scores.","OBJECTIVE: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; Nasreddine et al., 2005) is a cognitive screening tool that aims to differentiate healthy cognitive aging from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Several validation studies have been conducted on the MoCA, in a variety of clinical populations. Some studies have indicated that the originally suggested cutoff score of 26/30 leads to an inflated rate of false positives, particularly for those of older age and/or lower education. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the MoCA for differentiating healthy cognitive aging from possible MCI.METHODS: Of the 304 studies identified, nine met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. These studies were assessed across a range of cutoff scores to determine the respective sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative predictive accuracies, likelihood ratios for positive and negative results, classification accuracies, and Youden indices.RESULTS: Meta-analysis revealed a cutoff score of 23/30 yielded the best diagnostic accuracy across a range of parameters.CONCLUSIONS: A MoCA cutoff score of 23, rather than the initially recommended score of 26, lowers the false positive rate and shows overall better diagnostic accuracy. We recommend the use of this cutoff score going forward. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd."

Individuals with CI and cognitively normal controls were administered the CoCoSc and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Validity of the CoCoSc was assessed based on the relationship with the MoCA using Pearson correlation. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to examine the ability of the CoCoSc to differentiate CI from controls.RESULTS: Fifty-nine individuals with CI and 101 controls were recruited. Seventy-five (46.9%) participants had =6 years of education. Performance on the CoCoSc differed between normal and CI groups in both low and high education subgroups. Total scores of the CoCoSc and MoCA were significantly correlated (r<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.71, p<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>0.001). The area under ROC was 0.78, p<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>0.001 for the CoCoSc total score in differentiating the CI group from the cognitively normal group. A cut-off of =30 on the CoCoSc was associated with a sensitivity of 0.78 and specificity of 0.69. The CoCoSc was well accepted by attendees of community social centers.CONCLUSION: The CoCoSc is a promising computerized cognitive screen for self-administration in community social centers. It is feasible for testing individuals with high or low education levels."

Most surgeons who performed fewer (&lt;10) OCA transplants per year followed the most restrictive protocol, while surgeons who performed more (&gt;20) OCA transplants per year followed the least restrictive protocol. One-third of surgeons with the most restrictive protocol were more likely to change their protocol to be less restrictive over time, while none of those with the least restrictive protocol changed their protocol over time. Fifty-five percent of surgeons permitted return to full activity at 26 weeks, while 27% of surgeons lifted restrictions at 16 weeks.CONCLUSION: Characterization of the spectrum of postoperative management practices after OCA transplantation provides a foundation for future investigations regarding patient outcomes and associated cost to establish best practice guidelines. Fundamentally, surgeons with more experience with this procedure tended to be more aggressive with their postoperative rehabilitation guidelines. Most commonly, rehabilitation provided for some degree of limited weightbearing; however, the spectrum also included immediate full weightbearing practices."
"28715595","Lifestyle, Physical Activity and Cognitive Functions: the impact on the scores of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCa).","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a rapid screening tool, including subtests to assess several cognitive domains, developed to detect MCI from normal ageing cognitive changes. Several validation and normative studies have conducted around the world considering the influences of age and education on the MoCA score, but none takes into account the lifestyle and habits. However, lifestyles, and particularly physical activity (PA) have been positively associated with both physical and mental health in elderly. The aim of the present study is to investigate the influence of regularly practiced PA on the MoCA scores in a sample of Italian healthy elderly males. For this purpose sixty-five healthy adult males, aged 65-81 years were assigned to two groups, physically active group (PAG, N=33), and sedentary group (SG, N=32), according to recommended levels of physical activity by the World Health Organization. The Italian version of MoCA was administered to each participant. Raw data were analysed by a multiple regression model in which the independent variables were PA, age and education. Results showed a highly significant influence of PA on MoCA total score and on several cognitive domain sub-scores. Furthermore, multiple regression analysis indicated a larger impact on scores by PA than both age and education. In the light of these findings, it is advisable to pay attention to the life style of subject that undergoing a neuropsychological evaluation like the MoCa and in particular the level of PA practiced, as well as age and education."
"28697562","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment: Normative Data from a Large Swedish Population-Based Cohort.","BACKGROUND: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has a high sensitivity for detecting cognitive dysfunction. Swedish normative data does not exist and international norms are often derived from populations where cognitive impairment has not been screened for and not been thoroughly assessed to exclude subjects with dementia or mild cognitive impairment.OBJECTIVE: To establish norms for MoCA and develop a regression-based norm calculator based on a large, well-examined cohort.METHODS: MoCA was administered on 860 randomly selected elderly people from a population-based cohort from the EPIC study. Cognitive dysfunction was screened for and further assessed at a memory clinic. After excluding cognitively impaired participants, normative data was derived from 758 people, aged 65-85.RESULTS: MoCA cut-offs (-1 to -2 standard deviations) for cognitive impairment ranged from &lt;25 to &lt;21 for the lowest educated and &lt;26 to &lt;24 for the highest educated, depending on age group. Significant predictors for MoCA score were age, sex and level of education.CONCLUSION: We present detailed normative MoCA data and cut-offs according to the DSM-5 criteria for cognitive impairment based on a large population-based cohort of elderly individuals, screened and thoroughly investigated to rule out cognitive impairment. Level of education, sex, and age should be taken in account when evaluating MoCA score, which is facilitated by our online regression-based calculator that provide percentile and z-score for a subject's MoCA score."
"28653212","Higher blood-brain barrier permeability is associated with higher white matter hyperintensities burden.","The pathogenesis of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) is incompletely understood but blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction may play a key role. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between BBB permeability and the severity of WMH burden. Consecutive participants without symptomatic stroke history presented for physical examination were recruited in this cross-sectional study and divided into three WMH burden groups according to total Fazekas scores. They received dynamic contrast-enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging to measure BBB permeability, and received Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). A total of 102 participants aged 49-90 years (mean age of 69.82 years) were enrolled (36 with low WMH burden, 35 with medium WMH burden, and 31 with high WMH burden). Multivariable linear regression analyses revealed that participants with higher WMH burden had significantly higher BBB leakage rate and area under the leakage curve in normal-appearing white matter, WMH, cortical gray matter, and deep gray matter (DGM) after adjustment for age, sex, and vascular risk factors. Scores on MMSE and MoCA decreased with increasing leakage rate in WMH and DGM after adjustment for age, sex, WMH burden, and education years. We found that higher BBB permeability is associated with higher WMH burden and cognitive decline. The compromised BBB integrity may be a critical contributor to the pathogenesis of WMH and part of a series of pathological processes that finally lead to cognitive impairment."
"28652967","Neural circuit of verbal humor comprehension in schizophrenia - an fMRI study.","Individuals with schizophrenia exhibit problems with understanding the figurative meaning of language. This study evaluates neural correlates of diminished humor comprehension observed in schizophrenia. The study included chronic schizophrenia (SCH) outpatients (n = 20), and sex, age and education level matched healthy controls (n = 20). The fMRI punchline based humor comprehension task consisted of 60 stories of which 20 had funny, 20 nonsensical and 20 neutral (not funny) punchlines. After the punchlines were presented, the participants were asked to indicate whether the story was comprehensible and how funny it was. Three contrasts were analyzed in both groups reflecting stages of humor processing: abstract vs neutral stories - incongruity detection; funny vs abstract - incongruity resolution and elaboration; and funny vs neutral - complete humor processing. Additionally, parametric modulation analysis was performed using both subjective ratings separately. Between-group comparisons revealed that the SCH subjects had attenuated activation in the right posterior superior temporal gyrus (BA 41) in case of irresolvable incongruity processing of nonsensical puns; in the left dorsomedial middle and superior frontal gyri (BA 8/9) in case of incongruity resolution and elaboration processing of funny puns; and in the interhemispheric dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (BA 24) in case of complete processing of funny puns. Additionally, during comprehensibility ratings the SCH group showed a suppressed activity in the left dorsomedial middle and superior frontal gyri (BA 8/9) and revealed weaker activation during funniness ratings in the left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (BA 24). Interestingly, these differences in the SCH group were accompanied behaviorally by a protraction of time in both types of rating responses and by indicating funny punchlines less comprehensible. Summarizing, our results indicate neural substrates of humor comprehension processing impairments in schizophrenia, which is accompanied by fronto-temporal hypoactivation."
"28639714","Plasma cytokine IL-6 levels and subjective cognitive decline: preliminary findings.","OBJECTIVE: Detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) prior to clinical inception will be paramount for introducing disease modifying treatments. We have begun collecting baseline characteristics of a community cohort for longitudinal assessment and testing of antecedent blood-based biomarkers. We describe the baseline visit from the first 131 subjects in relationship to a commonly described cytokine, interleukin 6 (IL-6).METHODS: Subjects from the community presented for a free memory screening with varying degrees of memory concern. We quantified the baseline plasma levels of the cytokine IL-6 and assessed cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA) and mood (Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS) in relationship to their memory concern.RESULTS: Baseline MoCA scores were inversely related to age, and this association was influenced by an AD risk factor, Apolipoprotein E (APOE4) carrier status. The degree of subjective cognitive decline correlated with GDS and was inversely related to MoCA scores. Interleukin 6 levels were related to age, body mass index, and years of education.CONCLUSIONS: It will be important to assess how these baseline IL-6 levels and forthcoming novel biomarkers relate to future cognitive decline.

"28584406","The Relationship between Psychosocial Factors and Cognition in Multiple Sclerosis.","INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common disorder in some regions of the world, with over 2.3 million people diagnosed worldwide. Cognitive impairment is one of the earliest symptoms to present in the course of the disease and can cause significant morbidity. We proposed a study to explore the psychosocial predictors of cognitive impairment in MS patients in Saudi Arabia, a previously unexplored patient population.METHODS: Demographic data, depression scale (PHQ9), symptom burden (PHQ15), anxiety (GAD7), disease duration, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) scores were collected from 195 patients in a neurology clinic in Ryiadh, Saudi Arabia. Univariate and multiple regression analyses were conducted to identify variables that are significantly associated with cognitive impairment.DISCUSSION: Both education level and disease duration were variables identified in previous studies. We showed family history to be a significant variable, and no association was found with depression or anxiety, which is unique to our study population.CONCLUSIONS: We identified several psychosocial predictors that are associated with cognition in our patient population. It was also noted that a difference exists between patient populations, highlighting the need for further studies in specific geographical regions."
"28514669","The relationship between cognition and depressive symptoms, and factors modifying this association, in Alzheimer's disease: A multivariate multilevel model.","OBJECTIVES: To examine whether there was a bidirectional association between cognition and depressive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and to explore the role of socio-demographic factors and daily performance in this association.METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study of 104 community-dwelling patients with confirmed AD from Taiyuan, China. We assessed cognition and depressive symptoms (dependent variables) with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Geriatric Depression Scale-30 (GDS-30), respectively. Socio-demographic information and daily performance were treated as explanatory variables. A multivariate multilevel model was built to investigate the interrelationship between patients' cognition and depression, as well as the effect of related factors on both outcomes.CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that cognition was negatively associated with depression in patients with AD, and both were influenced by reading, aluminum utensil use, dietary restriction, and hypertension. Considering patient factors may help to slow the progression of dementia."
"28503706","An eye-tracker controlled cognitive battery: overcoming verbal-motor limitations in ALS.","We assessed language, attention, executive, and social cognition abilities in a sample of patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) by means of a recently developed cognitive battery based on oculomotor control with eye-tracking (ET) technology. Twenty-one ALS patients and 21 age- and education-matched healthy subjects underwent the ET-based cognitive assessment, together with the standard cognitive screening tools [Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB); Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); and Digit Sequencing Task]. Psychological measures of anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Y) and depression (Beck Depression Inventory) were also collected, and an ET usability questionnaire was administered. For patients, clinical and respiratory examinations were also performed, together with behavioural assessment (Frontal Behavioural Inventory). The developed battery discriminated among patients and controls with regard to measures of verbal fluency, frontal abilities, and social cognition. Measures of diagnostic utility confirmed a higher diagnostic accuracy of such ET-based tests with respect to FAB; similar diagnostic accuracy emerged when comparing them to the other standard cognitive tools (MoCA, WM). Usability ratings about the ET tests were comparable among the two groups. The ET-based neuropsychological battery demonstrated good levels of diagnostic accuracy and usability in a clinical population of non-demented ALS patients, compared to matched healthy controls. Future studies will be aimed at further investigate validity and usability components by recruiting larger sample of patients, both in moderate-to-severe stages of the disease and affected by more severe cognitive impairment."

The prevalence of cognitive impairment after kidney transplantation is unknown.METHODS: Study Design: Cross-sectional study.SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Single center study of prevalent kidney transplant recipients from a transplant clinic in a large academic center.INTERVENTION: Assessment of cognition using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Demographic and clinical variables associated with cognitive impairment were also examined. Outcomes and Measurements: a) Prevalence of cognitive impairment defined by a MoCA score of &lt;26. b) Multivariable linear and logistic regression to examine the association of demographic and clinical factors with cognitive impairment.RESULTS: Data from 226 patients were analyzed. Mean (SD) age was 54 (13.4) years, 73% were white, 60% were male, 37% had diabetes, 58% had an education level of college or above, and the mean (SD) time since kidney transplant was 3.4 (4.1) years. The prevalence of cognitive impairment was 58.0%. Multivariable linear regression demonstrated that older age, male gender and absence of diabetes were associated with lower MoCA scores (p &lt; 0.01 for all). Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was not associated with level of cognition. The logistic regression analysis confirmed the association of older age with cognitive impairment.CONCLUSION: Cognitive impairment is common in prevalent kidney transplant recipients, at a younger age compared to general population, and is associated with certain demographic variables, but not level of eGFR."

A preliminary analysis regarding the Cognitive Assessment for Stroke Patients (CASP) battery compared with MMSE and MoCA.","The need for quick tools to sketch an early but accurate cognitive profile of patients who suffered brain damage or head trauma is of primary importance. Nonetheless, in the Italian context, the most-diffused screening tools are still those originally devised to diagnose dementia. The present pilot study then aimed at investigating the potential and feasibility of a novel screening battery, the Cognitive Assessment for Stroke Patients (CASP), in a sample of Italian patients by comparing it to Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) tests. A total of 29 neurology patients took part in the study. Participants underwent a screening procedure including the administration of MMSE, MoCA, and CASP. Data analysis suggested that the scores of the Italian version of the CASP are relatively less affected by the presence of language difficulties-common sequelae of stroke and head traumas-with respect to MMSE and MoCA ones. Furthermore, CASP scores proved to be highly correlated with both MMSE and MoCA scores, showing good clinical potential. Finally, the outcomes of administered tests proved not to be influenced by etiology or gender, and CASP scores showed a diminishing trend related to patients' age and a positive association with patients' education."
"28482634","Cross-Cultural Applicability of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA): A Systematic Review.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is widely used to screen for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). While there are many available versions, the cross-cultural validity of the assessment has not been explored sufficiently. We aimed to interrogate the validity of the MoCA in a cross-cultural context: in differentiating MCI from normal controls (NC); and identifying cut-offs and adjustments for age and education where possible. This review sourced a wide range of studies including case-control studies. In addition, we report findings for differentiating dementias from NC and MCI from dementias, however, these were not considered to be an appropriate use of the MoCA. The subject of the review assumes heterogeneity and therefore meta-analyses was not conducted. Quality ratings, forest plots of validated studies (sensitivity and specificity) with covariates (suggested cut-offs, age, education and country), and summary receiver operating characteristic curve are presented. The results showed a wide range in suggested cutoffs for MCI cross-culturally, with variability in levels of sensitivity and specificity ranging from low to high. Poor methodological rigor appears to have affected reported accuracy and validity of the MoCA. The review highlights the necessity for cross-cultural considerations when using the MoCA, and recognizing it as a screen and not a diagnostic tool. Appropriate cutoffs and point adjustments for education are suggested."

"28376127","The &quot;DOC&quot; screen: Feasible and valid screening for depression, Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and cognitive impairment in stroke prevention clinics.","BACKGROUND: Post-stroke Depression, Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and Cognitive impairment (&quot;DOC&quot;) are associated with greater mortality, worse recovery and poorer quality of life. Best practice recommendations endorse routine screening for each condition; yet, all are under-assessed, diagnosed and treated. We seek to determine the feasibility and validity of an integrated tool (&quot;DOC&quot; screen) to identify stroke clinic patients at high-risk of depression, OSA, and cognitive impairment.METHODS: All consecutive new referrals to a regional Stroke Prevention Clinic who were English-speaking and non-aphasic were eligible to be screened. Time for screen completion was logged. DOC screen results were compared to the neuropsychological battery and polysomnogram assessments using a modified receiver operator characteristic and area under the curve analysis. Data is reported to conform to STARD guidelines.FINDINGS: 1503 people were screened over 2 years. 89% of eligible patients completed the screen in 5 minutes or less (mean 4.2 minutes), less than half the time it takes to complete the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). 437 people consented to detailed testing. Of those, 421 completed the Structured Clinical Interview for Depression within 3 months of screening, 387 completed detailed neuropsychological testing within 3 months, and 88 had overnight polysomnograms. Screening scores combined with demographic variables (age, sex, education, body mass index), had excellent validity compared to gold standard diagnoses: DOC-Mood AUC 0.90; DOC-Apnea AUC 0.80; DOC-Cog AUC 0.81. DOC screen scores can reliably categorize patients in to low-, intermediate- or high-risk groups for further action and can do so with comparable accuracy to more time-consuming screens.CONCLUSIONS: Systematic screening of depression, obstructive sleep apnea, and cognitive impairment in 5 minutes or less is feasible and valid in a high volume stroke clinic using the DOC screen. The DOC screen may facilitate improved identification and treatment of these comorbidities to improve function in patients after stroke and in those with other neurological diseases that share these comorbid conditions (e.g. Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment, Parkinson's disease, Traumatic Brain Injury, multiple sclerosis)."

"28364958","Validation of the Spanish-language version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment test in adults older than 60 years.","INTRODUCTION: Few studies have validated the Spanish-language version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-S) test in Latin American populations.OBJETIVE: To evaluate the psychometric properties and discriminant validity of the MoCA-S in elderly patients in Santiago de Chile.METHODS: 172 individuals were grouped according to their clinical diagnosis based on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale as follows: amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI; n±24), non-amnestic MCI (naMCI; n±24), mild dementia (n±20), and cognitively normal (n±104). Participants were evaluated with both the MoCA-S and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) to determine the discriminant validity of the MoCA-S.RESULTS: Mean age and years of schooling were 73±6 and 11±4 years, respectively, with no significant intergroup differences. The MoCA-S displayed good internal consistency (Cronbach's a: 0.772), high inter-rater reliability (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.846; P&lt;.01), and high intra-rater reliability (test-retest reliability coefficient: 0.922; P&lt;.001). The MoCA-S was found to be an effective and valid test for detecting aMCI (AUC±0.903) and mild dementia (AUC±0.957); its effectiveness for detecting naMCI was lower (AUC±0.629). The optimal cut-off points for aMCI and mild dementia were&lt;21 and&lt;20, respectively, with sensitivity and specificity rates of 75% and 82% for aMCI and 90% and 86% for mild dementia. The level of education had a great impact on scores: as a result, 2 points were added for patients with less than 8 years of schooling and one point for patients with 8-12 years of schooling (MoCA-S1-2). The MoCA-S1-2 showed significantly greater discriminant validity than the MMSE for differentiating aMCI from dementia.CONCLUSIONS: The MoCA-S1-2 is a short, easy-to-use, and useful test for diagnosing aMCI and mild dementia."
"28346532","Decline in changing Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores is associated with post-stroke cognitive decline determined by a formal neuropsychological evaluation.","OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine changes in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores within a one-year period after stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) in associating cognitive decline determined by a formal neuropsychological test battery.METHODS: Patients with ischemic stroke/TIA received MoCA and MMSE at baseline within 14 days after stroke/TIA, at 3-6 months and 1-year follow-ups. The scores of MoCA and MMSE were considered to have declined if there were a reduction of =2 points in the respective scores measured across two time points. The decline in neuropsychological diagnosis transitional status was defined by a category transition from no cognitive impairment or any cognitive impairment to a more severe cognitive impairment or dementia.RESULTS: 275 patients with a mean age of 59.8 ± 11.6 years, and education of 7.7 ± 4.3 years completed all the assessments at baseline, 3-6 months and 1-year follow-ups. A decline in MoCA scores from 3-6 months to 1 year was associated with higher risk of decline in diagnosis transitional status (odd ratio = 3.21, p = 0.004) in the same time period whereas there was no association with a decline in MMSE scores.CONCLUSIONS: The decline in MoCA scores from 3-6 months to 1 year after stroke/TIA has three times higher risk for decline in the diagnosis transitional status. The decline of MoCA scores (reduction = 2points) is associated with the decline in neuropsychological diagnosis transitional status."
"28333925","Video-based educational intervention associated with improved stroke literacy, self-efficacy, and patient satisfaction.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Interventions are needed to improve stroke literacy among recent stroke survivors. We developed an educational video for patients hospitalized with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).METHODS: A 5-minute stroke education video was shown to our AIS and ICH patients admitted from March to June 2015. Demographics and a 5-minute protocol Montreal Cognitive Assessment were also collected. Questions related to stroke knowledge, self-efficacy, and patient satisfaction were answered before, immediately after, and 30 days after the video.RESULTS: Among 250 screened, 102 patients consented, and 93 completed the video intervention. There was a significant difference between pre-video median knowledge score of 6 (IQR 4-7) and the post-video score of 7 (IQR 6-8; p&lt;0.001) and between pre-video and the 30 day score of 7 (IQR 5-8; p = 0.04). There was a significant difference between the proportion of patients who were very certain in recognizing symptoms of a stroke pre- and post-video, which was maintained at 30-days (35.5% vs. 53.5%, p = 0.01; 35.5% vs. 54.4%, p = 0.02). The proportion who were &quot;very satisfied&quot; with their education post-video (74.2%) was significantly higher than pre-video (49.5%, p&lt;0.01), and this was maintained at 30 days (75.4%, p&lt;0.01). There was no association between MoCA scores and stroke knowledge acquisition or retention. There was no association between stroke knowledge acquisition and rates of home blood pressure monitoring or primary care provider follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: An educational video was associated with improved stroke knowledge, self-efficacy in recognizing stroke symptoms, and satisfaction with education in hospitalized stroke patients, which was maintained at 30 days after discharge."

We retrospectively studied whether morning versus afternoon assessment might affect the classification of patients aged 70 or older as severe (SCI), mild (MCI), and no (NCI) cognitive impairment by the MoCA.METHODS: Morning (12 p.m. or earlier) versus afternoon (later than 12 p.m.) proportions of SCI (MoCA score &lt;20), MCI (MoCA score 25-20) and NCI (MoCA score =26) were compared in a cohort of patients aged =70, attending a rapid-access TIA/stroke clinic.RESULTS: Of 278 patients, 113 (40.6%) were tested in the morning and 165 (59.4%) in the afternoon. The proportion with SCI was greater in the afternoon than in the morning (10.9 vs. 1.8%, respectively, p = 0.004), with no difference in age, education, diagnosis, disability, or vascular risk factors.CONCLUSIONS: Time-of-day appears to affect cognitive performance of older patients after they undergo TIA and minor stroke. If our cross-sectional findings are confirmed in cross-over studies with repeated testing, timing of assessments should be considered in clinical practice and in research studies."
"28290234","Preliminary validation study of the Russian Birmingham Cognitive Screen.","INTRODUCTION: The Birmingham Cognitive Screen (BCoS) is designed for use with individuals who have acquired language impairment following stroke. Our goal was to develop a Russian version of the BCoS (Rus-BCoS) by translating the battery following cultural and linguistic adaptations and establishing preliminary data on its psychometric properties.METHOD: Fifty patients with left-hemisphere stroke were recruited, of whom 98% were diagnosed with mild to moderate aphasia. To check whether the Rus-BCoS provides stable and consistent scores, internal consistency, test-retest, and interrater types of reliability were determined. Eight participants with stroke and 20 neurologically intact participants were assessed twice. To inspect the discriminative power of the battery, 63 participants without brain impairment were tested with the Rus-BCoS. Additionally, the Russian version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Quantitative Assessment of Speech in Aphasia, and Luria's Neuropsychological Assessment Battery were used to examine convergent validity, sensitivity, and specificity of the Rus-BCoS.RESULTS: The internal consistency as well as test-retest and interrater reliability of the Rus-BCoS satisfied criteria for the research use. Performance on a majority of tasks in the battery correlated significantly with independently validated tests that putatively measure similar cognitive processes. Critically, all patients with aphasia returned nonzero scores in at least one task in all the Rus-BCoS sections, with the exception of the Controlled Attention section where two patients with severe executive control deficits could not perform.CONCLUSIONS: The Rus-BCoS shows promise as a comprehensive cognitive screening tool that can be used by clinicians working with Russian-speaking persons experiencing poststroke aphasia after much further validation and development of reliable normative standards. Given a lack of quantitative neuropsychological assessment tools in Russia, however, we contend the Rus-BCoS offers potential benefits to clinicians and patients. However, data from research studies with a broader sample of Russian speakers are needed."

Patients were enrolled within 14 days of discharge from the hospital in a 3-week inpatient CR program. Patients were tested for CI using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) upon admission to and discharge from CR. Additionally, sociodemographic, clinical, and physiological variables were documented. The data were analyzed descriptively and in a multivariate stepwise backward elimination regression model with respect to CI.CONCLUSION: The prevalence of CI in CR was considerably high, affecting more than one-third of cardiac patients. Besides age and education level, CI was associated with heavy workloads and a longer sick leave before ACE."

However, the association of hypertension, diabetes and their combination with cognitive functioning is still controversial in older people. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between cognitive decline and hypertension, diabetes, and their combination in 70-year-old people based on a 3-year longitudinal analysis. Four hundred and fifty-four people aged 70 (±1) years who participated in the Japanese longitudinal cohort study of Septuagenarians, Octogenarians and Nonagenarians Investigation with Centenarians (SONIC) were recruited randomly from a general population and were monitored for 3 years. The data, including most of the demographics, cognitive functioning measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Japanese version (MoCA-J), blood pressure, blood chemistry and other medical histories, were collected at baseline and during the follow-up. The prevalence of hypertension noted in the follow-up survey was significantly higher than than noted at baseline. The mean MoCA-J score at follow-up was not significantly different from the score obtained at baseline. However, the participants with diabetes, especially combined with hypertension at baseline, had significantly lower MoCA-J scores than those without lifestyle-related diseases. The combination of hypertension and diabetes was still a significant risk factor for cognitive decline, considering the MoCA-J scores obtained during the follow-up after adjustments at baseline, relative to sex, body mass index, dyslipidemia, smoking, excessive alcohol intake, antihypertensive treatment and education level (ß=-0.14; P&lt;0.01). Our findings indicate that diabetes and the combination of hypertension and diabetes are clear risk factors for future cognitive decline in elderly individuals who are 70 years of age."

The present study estimated the characteristics of cognitive impairment and explored the associated potential factors among chronic MA users.METHODS: The data were from the baseline visit of a longitudinal study among synthetic drug users. The baseline survey was conducted in detoxification and rehabilitation centers in Guangdong province, China, from September to December in 2013. A total of 528 participants were included in our analysis. Cognitive impairment was measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Logistic regression was performed to explore the risk factors associated with cognitive impairment.RESULTS: Approximately 69.89% of the study participants exhibited cognitive impairment according to MoCA scores. Multiple logistic regression analyses indicated that older age (=30 years old), a longer duration of MA use (&gt;24 months), and a higher frequency of MA use (everyday) were associated with cognitive impairment, with adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of 1.58 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-2.34), 1.53 (95%CI: 1.01-2.31), and 1.55 (95%CI: 1.05-2.30), respectively. Methamphetamine users that had a higher level of education had a lower risk of cognitive impairment(OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>.59; 95%CI: .38-.93).CONCLUSIONS AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: Cognitive impairment occurred frequently among chronic MA users. The causal relationship between cognitive impairment and MA use needs to be ascertained in longitudinal studies in future work. Our study provides evidence for the development of intervention strategies for the prevention of MA use and associated cognitive impairment. (Am J Addict 2017;26:145-151)."

The main aim of this study was to examine the correlation and predictability of receptive vocabulary and cognitive functioning of elderly people with anamnestic variables: chronological age, sex, level of formal education, marital status, years of work and retirement and years spent in an institution for the elderly.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The sample of participants consisted of 120 elderly people, average age was 78 years, placed in institutional care for elderly people in four cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was three groups of variables: anamnestic, receptive vocabulary assessment, and cognitive assessments. A Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA) was used for the assessment of cognitive abilities. In order to estimate the receptive vocabulary Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-III-HR) was used.RESULTS: Results of multiple regression analysis show that part of the variance of receptive language which is explained by the model (anamnestic variables) was 44.0% and of cognitive functioning was 33.7%. The biggest single contribution to explaining the development of receptive vocabulary was given by predictor variable of college education (ß = 0.417) then variable university education (ß = 0.293), while the smallest single contribution was given by variable secondary education (ß = 0.167). The biggest single contribution to explaining the results of tests of cognitive function was given by predictor variable College education (ß = 0.328) and variable unskilled (ß = -0.229), which has a negative effect on the increase in recent cognitive functioning.CONCLUSION: Anamnestic variables were valid predictors of receptive vocabulary and cognitive functioning of elderly people. The highest individual contribution was given by variables describing the level of formal education of elderly."
"28074090","Application of Machine Learning in Postural Control Kinematics for the Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease.","The use of wearable devices to study gait and postural control is a growing field on neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this paper, we investigate if machine-learning classifiers offer the discriminative power for the diagnosis of AD based on postural control kinematics. We compared Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Multiple Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBNs), and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) on 72 participants (36 AD patients and 36 healthy subjects) exposed to seven increasingly difficult postural tasks. The decisional space was composed of 18 kinematic variables (adjusted for age, education, height, and weight), with or without neuropsychological evaluation (Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) score), top ranked in an error incremental analysis. Classification results were based on threefold cross validation of 50 independent and randomized runs sets: training (50%), test (40%), and validation (10%). Having a decisional space relying solely on postural kinematics, accuracy of AD diagnosis ranged from 71.7 to 86.1%. Adding the MoCA variable, the accuracy ranged between 91 and 96.6%. MLP classifier achieved top performance in both decisional spaces. Having comprehended the interdynamic interaction between postural stability and cognitive performance, our results endorse machine-learning models as a useful tool for computer-aided diagnosis of AD based on postural control kinematics."
"28039795","Visuomotor adaptability in older adults with mild cognitive decline.","The current study examined the augmentation of error feedback on visuomotor adaptability in older adults with varying degrees of cognitive decline (assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment; MoCA). Twenty-three participants performed a center-out computerized visuomotor adaptation task when the visual feedback of their hand movement error was presented in a regular (ratio=1:1) or enhanced (ratio=1:2) error feedback schedule. Results showed that older adults with lower scores on the MoCA had less adaptability than those with higher MoCA scores during the regular feedback schedule. However, participants demonstrated similar adaptability during the enhanced feedback schedule, regardless of their cognitive ability. Furthermore, individuals with lower MoCA scores showed larger after-effects in spatial control during the enhanced schedule compared to the regular schedule, whereas individuals with higher MoCA scores displayed the opposite pattern. Additional neuro-cognitive assessments revealed that spatial working memory and processing speed were positively related to motor adaptability during the regular scheduled but negatively related to adaptability during the enhanced schedule. We argue that individuals with mild cognitive decline employed different adaptation strategies when encountering enhanced visual feedback, suggesting older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may benefit from enhanced visual error feedback during sensorimotor adaptation."

Neurological examination, neuroimaging assessment [computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for skulls] to diagnose primitive brain tumors, then the confirmation of clinical and histopathological diagnoses were performed for these patients. For cognitive assessment performed before surgery, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG) scales were used. The results were statistically analyzed using the Student's t-test; p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTS: In terms of age, we did not observe statistically significant differences between the three groups of patients. The group of patients with diffuse astrocytoma presented a higher educational level compared to patients with glioblastoma or meningioma. MoCA score obtained in glioblastoma group was 21.7 points, while in the group of patients with diffuse astrocytoma was 23.5 points, and in the group of patients with meningioma 24.2 points. The cognitive assessment using CAMCOG scale led to the following results: group of patients diagnosed with glioblastoma showed an average score of 83.5 points, the diffuse astrocytoma group had an average score of 88.9 points and the group with meningioma an average score of 90.1 points.CONCLUSIONS: Patients diagnosed with glioblastoma showed a statistically significant cognitive decline in comparison to patients diagnosed with diffuse astrocytoma (p&lt;0.05). We did not notice statistically significant differences in the cognitive decline of patients with meningioma compared to those diagnosed with diffuse astrocytoma (p&gt;0.05)."
"29929376","Determining a Short Form Montreal Cognitive Assessment (s-MoCA) Czech Version: Validity in Mild Cognitive Impairment Parkinson's Disease and Cross-Cultural Comparison.","The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is one of the most common screening instruments for mild cognitive impairment. However, the standard MoCA is approximately two times longer to administer than the Mini-Mental State Examination. A total of 699 Czech and 175 American participants received the standard MoCA Czech and English versions and in the clinical part, a sample of 102 nondemented patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We created a validated Czech short version (s-MoCA-CZ) from the original using item response theory. As expected, s-MoCA-CZ scores were highly correlated with the standard version (Pearson r = .94, p &lt; .001). s-MoCA-CZ also had 80% classification accuracy in the differentiation of PD mild cognitive impairment from PD without impairment. The s-MoCA-CZ, a brief screening tool, is shorter to administer than the standard MoCA. It provides high-classification accuracy for PD mild cognitive impairment and is equivalent to that of the standard MoCA-CZ."
"29927920","Audit to investigate junior doctors' knowledge of how to administer and score the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).","AIM: To investigate junior doctors' knowledge of how to conduct the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).METHODS: A two-part questionnaire was administered to junior doctors at teaching sessions across three New Zealand district health boards. Part 1 investigated prior experience and knowledge of the MoCA. Part 2 tested junior doctors' ability to identify errors in administration and how to score the test. Several weeks later a brief MoCA teaching session was given followed immediately by a repeat questionnaire.RESULTS: Seventy-one individuals completed the initial audit and 46 did the follow-up audit. The majority of junior doctors carried out the MoCA on a monthly basis. Prior to our teaching session, only 23% of participants had received formal teaching on how to administer and score the MoCA. The majority (89%) of participants thought that the teaching session had improved their ability to conduct the MoCA. Statistically significant changes were seen in participants' ability to administer the trail-making question and to score the example questions of clock faces, naming animals, serial seven subtractions, verbal fluency testing, abstraction and the awareness about the effect of years of education on the MoCA score.CONCLUSION: Junior doctors administer and score the MoCA but many have not received formal teaching on how to do so. A short teaching session improved their ability to conduct the MoCA and identify errors in administration and scoring."
"29897607","[Use of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in Latin America: a systematic review].","AIM: To analyze the frequency of use of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as a cognitive screening instrument, cross-cultural adaptation, the existence of normative data and clinical validation studies in Latin America Hispanic countries.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus and Scielo databases were consulted between April and June 2017 according to the PRISMA methodology. We included all studies referencing the MoCA as an instrument to evaluate cognitive deterioration conducted in Latin America and that included normative and psychometric data, as well as its clinical validation.RESULTS: Of the 80 studies identified, 19 met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies mentioned the use of the Spanish version of the MoCA and reported a statistically significant effect of gender, age and, most of all, education on the performance of this test. Only five studies presented with a detailed analysis of the psychometric characteristics of the test, and in most articles cut-off scores for the diagnosis of cognitive impairment were the same as the original study.CONCLUSIONS: The small number of articles identified may reflect a late start of the use of MoCA in Latin America. A tendency towards the use of this test without making a cross-cultural adaptation and the use of international norms was observed in this region. The present systematic review demonstrates the need for future research tackling the development of a linguistically adapted version of the MoCA to Latin America and the study of its psychometric properties, with the aim of improving cognitive assessment.TITLE: Uso del test de evaluacion cognitiva de Montreal (MoCA) en America Latina: revision sistematica.Objetivo.

Se ha realizado una revision sistematica de todos los estudios desarrollados en America Latina, con referencia al MoCA, que incluyan datos normativos, datos psicometricos y estudios de baremacion o de validacion clinica. Fueron consultadas sistematicamente, entre abril y junio de 2017, las bases de datos Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus y Scielo, conforme a la metodologia PRISMA. Resultados. De los 80 estudios encontrados, 19 cumplieron los criterios de inclusion. La mayoria de los estudios menciona el uso de la version española y comunica un efecto significativo del sexo, la edad y la escolaridad. El punto de corte adoptado por la mayoria de los autores para el diagnostico de deterioro cognitivo es el mismo del estudio original. Conclusiones. El reducido numero de articulos identificados refleja posiblemente un inicio tardio de la utilizacion del MoCA en America Latina. Esto pone de manifiesto una tendencia en la region a utilizar la prueba sin hacer una adaptacion transcultural de la version original y sin recurrir a normas internacionales para el diagnostico. La presente revision sistematica demuestra la necesidad de trabajos futuros de investigacion que puedan ofrecer una version linguisticamente adaptada del MoCA para America Latina y un estudio de sus propiedades psicometricas, con miras a una evaluacion cognitiva de mayor calidad."

Neuropsychological assessment included Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Trail Making test (part A and part B), Stroop Color and Word Test, verbal fluency test (phonemic verbal fluency and semantic verbal fluency), 10-item word list learning task. All subjects underwent brain MRI. MRI protocol included ASL. Vascular age was calculated by two techniques - using Framingham Heart Study risk tables and SCORE project scales.RESULTS: Patients with EAH had lower performance on phonemic verbal fluency test and lower mean MoCA score (29.2±1.4 vs. 28.1±1.7 points) compared to controls (13.4±3.2, <U+0440>=0.002; 29.2±1.4, p=0.001, respectively). White matter hyperintensities (WMH) were present in 7.5 % controls and in 51.5 % EAH patients (<U+0440>=0.0002). Cerebral blood flow (CBF) in EAH patients was lower in both right (39.1±5.6 vs. 45.8±3.2 ml / 100 g / min) and left frontal lobes of the brain (39.2±6.2 <U+0438> 45.2±3.6 ml / 100 g / min, respectively) compared to controls (<U+0440>."
"29869975","Postural sway in patients with early Parkinson's disease performing cognitive tasks while standing.","OBJECTIVES: We investigated postural sway in patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD) to test the hypothesis that the postural control system was affected already at an early stage of PD. Moreover, we identified cases of dysfunction of stereopsis in PD patients.METHODS: We examined 23 patients with early PD and 23 healthy, sex- and age-matched control subjects. Postural sway was measured with an accelerometer at the center of mass at the lower spine. Subjects were asked to stand quietly for 30 s under two usual conditions (eyes open and eyes closed) and two dual tasks conditions (eyes open with dual task, eyes closed with dual task). Stereopsis was assessed using the Titmus fly test.RESULTS: In the usual conditions, no differences were found between the control group and PD group. With increasing task difficulty, PD patients showed an increase of RMS values of sway acceleration, compared to control subjects. These differences reached significance during cognitive task performance. PD patients showed larger JERK values with increasing difficulty of the sway task which also reached significance during cognitive task performance. Relative to controls, PD patients showed decreased stereopsis function. But, there were no statistically significant correlations between log seconds of arc of the Titmus test and JERK, even during cognitive task performance.CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that patients with early PD have subtle signs of postural instability when their attention is diverted or reduced. In addition, deficits of stereopsis may be common in early PD patients.

"29864048","Minimal Detectable Change in Dual-Task Cost for Older Adults With and Without Cognitive Impairment.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dual-task (DT) training has become a common intervention for older adults with balance and mobility limitations. Minimal detectable change (MDC) of an outcome measure is used to distinguish true change from measurement error. Few studies reporting on reliability of DT outcomes have reported MDCs. In addition, there has been limited methodological DT research on persons with cognitive impairment (CI), who have relatively more difficulty with DTs than persons without CI. The purpose of this study was to describe test-retest reliability and MDC for dual-task cost (DTC) in older adults with and without CI and for DTs of varying difficulty.METHODS: Fifty participants 65 years and older attended 2 test sessions within 7 to 19 days. Participants were in a high cognitive group (n = 27) with a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of 26 or more, or a low cognitive group (n = 23) with a MoCA score of less than 26. During both sessions, we used a pressure-sensing walkway to collect gait data from participants. We calculated motor DTC (the percent decline in motor performance under DT relative to single-task conditions) for 4 DTs: the Timed Up and Go (TUG) while counting forward by ones (TUG1) and counting backward by threes (TUG3); and self-selected walking speed (SSWS) with the same secondary tasks (SSWS1 and SSWS3). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and MDCs were calculated for DTC for the time to complete the TUG and spatiotemporal gait variables during SSWS. A 3-way analysis of variance was used to compare differences in mean DTC between groups, tasks, and sessions.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: ICCs varied across groups and tasks, ranging from 0.02 to 0.76. MDCs were larger for individuals with low cognition and for DTs involving counting backward by threes. For example, the largest MDC was 503.1% for stride width during SSWS3 for individuals with low cognition, and the smallest MDC was 5.6% for cadence during SSWS1 for individuals with high cognition. Individuals with low cognition demonstrated greater DTC than individuals with high cognition. SSWS3 and TUG3 resulted in greater DTC than SSWS1 and TUG1. There were no differences in DTC between sessions for any variable.CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides MDCs for DTC that physical therapists may use to assess change in older adults who engage in DT training. Persons with low cognition who are receiving DT training must exhibit greater change in DTC before one can be confident the change is real. Also, greater change must be observed for more challenging DTs. Thus, cognitive level and task difficulty should be considered when measuring change with DT training."
"29790199","Relationship between cumulative ultraviolet exposure and cognitive function in a rural elderly Chinese population.","OBJECTIVES: Some researchers have focused on the relationship between vitamin D and cognition, but the conclusions are inconsistent. We estimated cumulative UV exposure could be used to represent the individual's long-term vitamin D status and investigated its association with global cognitive function in elderly Chinese.METHODS: A total of 641 participants aged 60 years and over were recruited in a rural area of Shenyang, China. All were interviewed to obtain data regarding sociodemographic characteristics and time spent outdoors. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Beijing version (MoCA-BJ). Images of skin from UV-exposed (dorsal hand) and UV-protected (inner forearm) sites from each individual were graded by the Beagley-Gibson system. Differences in skin-grade between the 2 sites were used to indicate cumulative UV exposure level. Subjects were grouped in tertiles based on skin-grade differences (&lt;1.75, 1.75-2.74, and = 2.75), representing low, medium, and high UV exposure levels, respectively. The MoCA-BJ score was classified in tertiles as low (&lt;19), middle (19-22), and high (=23) levels of cognition. Associations between cognitive function and UV exposure were analyzed using ordinal regression.RESULTS: Skin-grade differences were associated with self-reported time spent outdoors. After adjustment for age, gender, education, BMI, whether living alone, income, diet, hypertension, and diabetes, a high UV exposure level was associated with better cognitive function (odds ratio = 0.643, 95% confidence interval = 0.427-0.969).CONCLUSIONS: Greater cumulative UV exposure appears to be associated with better cognitive function in elderly adults."
"29789033","The neurological examination adapted for neuropsychiatry.","The neuropsychiatric examination includes standard neurological and cognitive examination techniques with several additional observations and tasks designed to capture abnormalities common among patients with neuropsychiatric disorders or neurocognitive complaints. Although useful as a screening tool, a single standardized rating scale such as the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is insufficient to establish a neuropsychiatric diagnosis. Extra attention is paid to findings commonly seen in the setting of psychiatric disorders, dementias, movement disorders, or dysfunction of cortical or subcortical structures. Dysmorphic features, dermatologic findings, neurodevelopmental signs, signs of embellishment, and expanded neurocognitive testing are included. The neuropsychiatric clinician utilizes the techniques described in this article to adapt the examination to each patient's situation, choosing the most appropriate techniques to supplement the basic neurological and psychiatric examinations in support of diagnostic hypotheses being considered. The added examination techniques facilitate diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders and enable neuropsychiatric formulation."
"29778452","Cognitive performance in young and middle-aged adults with migraine: Investigating the correlation with white matter hyperintensities and psychological symptoms.","INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate the cognitive performance of migraine patients with (MwA) and without aura (MwoA) and investigate the correlation of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and psychological symptoms with their cognitive test scores.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Hundred migraine patients aged 20-55 years and 80 healthy volunteers with similar age, sex, and education level were enrolled. The total Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores were compared by age, sex, presence of aura, migraine duration, attack frequency, pain localization, presence and number of WMHs, and the scores of the Beck Depression Inventory and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).RESULTS: Forty-seven (47%) patients had MwA and 53 (53%) had MwoA. The performance of the MwA patients was significantly poorer than that of the MwoA patients and the healthy subjects on the MoCA scales. In particular, the results revealed lower scores in the subscales regarding visuospatial/executive functions, naming, memory, attention, and abstraction in MwA patients than in the MwoA patients. Compared to healthy controls, more number of migraine patients had WMHs. The presence and number of WMHs had no significant correlation with the MoCA scores of the migraine patients. There was a significant correlation of the BAI and BDI scores with the total MoCA scores considering all migraine patients.CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that MwA may be associated with low cognitive performance which was correlated with depression and anxiety but not with WMHs. Further, longitudinal studies for assessing the relationship between WMHs, cognitive functions, and migraine, and for establishing the causality are warranted."

"29753804","The association between serum vitamin d level and cognitive function in older adults: Cooper Center Longitudinal Study.","Low blood level of vitamin D and low physical activity have been linked to the development of cognitive impairment in older adults. The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between serum vitamin D and cognition as measured via the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in a healthy, older population. The study sample consisted of 4358 patients from the Cooper Clinic in Dallas, TX. All participants underwent a maximal graded exercise test to determine cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). Cognitive impairment was defined as a MoCA score &lt;25. Low vitamin D status was defined as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;30<U+202F>ng/mL. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was employed to evaluate the association between vitamin D blood level and MoCA score. A low MoCA score was directly associated with higher age (OR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.53, 1.99), and inversely associated with female sex (OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.77), and years of education (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.84, 0.91). When controlling for significant predictors (age, sex, and education), the low vitamin D group had a significantly greater likelihood of having a low MoCA score (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.51). The vitamin D effect remained significant when CRF was added to the model (OR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.48). In conclusion, low vitamin D was shown to be associated with cognitive impairment. Therefore, preventive measures such as vitamin D supplementation may play a protective role in memory loss and/or age-associated cognitive decline."
"29722955","Increased Iron Deposition on Brain Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping Correlates with Decreased Cognitive Function in Alzheimer's Disease.","The excessive accumulation of iron in deep gray structures is an important pathological characteristic in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is more specific than other imaging-based iron measurement modalities and allows noninvasive assessment of tissue magnetic susceptibility, which has been shown to correlate well with brain iron levels. This study aimed to investigate the correlations between the magnetic susceptibility values of deep gray matter nuclei and the cognitive functions assessed by mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) in patients with mild and moderate AD. Thirty subjects with mild and moderate AD and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were scanned with a 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. The magnetic susceptibilities of the regions of interest (ROIs), including caudate nucleus (Cd), putamen (Pt), globus pallidus (Gp), thalamus (Th), red nucleus (Rn), substantia nigra (Sn), and dentate nucleus (Dn), were quantified by QSM. We found that the susceptibility values of the bilateral Cd and Pt were significantly higher in AD patients than the controls ( P &lt; 0.05). In contrast, bilateral Rn had significantly lower susceptibility values in AD than the controls. Regardless of gender and age, the increase of magnetic susceptibility in the left Cd was significantly correlated with the decrease of MMSE scores and MoCA scores ( P &lt; 0.05). Our study indicated that magnetic susceptibility value of left Cd could be potentially used as a biomarker of disease severity in mild and moderate AD."

We examined the cognitive function in hemodialysis (HD) patients and compared the Korean versions of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (K-MoCA) and of the Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) to identify the better cognitive screening instrument in these patients. Thirty patients undergoing hemodialysis and 30 matched reference group of apparently healthy control were included. All subjects underwent the K-MoCA, K-MMSE and a neuropsychological test battery to measure attention, visuospatial function, language, memory and executive function. All cognitive data were converted to z-scores with appropriate age and education level prior to group comparisons. Cognitive performance 1.0 SD below the mean was defined as modest cognitve impairment while 1.5 below the mean was defined as severe cognitive impairment. Modest cognitive impairment in memory plus other cognitive domains was detected in 27 patients (90%) while severe cognitive impairment in memory plus other cognitive domains was detected in 23 (77%) patients. Total scores in the K-MoCA were significantly lower in HD patients than in the reference group. However, no significant group difference was found in the K-MMSE. The K-MMSE ROC AUC (95% confidence interval) was 0.72 (0.59-0.85) and K-MoCA ROC AUC was 0.77 (0.65-0.89). Cognitive impairment is common but under-diagnosed in this population.

Primary endpoints were the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Other motor and non-motor data were also assessed. The Mann-Whitney U Test was utilized to compare LRRK2 G2019S carriers with PD (LRRK2+) with non-carrier PD controls who were matched for age, gender, education, and PD duration. Survival analyses and log rank tests were utilized to compare interval from onset of PD to development of motor and non-motor complications.RESULTS: We screened 251 subjects and 231 completed the study, of whom 9 were LRRK2+, including 7 AJ subjects. 22.73% of AJ subjects with a family history of PD (FH) and 12.96% of AJ subjects without a FH were LRRK2+. There were no significant differences between the 9 LRRK2+ subjects and 19 matched PD controls in MDS-UPDRS, MoCA, or other motor and non-motor endpoints.CONCLUSION: Prevalence of the LRRK2 G2019S mutation in AJ and non-AJ subjects in our study population in Cleveland, Ohio was comparable to other clinical studies. There were no significant motor or non-motor differences between LRRK2+ PD and matched PD controls."

"29614659","Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Cognitive Function are Positively Related Among Participants with Mild and Subjective Cognitive Impairment.","BACKGROUND: By 2030, about 74 million people will be diagnosed with dementia, and many more will experience subjective (SCI) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). As physical inactivity has been identified to be a strong modifiable risk factor for dementia, exercise and physical activity (PA) may be important parameters to predict the progression from MCI to dementia, but might also represent disease trajectory modifying strategies for SCI and MCI.OBJECTIVE: A better understanding of the relationship between activity, fitness, and cognitive function across the spectrum of MCI and SCI would provide an insight into the potential utility of PA and fitness as early markers, and treatment targets to prevent cognitive decline.METHODS: 121 participants were stratified into three groups, late MCI (LMCI), early MCI (EMCI), and SCI based on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Cognitive function assessments also included the Trail Making Test A+B, and a verbal fluency test. PA levels were evaluated with an interviewer-administered questionnaire (LAPAQ) and an activity monitor. An incremental exercise test was performed to estimate cardiorespiratory fitness and to determine exercise capacity relative to population normative data.RESULTS: ANCOVA revealed that LMCI subjects had the lowest PA levels (LAPAQ, p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.018; activity monitor, p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.041), and the lowest exercise capacity in relation to normative values (p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.041). Moreover, a modest correlation between MoCA and cardiorespiratory fitness (r<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.25; p<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>0.05) was found.CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that during the earliest stages of cognitive impairment PA and exercise capacity might present a marker for the risk of further cognitive decline. This finding warrants further investigation using longitudinal cohort studies."
"29608442","Cognitive assessment of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate cognitive performance for the first time in participants with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: In total, 70 participants with NAFLD and 73 age-matched and sex-matched healthy participants were enrolled in this prospective cross-sectional study. The diagnosis of NAFLD was made on the basis of abdominal ultrasonography findings. Anthropometric indices were calculated, and routine laboratory analyses were carried out for each participant. All participants provided sociodemographic data and completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Cognitive functions were evaluated using the Turkish version of the MoCA, with a cut-off score for mild cognitive impairment of less than 21 points.RESULTS: The MoCA scores were significantly lower in participants with NAFLD than in the healthy group (P&lt;0.05). In addition, more NAFLD participants than healthy participants presented with deficits in the visuospatial (P&lt;0.05) and executive function domains (P&lt;0.05). In the multivariate model, education level [2.79 (1.12-6.96); P&lt;0.05] and area of residence [5.68 (2.24-14.38); P&lt;0.001] were associated independently with cognitive dysfunction in both the NAFLD and the healthy groups. The MoCA scores were correlated negatively with fibrosis 4 scores in NAFLD participants (r=-0.359; P&lt;0.05). However, hepatosteatosis grade and the presence of metabolic syndrome were not correlated with MoCA scores in the NAFLD group (P&gt;0.05).CONCLUSION: Our results show that NAFLD patients may have early or subtle cognitive dysfunction, including in the visuospatial and executive function domains, as indexed by scores on the MoCA test. Further targeted psychometric testing will be required to confirm the presence of cognitive impairment in this population."

MetS is also associated with cognitive decline. However, the correlation between FGF21 and cognitive decline in elderly and nonelderly MetS patients has not been investigated. 116 non-elderly patients (age &lt;65 years old) and 96 elderly patients (=65 years old) with MetS were enrolled. Blood samples for FGF21 were collected from all participants after 12-hour fasting. Cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) test. The MoCA score was negatively associated with age and was different among different levels of education in these MetS patients. In the non-elderly group, body mass index (BMI) showed positively correlated with MoCA score while, FGF21 level and HbA1C were negatively associated with the MoCA score in non-elderly MetS patients. BMI was the only factor which showed a negative correlation with the MoCA score in elderly MetS patients. This study demonstrated that FGF21 level was independently associated with cognitive impairment in non-elderly patients but not in elderly patients. The possible role of FGF21 level in cognitive impairment in non-elderly should be confirmed in a prospective study."

"29547067","Portable eyetracking-based assessment of memory decline.","INTRODUCTION: Preferential viewing of novel stimuli in the Visual Paired Comparison task has provided a useful marker of memory and medial temporal lobe function. We created a portable version of the VPC (P-VPC) and contrasted P-VPC metrics against the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in healthy adults, to assess the validity and reliability of the P-VPC as an indicator of memory function across age. A supplementary case series was conducted with individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias, to provide a preliminary illustration of the P-VPC's use as a measure in clinical populations.METHOD: Participants (n = 207) were tested using the P-VPC. Individuals were familiarized with a set of objects, which were each presented alongside a novel object in the test phase. Novelty viewing scores were compared to MoCA scores to index concurrent validity. Item analyses were conducted as a test of internal reliability of the P-VPC. A complementary clinical case series was conducted with AD (n = 4) and dementia (n = 5) participants, who were tested using the P-VPC and further compared to healthy age-matched participants.RESULTS: Preferential viewing decreased with age in healthy participants, and was positively correlated with MoCA scores. Compared to the MoCA, P-VPC scores did not differ based on education and/or whether English was spoken as the native language. Item analyses revealed acceptable internal consistency. P-VPC viewing percentiles of healthy participants were modeled as a function of age, and illustrated that individuals of the clinical case series diagnosed with AD scored in below-average percentiles, while those with dementia did not score below-average.CONCLUSION: Good concurrent validity and acceptable internal reliability were observed, and P-VPC scores were not confounded by education or language experience. Low performance was observed in individuals with clinically diagnosed AD, suggesting that the P-VPC may be a potential tool for screening memory decline."
"29529530","Olfactory dysfunction in multiple sclerosis.","BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common chronic neurological disease that causes disability. MS can have various clinical manifestations, one of which is olfactory dysfunction. In clinical practice, olfactory disturbances are usually underdiagnosed. The aim of our study is to assess olfactory function and its relationship with MS disease duration, disability and cognition.METHOD: We assessed 31 MS patients and 24 healthy controls matched in sex and age at our MS outpatient clinic of the Istanbul Education and Research Hospital Neurology Department. Each subject was interviewed to obtain demographic data. The Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC) olfactory test and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) were applied to each participant.RESULTS: The CCCRC test scores of the MS patients were lower than those in the control group (p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.05). Patients with a longer disease duration and more frequent attacks had lower CCCRC scores (p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.05). The Expanded Disability Status Scale scores had no correlation with the CCCRC test scores. The MOCA score was positively correlated with all domains of the olfactory test scores.CONCLUSION: This study supports the presence of olfactory dysfunction in early stages of MS and the correlation of cognitive impairment with olfactory dysfunction, even in the early stages of the disease in young and less physically- disabled patients. The assessment of olfaction may be helpful as a surrogate method for tracking disease progression in patients over time."

The norms (corrected for age, sex, education, ethnicity) were applied to 342 HIV-positive virally suppressed individuals on cART. Impairment rates were classified using the Global Deficit Score (GDS<U+2009>=<U+2009>.5) method. The MoCA was also scored according to the recommended cut-off of<U+2009>=<U+2009>26, and functional decline was applied to both impairment definitions to classify HAND per the Frascati criteria. The<U+2009>=<U+2009>26 cut-off considerably overestimated cognitive impairment in both samples (59.4% HIV-negative; 69.3% HIV-positive). In contrast, corrected scores yielded impairment rates consistent with what has been reported internationally in virally suppressed cohorts (23.4% with 83.3% mild impairment, 16.7% moderate impairment).

However, less attention has been paid to multi-domain cognitive health for the elderly, and the role of lifestyle factors in each domain remains unclear.METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 3,230 older adults aged 60+ years in Xiamen, China, in 2016. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to measure general cognition and six specific sub-domains. To account for educational effects, we adjusted the MoCA score and divided respondents into three education-specific groups (low, moderate, and high education groups with =5, 6~8, and =9 years of education, respectively). A series of proportional odds models were used to detect the associations between two categories of lifestyle factors - substance abuse (cigarette and alcohol) and leisure activity (TV watching, reading, smartphone use, social activity, and exercise) - and general cognition and the six sub-domains in those three groups.RESULTS: Among the 3,230 respondents, 2,617 eligible participants were included with a mean age of 69.05 ± 7.07 years. Previous or current smoking/drinking was not associated with MoCA scores in the whole population, but unexpectedly, the ex-smokers in the low education group performed better in general cognition (OR = 2.22) and attention (OR = 2.05) than their never-smoking counterparts. Modest TV watching, reading, and smartphone use also contributed to better cognition among elderly participants in the low education group. For the highly educated elderly, comparatively longer reading (&gt;3.5 hours/week) was inversely associated with general cognition (OR = 0.53), memory (OR = 0.59), and language (OR = 0.54), while adequate exercise (5~7 days/week) was positively related to these factors with OR = 1.48, OR = 1.49, and OR = 1.53, respectively. For the moderately educated elderly, only modest reading was significantly beneficial.CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle factors play different roles in multidimensional cognitive health in different educational groups, indicating that individual intervention strategies should be designed according to specific educational groups and different cognitive sub-domains."

Dementia has been excluded with the Functional Activities Questionnaire. The final sample consisted of 597 cognitively healthy Brazilians aged 50 to 90 years. To account for nonlinear relationships, we have used fractional polynomials that provide a flexible parameterization for continuous variables.RESULTS: According to the original proposed cutoff (=25 points), 87% of our sample would be considered impaired. Even using a more conservative suggestion (=22 points), 67% of our normative sample would be regarded as impaired. These data reinforce the need of adjusting cutoffs for schooling in populations with heterogeneous educational backgrounds. MoCA scores presented a nonlinear positive association with education tending to a plateau at higher levels (P &lt; 0.001). On the other hand, MoCA-MIS scores presented a nonlinear negative relationship with age, with an accelerated pattern at higher age levels (P &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: We presented normative data for the MoCA and the MoCA-MIS that will facilitate the use of the test in Brazil and, potentially, in other populations with substantial proportions of low-educated individuals. Moreover, we described a systematic approach for adjusting the effects of age and education using fractional polynomials and provided suggestions on how to account for the nonlinear relationship that is frequently encountered between demographic factors and measures of cognitive performance."

"29358749","Impaired Functional Criticality of Human Brain during Alzheimer's Disease Progression.","The progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) has been proposed to comprise three stages, subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD. Was brain dynamics across the three stages smooth? Was there a critical transition? How could we characterize and study functional criticality of human brain? Based on dynamical characteristics of critical transition from nonlinear dynamics, we proposed a vertex-wise Index of Functional Criticality (vIFC) of fMRI time series in this study. Using 42 SCD, 67 amnestic MCI (aMCI), 34 AD patients as well as their age-, sex-, years of education-matched 54 NC, our new method vIFC successfully detected significant patient-normal differences for SCD and aMCI, as well as significant negative correlates of vIFC in the right middle temporal gyrus with total scores of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in SCD. In comparison, standard deviation of fMRI time series only detected significant differences between AD patients and normal controls. As an index of functional criticality of human brain derived from nonlinear dynamics, vIFC could serve as a sensitive neuroimaging marker for future studies; considering much more vIFC impairments in aMCI compared to SCD and AD, our study indicated aMCI as a critical stage across AD progression."

However, the relationship between hyper echogenicity in substantia nigra (SN) and clinical symptoms of PD patients remains unknown, and the role of dysfunction of iron metabolism on the pathogenesis of SN hyper echogenicity is unclear.METHODS: PD patients was detected by transcranial sonography and divided into with no hyper echogenicity (PDSN-) group and with hyper echogenicity (PDSN+) group. Motor symptoms (MS) and non-motor symptoms (NMS) were evaluated, and the levels of iron and related proteins in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were detected for PD patients. Data comparison between the two groups and correlation analyses were performed.RESULTS: PDSN+ group was significantly older, and had significantly older age of onset, more advanced Hohen-Yahr stage, higher SCOPA-AUT score and lower MoCA score than PDSN- group (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). Compared with PDSN- group, the levels of transferrin and light-ferritin in serum and iron level in CSF were significantly elevated (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05), but ferroportin level in CSF was significantly decreased in PDSN+ group (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05).CONCLUSIONS: PD patients with hyper echogenicity in SN are older, at more advanced disease stage, have severer motor symptoms, and non-motor symptoms of cognitive impairment and autonomic dysfunction. Hyper echogenicity of SN in PD patients is related to dysfunction of iron metabolism, involving increased iron transport from peripheral system to central nervous system, reduction of intracellular iron release and excessive iron deposition in brain."

The association between MoCA-SA scores and sociodemographic and health-related risk factors were determined.RESULTS: MoCA-SA scores decreased with age, and there were substantial differences among sex, education, and race/ethnicity groups. Poor physical health, functional status, and depression were also associated with lower cognitive performance; current health behaviors were not. Using the recommended MoCA cut-point score for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MoCA score &lt;26; MoCA-SA score &lt;17), 72% (95% confidence interval, 69% to 74%) of older US adults would be classified as having some degree of cognitive impairment.CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide an important national estimate for interpreting MoCA scores from individual patients, and establish wide variability in cognition among older home-dwelling US adults. Care should be taken in applying previously-established MoCA cut-points to the general population, especially when evaluating individuals from educationally and ethnically diverse groups."

"29310015","Balance and fear of falling in subjects with Parkinson's disease is improved after exercises with motor complexity.","Resistance training with instability (RTI) uses exercises with high motor complexity that impose high postural control and cognitive demands that may be important for improving postural instability and fear of falling in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we hypothesized that: 1) RTI will be more effective than resistance training (RT) in improving balance (Balance Evaluation Systems Test [BESTest] and overall stability index [Biodex Balance System<sup>®</sup>]) and fear of falling (Falls Efficacy Scale-International [FES-I] score) of subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD); and 2) changes in BESTest and FES-I after RTI will be associated with changes in cognitive function (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] score - previously published) induced by RTI. Thirty-nine subjects with moderate PD were randomly assigned to a nonexercising control, RT, and RTI groups. While RT and RTI groups performed progressive RT twice a week for 12 weeks, the RTI group added progressive unstable devices to increase motor complexity of the resistance exercises. There were significant group<U+202F>×<U+202F>time interactions for BESTest, overall stability index, and FES-I scores (P<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.05). Only RTI improved BESTest, overall stability index and FES-I scores, and RTI was more effective than RT in improving biomechanical constraints and stability in gait (BESTest sections) at post-training (P<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.05). There were strong correlations between relative changes in BESTest and MoCA (r<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.72, P<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.005), and FES-I and MoCA (r<U+202F>=<U+202F>-0.75, P<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.003) after RTI. Due to the increased motor complexity in RTI, RTI is recommended for improving balance and fear of falling, which are associated with improvement in cognitive function of PD."

However, many previous studies on this topic used insensitive oral indicators or did not include certain essential covariates. Thus, we examined the association between occlusal force and cognitive function in a large sample of older adults, controlling for dietary intake, vascular risk factors, inflammatory biomarkers, depression, and genetic factors.</AbstractText>: Growing evidence suggests that oral health may be an important factor associated with cognitive function in aged populations.

Thus, we examined the association between occlusal force and cognitive function in a large sample of older adults, controlling for dietary intake, vascular risk factors, inflammatory biomarkers, depression, and genetic factors.In this cross-sectional study of older community-dwelling Japanese adults, we examined data collected from 994 persons aged 70 years and 968 persons aged 80 years. Cognitive function was measured using the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J). Oral status and function were evaluated according to the number of remaining teeth, periodontal pocket depth, and maximal occlusal force. Associations between MoCA-J scores and occlusal force were investigated via bivariate and multivariate analyses.</AbstractText>: In this cross-sectional study of older community-dwelling Japanese adults, we examined data collected from 994 persons aged 70 years and 968 persons aged 80 years.

Oral status and function were evaluated according to the number of remaining teeth, periodontal pocket depth, and maximal occlusal force. Associations between MoCA-J scores and occlusal force were investigated via bivariate and multivariate analyses.Education level, financial status, depression score, and intake of green and yellow vegetables, as well as number of teeth and occlusal force, were significantly correlated with MoCA-J scores in both age groups. Among individuals aged 80 years, CRP and periodontal status were weakly but significantly associated with MoCA-J score. After controlling for all significant variables via bivariate analyses, the correlation between maximal occlusal force and cognitive function persisted. A path analysis confirmed the hypothesis that cognitive function is associated with occlusal force directly as well as indirectly via food intake.</AbstractText>: Education level, financial status, depression score, and intake of green and yellow vegetables, as well as number of teeth and occlusal force, were significantly correlated with MoCA-J scores in both age groups.

"29292529","Converting MMSE to MoCA and MoCA 5-minute protocol in an educationally heterogeneous sample with stroke or transient ischemic attack.","BACKGROUND: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is psychometrically superior over the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) for cognitive screening in stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). It is free for clinical and research use. The objective of this study is to convert scores from the MMSE to MoCA and MoCA-5-minute protocol (MoCA-5 min) and to examine the ability of the converted scores in detecting cognitive impairment after stroke or TIA.METHODS: A total of 904 patients were randomly divided into training (n = 623) and validation (n = 281) samples matched for demography and cognition. MMSE scores were converted to MoCA and MoCA-5 min using (1) equipercentile method with log-linear smoothing and (2) Poisson regression adjusting for age and education. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was used to examine the ability of the converted scores in differentiating patients with cognitive impairment.RESULTS: The mean education was 5.8 (SD = 4.6; ranged 0-20) years. The entire spectrum of MMSE scores was converted to MoCA and MoCA-5 min using equipercentile method. Relationship between MMSE and MoCA scores was confounded by age and education, and a conversion equation with adjustment for age and education was derived. In the validation sample, the converted scores differentiated cognitively impaired patients with area under receiver operating characteristics curve 0.826 to 0.859.CONCLUSION: We provided 2 methods to convert scores from the MMSE to MoCA and MoCA-5 min based on a large sample of patients with stroke or TIA having a wide range of education and cognitive levels. The converted scores differentiated patients with cognitive impairment after stroke or TIA with high accuracy."
