"11082789","Bedside cardiac examination: constancy in a sea of change.","The general trend in the recent literature has been to highlight the difficulties and shortcomings of the physical examination and to attribute these difficulties to deficiencies in training rather than to intrinsic weaknesses in auscultation itself. The call is for better training. Given the advice of the authors mentioned above, individual training may be warranted at the postgraduate level and in the large community of practicing internists and cardiologists. Although not proven, it is likely that individual training with computer technology, audiotape instruction, or simulator technology such as described in the following paragraphs would be effective at improving bedside clinical diagnosis and cost-effective patient care in the postgraduate, continuing medical education setting. The advances in auscultation during the last few years have been more incremental than fundamental. There is ongoing research into the mechanism of production of S3 and S4, and mathematical modeling techniques have recently been used with some success in evaluating the vibrations of S3 and S4 as forced, damped oscillations of a viscoelastic system. Analysis of sound energy with the technique of spectral waveform analysis, which investigates the frequency content of sound signals, has been used for many years in the study of cardiovascular sound. By the use of various methods of mathematical analysis, investigators have found potentially useful information in spectral sound patterns of prosthetic valves, murmur characteristics, and even potentially hemodynamic information from heart sounds. Despite the mathematical advances, there are still disturbing drawbacks to some of the analytic techniques, such as the production of mathematical terms containing &quot;negative energy.&quot; Although the potential of obtaining significant clinical information from spectral analysis of heart sound recordings is attractive, the clinical usefulness of such techniques remains virtually nonexistent. Similar to the recent advances in auscultation, the technical advances in the design of the stethoscope have also been more incremental than fundamental. There are at least 3 recently introduced electronic stethoscopes that have the capability of amplification and filtration and that claim noise reduction. Because their introduction is recent, no information is available in the peer-review literature regarding their clinical performance; therefore their place in the clinical arena remains to be elucidated--perhaps a boon for patient care providers with specific hearing defects and perhaps useful in noisy clinical environments. Peer-review literature has not shown clear superiority of one type of acoustic stethoscope over another. The teaching of auscultation has been an area of recognized importance in patient care since the inception of auscultation as a medical art. Attempts to facilitate practitioner learning in the performance and interpretation of auscultation have advanced through the decades limited only by the technical infrastructure of the day. The availability of recorded heart sounds and murmurs appeared shortly after the availability of recording and playback devices, with first vinyl and later tape recordings. In 1974, technology was employed to create a virtual patient named &quot;Harvey,&quot; an engineered cardiology patient simulator that reproduces many of the physical findings of the cardiology examination. Later, with the advent of commercially available CD-ROM devices, newer, better-integrated teaching devices have been developed, some of them outstanding in their clarity and quality. Despite the obvious value of such instructional aids that are best used in the individual setting, there is evidence that the classroom is still of significant value in teaching auscultation. However, nowhere else in the practice of medicine is a mentor approach more valuable than in learning auscultation. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)"
"10990019","Visual cognitive tests, central auditory function and auditory communication.","A cognitive, text-based test battery, presented as text on a computer screen (TIPS), was used to assess properties of central cognitive processing relevant for visual and audiovisual speech comprehension. TIPS was compared and contrasted with another, purely auditory, battery, ACE, aimed at assessing afferent (A), central (C) and efferent (E) auditory communicative functions. The results show that there is no overlap with the 'A' component, but some overlap between TIPS parameters and the 'C' component, especially when the auditory-language tests are used in the C estimate. However, the TIPS parameters show high correlations with the 'E' component (i.e. measuring output and phonological parameters), suggesting that the efferent component may be composed of an interesting central feature. TIPS parameters do not fare as well in the predictions of the auditory ecological test performances, but the ACE parameters do, especially when organized according to a cognitive complexity parameter. In order to optimize the conceptual and practical benefit of the TIPS and ACE concepts, TIPS needs to be adapted auditorily and ACE tests need to be audiovisual. These developments will become important for ecological audiology."
"10692961","Empowering the deaf. Let the deaf be deaf.","Deafness is often regarded as just a one and only phenomenon. Accordingly, deaf people are pictured as a unified body of people who share a single problem. From a medical point of view, we find it usual to work with a classification of deafness in which pathologies attributable to an inner ear disorder are segregated from pathologies attributable to an outer/middle ear disorder. Medical intervention is thus concerned more with the origin, degree, type of loss, onset, and structural pathology of deafness than with communicative disability and the implications there may be for the patient (mainly dependency, denial of abnormal hearing behaviour, low self esteem, rejection of the prosthetic help, and the breakdown of social relationships). In this paper, we argue that hearing loss is a very complex phenomenon, which has many and serious consequences for people and involves many factors and issues that should be carefully examined. The immediate consequence of deafness is a breakdown in communication whereby the communicative function needs to be either initiated or restored. In that sense, empowering strategies--aimed at promoting not only a more traditional psychological empowerment but also a community one--should primarily focus on the removal of communication barriers."
"10674419","Decision tree induction in the diagnosis of otoneurological diseases.","Expert systems have been applied in medicine as diagnostic aids and education tools. The construction of a knowledge base for an expert system may be a difficult task; to automate this task several machine learning methods have been developed. These methods can be also used in the refinement of knowledge bases for removing inconsistencies and redundancies, and for simplifying decision rules. In this study, decision tree induction was employed to acquire diagnostic knowledge for otoneurological diseases and to extract relevant parameters from the database of an otoneurological expert system ONE. The records of patients with benign positional vertigo, Meniere's disease, sudden deafness, traumatic vertigo, vestibular neuritis and vestibular schwannoma were retrieved from the database of ONE, and for each disease, decision trees were constructed. The study shows that decision tree induction is a useful technique for acquiring diagnostic knowledge for otoneurological diseases and for extracting relevant parameters from a large set of parameters."
"11683459","Will hearing healthcare be affordable in the new millennium.","Calculations of the needs of healthcare, hearing healthcare included, are usually based on clinical data rather than on valid prevalence figures. According to our recent population study, the number of citizens needing hearing aids in Finland will be twice the figure usually presented, 280 000 for the country as a whole (population 5.1 million). The penetration of hearing aids was only 41%. Taking this and the ageing of the population into account, the economic challenges of hearing healthcare will be alarming in the new millennium."
"23119826","Effect of hearing AIDS on psychosocial dysfunctioning.","The perception of communication abilities amongest adolescents with moderate and profound hearing loss was correlated with indices of psychosocial adjustment. This was done to determine whether the use of hearing aids could play a role in presence and improvement of psychosocial functioning among acquired hearing loss persons after the use of hearing aids. Amongest the deaf population, it was found that hearing loss did affect the social, the vocational, the personal and subjective well being, after intervention. The control group did not show any corresponding change except that the state anxiety among this group had increased."
"11523204","HIV/AIDS knowledge and information sources among deaf and hearing college students.","A sample of 34 deaf undergraduate college students at Gallaudet University and 46 hearing undergraduate college students at the University of Maryland Baltimore County completed a questionnaire that asked about their knowledge and sources of information concerning the human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). The deaf students had significantly lower scores on an &quot;HIV/AIDS Knowledge Index&quot; than the hearing students. This difference could not be explained by the deaf students' gender, class standing, family structure, or father's or mother's education level. The deaf students obtained more of their information about HIV/AIDS from family and friends than the hearing students, who relied to a greater extent on teachers, television, and reading material. The interpersonal sources used by the deaf students are more prone to factual errors than formal sources. Deaf students need methods of educating themselves about HIV/AIDS that are more accurate and that recognize the importance of sources as well as the content of information."
"11364896","Policy's STD exclusion does not cover AIDS discrimination.","A Federal judge in Philadelphia ordered General Star Indemnity Company to pay litigation and settlement expenses incurred by the 12th Street Gym. General Star maintained that the insurance policy sold to the gym excluded all claims arising from sexually transmitted diseases. The gym had to defend itself in a civil lawsuit brought by a client who claimed he was ejected because he had AIDS. When General Star refused to pay to defend the suit or cover judgement, 12th Street Gym sought a declaratory judgement in U.S. District Court to resolve the dispute. After the patron died, his estate reached a settlement with the gym, and while General Star Indemnity agreed to pay defense costs for litigation and advanced the gym the cash for the settlement, it reserved the right to seek repayment once the declaratory judgment was made. In June 1995 a U.S. district judge found in favor of the gym but the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing. The judge then determined that the wording of the policy was ambiguous and ruled that the plausible interpretation of the policy would prevail, thereby ordering the insurance company to reimburse the gym for the cost of defending and settling this lawsuit."
"11360697","A randomised controlled trial of screening for adult hearing loss during preventive health checks.","BACKGROUND: Prophylactic strategies to counter acquired hearing impairment may involve routine audiometric screening of asymptomatic working-age adults attending general practice for regular health checks.AIM: To evaluate the effect of adult hearing screening on subsequent noise exposure and hearing.DESIGN OF STUDY: A randomised controlled population-based study of health checks and health discussions in general practice.SETTING: The project was initiated in the district of Ebeltoft, Aarhus county, Denmark.METHOD: Intervention group participants' hearing thresholds were determined audiometrically at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 kHz in each ear. Participants were advised to get their ears checked if the average hearing loss exceeded 20 dB hearing level (dBHL) in either ear. Noise avoidance was emphasised when thresholds exceeded 25 dBHL bilaterally at 4 kHz. Follow-up included questionnaires and audiometry.RESULTS: Hearing loss was observed among 18.9% of the study sample at baseline. At the five-year follow-up we recorded no significant differences between the control and the intervention groups regarding subjective or objective hearing, or exposure to occupational noise. However, there was a tendency towards reduction in exposure to leisure noise among intervention participants (P = 0.045). Approximately 20% reported hearing problems; 16.5% reported tinnitus-related complaints; 0.8% used hearing aids; 35.0% reported frequent noise exposure; and occluding wax was suspected in 2.1%.CONCLUSION: Preventive health checks with audiometry did not significantly affect hearing, but leisure noise exposure tended to become less frequent. The poor effect may be ascribed to inadequate audiological counselling or a higher priority to other advice, e.g. on cardiovascular risk or lifestyle."
"11347426","Improving design project experiences through improved assessment practices.","This paper is offered as an introduction to the ways in which improved foci on educational outcomes associated with engineering design project experiences may lead to: (a) improvements in the learning of engineering students and consequently, (b) improved knowledge, design and technology to benefit individuals in need. Strategies to improve learning outcomes of design experiences include clearly articulating what it is that we want students to know and achieve, having detailed means of assessing each of the learning outcomes we target, communicating about the assessment process with students from the start of their design experiences, and providing thorough evaluative feedback to students to foster learning while we still have access to them. This paper is based on ongoing work within the National Science Foundation (NSF) Senior Design Projects to Aid Persons with Disabilities program. Readers are invited to collaborate in further efforts in this area."
"11316050","Development of the Three-Clinic Hearing Aid Selection Profile (HASP).","The Three-Clinic Hearing Aid Selection Profile (HASP) was developed to assess a patient's beliefs about a number of basic considerations felt to be critical to the hearing aid selection (HAS) process. These characteristics are felt to be key to the acceptance of amplification and include motivation, expectations, cost of goods and services, appearance (cosmesis), attitudes about technology, physical function/limitations, communication needs, and lifestyle. The results of the first investigation suggest that we have been successful in developing a 40-item metric with adequate internal consistency reliability that assesses the aforementioned characteristics. Second, results of the administration of this tool to a large group of individuals indicated that (1) age impacted scores on the Technology, Physical Function, and Communicative Needs subscales; (2) gender impacted scores on the Motivation, Expectation, Technology, Communicative Needs, and Appearance subscales; (3) previous hearing aid use affected scores on the Motivation subscale; (4) level of education impacted scores on the Physical Function and Lifestyle subscales; and (5) self-perceived hearing handicap had an effect on Motivation and Communicative Needs subscale scores. Percentile data collected from this subject sample are presented as a benchmark against which to evaluate responses from individual patients. Case studies are presented to illustrate the potential clinical utility of this device."

"12166691","Behavioural awareness, interaction and counselling education in audiological rehabilitation: development of methods and application in a pilot study.","In conventional audiological rehabilitation, the hearing therapist interacts with the hearing-impaired person and with significant others. In order to strengthen the personality and self-confidence of the hearing-impaired individual, a different strategy was designed and implemented whereby the pedagogic interaction was directed only towards the hearing-impaired individual, who in turn worked as a tutor/aid/counsellor to the communication partner. On the basis of an interactive communication model, new methods for rehabilitation of subjects with moderate hearing impairment were developed and evaluated in a pilot study on 13 men with noise-induced hearing loss. A course programme was developed with three main active components: (1) increased insight and knowledge; (2) education as counsellors with the ability to focus on the problems of the communication partner; and (3) motivation to change through group discussion and reflexive conversation. Increased insight and knowledge were obtained through test and training experiences in a sound environmental chamber, tutorials and discussions. The pedagogic training focused on helping the hearing-impaired subjects to become able communication counsellors in relation to their interlocutors. An act-react, offensive-defensive paradigm was used in conjunction with transactional analysis. Results of the pilot study were evaluated using questionnaires, interviews and a method of dialogue analysis. The results were evaluated for the hearing-impaired and the partner and in recordings of conversations in the home environment. There were clearly positive cognitive and emotional effects seen in the inquiries and interviews. The observations from the dialogue analysis indicated only small effects, with the exception of the two individuals with the most pronounced functional impairment, for whom dialogue was improved after the course. It was concluded that these new methods could contribute new possibilities in rehabilitation programmes, emphasizing the shared responsibility for communication and the unique competence and abilities of the hearing-impaired person."
"12144203","Use of translation cards to increase communication with non-English-speaking families in the NICU.","Parents of infants in the neonatal intensive care unit report that communication with staff helps to relieve the many stresses they face. Particularly challenging for NICU nurses, however, is communication with non-English-speaking families. To improve this communication at Vanderbilt Children's Hospital in Nashville, illustrated cards have been developed to translate phrases commonly used in the nursery into foreign languages. Three different sets of cards provide translations in Spanish, Kurdish, and Serbo-Croatian (the languages most commonly encountered at this hospital), and a fourth set, in English, is used for individuals with hearing impairments. These cards aid the bedside nurse in giving a basic report and in encouraging parental participation in the infant's care. Nurses who have used the cards report that parents respond to the questions and seem to appreciate the attempt to communicate."
"12114142","Communication with deaf and hard-of-hearing people: a guide for medical education.","Some physicians may be insufficiently prepared to work with the many patients who have hearing loss. People with hearing loss constitute approximately 9% of the U.S. population, and the prevalence is increasing. Patients with hearing loss and their physicians report communication difficulties; physicians also report feeling less comfortable with these patients. Although communication with patients plays a major role in determining diagnoses and management, little attention is given to teaching medical students and residents the skills necessary to facilitate communication when hearing loss is involved. The need for these skills will increase with the expected rise in the number of such patients. The author presents the rationale for including information about hearing loss in curricula on patient-doctor communication, and suggests curricular content, including background regarding hearing loss and techniques that can enhance the physician's ability to listen to (that is, &quot;hear&quot;) and learn about the stories of these patients."
"11922150","Social characteristics, HIV/AIDS knowledge, preventive practices and risk factors elicitation among prisoners in Lagos, Nigeria.","BACKGROUND: Although many behavioral research studies and public enlightenment campaigns have been undertaken by both government and non-governmental organizations in the general public, no such study has been documented on prison inmates in Nigeria. This study aimed at documenting the social characteristics, HIV/AIDS knowledge and preventive practices of selected prisoners in Nigeria. It also elicited risk factors HIV/AIDS transmission in Nigeria prisons.METHODS: A cross-sectional study of prison inmates using an anonymous risk-factors identification questionnaire was undertaken in January 1997. The Kiri-kiri (maximum, medium and female) prisons were selected by balloting. Thereafter, two hundred and fifty two inmates were selected by systematic random sampling method using the full listing of all inmates as at the time of the survey. The study comprised of an interview session using a well structured questionnaire to seek information about their social data, their knowledge about HIV/AIDS including its transmission and preventive social data, and their indulgence in HIV/AIDS risky behaviour.RESULTS: The majority (53.6%) of the respondents were in the age group 20-29 years, 18 (7.1%) were less than 20 years old one of whom was in the maximum-security prison and three were females (table 1). The majority (52%) had secondary education while 9.9% had tertiary education and 7.1% had no formal education. About 97.2% of the study population had heard about AIDS although only 20.6% had known or seen someone with AIDS before and about 34.1% knew the causative agent of AIDS. 60.3% knew the correct mode of transmission of AIDS. 15.5% claimed fidelity and 12.7 % claimed use of condom for casual sexual contact, were measures that could help prevent AIDS but 7.9% did not know any preventive measure. Since hearing about AIDS, 59.5% claimed to have taken steps to protect themselves. 42.7% of the 89 who had not taken any protective steps against AIDS had no knowledge of how to protect themselves. About 56.3% claimed to have used condom before although only 38.7% used it for their last sexual exposure while 28.2% claimed they used it for all casual sexual intercourse. Many (42.8%) said they knew that homosexuality was the most prevalent sexual practice in the prison while 28.6% claimed there was no sexual practice and 13.1% feigned ignorance of any sexual practices in the prisons. Many (53.2%) claimed to have multiple sexual partners although 94.8% denied any sexual practice whilst still in prison.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that (i) almost all THE prisoners studied had heard of AIDS although only a few had seen or known a case of AIDS; (ii) despite the fact that many of them knew the correct modes of transmission, many indulged in high risk behaviours for AIDS transmission; (iii) there is a considerable proportion of receptive naïve inmates who stand the risk of being infected due to their high level of ignorance about HIV/AIDS. Well designed information, education and communication (IEC) programmes on AIDS with such formidable support structures as the provision of harm-reduction devices and risk-reduction counselling are urgently recommended for the Nigerian prisoners to effectively combat the imminent HIV/AIDS epidemic among the prison inmates."
"12940701","A brief history of audiology at Mayo Clinic.","Audiometric hearing tests were conducted at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester at the beginning of the 1930s. The list price for one of its audiometers at that time was 3,500 dollars, which translates into approximately 37,000 dollars in 2003 currency. Physicians and residents in training were responsible for conducting hearing tests in the 1930s and 1940s. In the early 1940s a registered nurse was trained as an audiometrist to assist for some of the audiometric testing. The first &quot;consulting audiologist&quot; at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester was hired in 1949, early in the development of audiology as a profession. Growth in demand for audiologic services for larger numbers of patients and in the variety of services provided to them led to marked increases in personnel, space, and specialization over the years."
"12918634","Beyond hearing aid fitting: improving communication for older adults.","Many older adults with hearing impairment continue to have substantial communication difficulties after being fitted with hearing aids, and many do not choose to wear hearing aids. Two group communication education programs aimed at such older people are described. The 'Keep on Talking' program has a health promotion focus, and is aimed at maintaining communication for older adults living in the community. An experimental group (n = 120) attended the program, and a control group (n = 130) received a communication assessment but no intervention. Significant improvements were found in the experimental participants in terms of knowledge about communication changes with age and about strategies to maintain communication skills. At the follow-up evaluation at 1 year, 45% of the experimental group, compared to 10% of the control group, had acted to improve their communication skills. The 'Active Communication Education' program focuses on the development of problem-solving strategies to improve communication in everyday life situations. Preliminary outcomes have been assessed on a small scale (n = 14) to date. It is concluded that communication programs represent an important adjunct to, or supplement for, the traditional approach that focuses on hearing aid fitting."
"12918629","Hearing aid rehabilitation: what do older people want, and what does the audiogram tell?","The demands/needs for audiological/otological services under optimal conditions were investigated within the framework of three epidemiological investigations. The study population consisted of 559 people, 318 women and 241 men, 70-91 years old. The participants were offered audiological and otological services, including hearing aid fitting. Fifteen per cent of the participants asked for audiological/otological services. Six per cent of the participants were equipped with hearing aids as a result of the study. Almost all of those with severe hearing loss either had been equipped with hearing aids prior to the study, or took advantage of the offer to get such devices. This figure represented about half of those with moderate hearing loss and about 20% of those with mild hearing loss. After the study, 19% were equipped with hearing aids, but in all 25% had hearing aids or had expressed a wish to get one. The percentages of elderly people with mild-to-moderate hearing loss, who contemplated purchasing an aid, but did not do so, were large, between 10%, and 22%. More than 11% consulted a doctor when the opportunity was offered to them. Most of them wanted the consultation because of progressive hearing loss. Middle ear disease was another important reason for a consultation."
"12739851","Enhancing literacy development through AAC technologies.","There is a critical need to understand teaching and technology supports that enable students who use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems to engage in meaningful literacy experiences and foster conventional literacy skills. To thrive in classroom environments, they must have access to tools that can support them in active and independent literacy learning. These students need technology that allows them to move seamlessly between reading, writing, and communicating. They require technology that takes into account access needs, individual learning needs, the learning demands of technology, and literacy development across grades. Families and school teams need information that will assist them in providing the best tools and the most appropriate content within these tools throughout the school day. Teachers need information that supports them in providing exemplary literacy instruction to students who use AAC systems. This article explores and summarizes factors impacting literacy learning, including literacy capabilities of school-age students who use AAC, communication in literacy learning and use, reading and writing instruction in general education classrooms, and technology to support literacy learning. It is important that future technology tools provide a platform for levels of literacy learning: The power of technology will be reflected in its ability to provide access to and display the right content at the right time for students who use AAC. This article summarizes current factors thought to influence literacy learning and discusses priorities for future research and technology development."
"12696853","Risk factors for animal-related injury among Iowa large-livestock farmers: a case-control study nested in the Agricultural Health Study.","CONTEXT: Although farmers are at risk for injuries from contact with large livestock, few previous studies have examined risk factors for animal-related injuries.PURPOSE: This case-control study, nested in the Agricultural Health Study, aimed to assess risk factors for animal-related injury among Iowa large-livestock farmers.METHODS: A screener questionnaire sent to 6999 farmers identified 116 farmers with large livestock who had an animal-related injury requiring medical advice/treatment in the previous year. Several possible risk factors for injury were assessed by comparing these farmers with 342 farmers who had livestock but were not injured in the previous year.FINDINGS: A multiple logistic regression analysis showed significant associations between animal-related injury and the use of a hearing aid (odds ratio [OR] = 5.4 [95% CI, 1.6 to 18.0]), doctor-diagnosed arthritis or rheumatism (OR = 3.0 [95% CI, 1.7 to 5.2]), education beyond high school (OR = 1.8 [95% CI, 1.1 to 2.8]), and a younger age. Farmers engaged in off-farm work were less likely to sustain animal-related injuries (OR = 0.4 [95% CI, 0.2 to 0.8]).CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show associations between animal-related injury and a younger age, hearing difficulties, and doctor-diagnosed arthritis. Hearing loss and arthritis, which are more common among farmers than among other workers, may be particularly important risk factors to address in future preventive studies."
"12673912","Risk factors for agricultural injury: a case-control analysis of Iowa farmers in the Agricultural Health Study.","The purpose of this case-control study nested in the Agricultural Health Study was to assess risk factors for agricultural injury among a large group of Iowa farmers. A questionnaire sent to 6,999 farmers identified 431 cases who had a farm work-related injury requiring medical advice/treatment in the previous year and 473 controls who had no injury in the previous year. We assessed several potential risk factors for injury. A multiple logistic regression analysis showed significant associations between farm work-related injury and weekly farming work hours (&gt; or = 50 hours/week) (OR = 1.65; 95% CI = 1.23-2.21), the presence of large livestock (OR = 1.77; 95% CI = 1.24-2.51), education beyond high school (OR = 1.61; 95% CI = 1.21-2.12), regular medication use (OR = 1.44; 95% CI = 1.04-1.96), wearing a hearing aid (OR = 2.36; 95% CI = 1.07-5.20), and younger age.

Of men aware of N-9, 83% (289/349) knowingly used it in their lifetime, of which 67% (193/289) used it during anal intercourse in the previous year. Forty-one percent (79/193) of those who used N-9 during anal intercourse in the past year did so without a condom because they thought it may protect against HIV. Older men were more likely than younger men to have used N-9 for protection. Men who heard that N-9 may not protect were less likely, and African-Americans (versus Caucasians) were more likely, to say they would definitely use N-9 during anal intercourse in the future. Latinos (versus Caucasians), those with unknown HIV serostatus (versus HIV-negative), and those with lower education were less likely to know about N-9 at all, and thus were at risk for unknowingly using N-9.CONCLUSIONS: Many MSM used N-9 during or following public health warnings about the product. Actions (e.g., information campaigns, warning labels specific to rectal use) should be considered by communities to reduce rectal use of N-9."
"12592803","The effectiveness of an intervention program on hearing aid maintenance for teenagers and their teachers.","The impact of an intervention program on hearing aid functioning and maintenance was evaluated. The program targeted 29 teenagers who wore hearing aids, and 7 of their teachers. Using an A-B-A paradigm, the researcher monitored student and clinician reports on the hearing aids' functioning over a 12-week period that began before intervention and concluded 3 weeks after intervention ended. Pretest and posttest student and teacher questionnaires tapped these two groups' knowledge and attitudes concerning hearing aids. The 6-week intervention comprised theoretical and practical instruction in hearing aid maintenance. The number of functioning hearing aids increased significantly following intervention, and continued to increase even after intervention ended. The gap between student and clinician reports on the functional status of the hearing aids was widest in the study's first stage and narrowest--indeed, negligible--in the third. The questionnaire results indicated that both students and teachers acquired new knowledge. The study findings underscore the need for intervention programs in hearing aid maintenance and their benefits to adolescent students and their teachers."
"12585219","Reducing HIV sexual risk among African American women who use drugs: hearing their voices.","A pilot study was conducted to understand women's realities, perspectives, and perceived needs regarding the interaction between substance use, types of sexual relationships, and the challenges and barriers they pose to practicing safer sex. An additional purpose was to examine this population's willingness to participate in the program and receptiveness to the components of proposed interventions. Data were collected in this descriptive, exploratory study by the use of one focus group. Twelve African American women between 20 and 55 years of age who had previous drug detoxification experience participated in a 3-hour focus group. All participants were sexually active as well as current users of illicit substances, and all but one had traded sex for money, drugs, or alcohol. The focus group interview was guided by a semistructured questionnaire. Participants were recruited by counselors in detoxification units. Each unit counselor was asked to randomly select a third of their residents, explain and read the purpose of the focus group, and get the residents' verbal consent to participate. The women discussed their sexual behaviors and drug use that increased their risk for acquiring HIV. They provided insight about the effects of different drugs on one's sexual behavior, motivation for sex, and reasons for unsafe sex and made recommendations for HIV prevention intervention. Participants agreed that safer sex and healthy living intervention would be most beneficial if placed within the context of a detoxification program. The juxtaposition of increased sexual risk behavior and the potential to acquire and transmit HIV infection suggests the urgency of intervening with African American women who are substance abusers."
"15585749","Self-esteem and coping strategies among deaf students.","Research studies on the determinants of self-esteem of deaf individuals often yield inconsistent findings. The current study assessed the effects on self-esteem of factors related to deafness, such as the means of communication at home and severity of hearing loss with hearing aid, as well as the coping styles that deaf people adopt to cope with everyday life in a hearing world. Data were collected among the deaf students of California State University, Northridge. Hierarchical regression modeling showed that identification with the Deaf community significantly contributed to positive self-esteem. Results also revealed that deaf students with greater degree of hearing loss and with bicultural skills that help them function in both the hearing and the Deaf community generally have higher self-esteem. Implications for further study are discussed."
"15579861","Vibrotactile speech tracking support: cognitive prerequisites.","Fourteen postlingually hearing-impaired participants took part in an intervention study on the potential benefit of three types of tactile aids (i.e., the Tactilator, Minivib 3, and the Tactaid 7). Although training by means of computerized tracking had substantial effects on speech tracking rate, no differential effects of type of aid emerged. However, a cognitive test battery revealed that training efficacy is directly dependent on the cognitive prerequisites of the individual speechreader. The speed with which an individual can make phonological judgments (i.e., rhyme judgments) and visual word decoding from lipreading proved to be critical cognitive skills. We conclude that these skills must be further assessed and taken into account when rehabilitation/training programs are launched."

Without careful consideration, distance education could become learning anytime, anywhere, but not for anybody. It is not only unethical, but also illegal to ignore the special needs of these learners. The specific impact of such legislation on distance education for those students with hearing impairments will be addressed. Students with disabilities are often faced with a double digital divide that must be bridged. Universal design uses an excellent proactive approach to closing this digital divide caused by inaccessible courses. Each medium of transmission in distance education poses unique access barriers. Even within the same medium, what is best for one student or class may not be the most ideal accommodation in another situation. Individualized accommodation methods will be examined, and specific technologies and software will be discussed."

"15513726","Effects of synthetic speech output in the learning of graphic symbols of varied iconicity.","PURPOSE: To examine the effects of additional auditory feedback from synthetic speech on the learning of high translucent symbols versus low translucent symbols.METHOD: Two adults with little or no functional speech and severe intellectual disabilities served as participants. A single-subject ABACA/ACABA design was used to study the relative effects of two treatments: symbol training in the presence and absence of synthetic speech output.RESULTS: The results clearly indicated that the two treatments, rather than extraneous variables were responsible for gains in the symbol learning. Both participants learned either more low translucent symbols or reached their maximum learning of low translucent symbols in the speech output condition.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this preliminary study replicate and extend the iconicity hypothesis to a new set of learning conditions involving speech output, and suggest that feedback from speech output may assist adults with profound intellectual disabilities in coding particularly those symbols whose association with their referent cannot be coded via their visual resemblance with the referent."
"15332464","Issues in the school-to-work transition of hard of hearing adolescents.","Career theorists emphasize the importance of the development of career maturity in adolescents if they are to successfully negotiate the school-to-work transition. Transitions of deaf and hard of hearing adolescents may be especially problematic. The authors examine the implications of current labor market trends for young people, in particular those with hearing loss, and review data on employment outcomes for deaf and hard of hearing people. They discuss the environmental and attitudinal barriers that can influence the career outcomes of this population, consider the impact of hearing loss on adolescents' career maturity, and review the studies on this topic in the literature. The article focuses on the experiences of students with significant hearing loss who are educated in regular classes with the support of itinerant teachers, who communicate orally, and who may be defined as hard of hearing. Recommendations for research and practice are provided."

The aim of this study was to explore this relationship in a group of adults infected with HIV/AIDS attending an outpatient clinic in a hospital located in Gauteng, South Africa. The prevalence of hearing loss; the type, degree and configuration of the hearing loss; the relationship between the hearing symptoms and the progressive stages of the disease, and the type of onset of hearing problems were examined. The results of the study indicated a prevalence rate of hearing loss which was as high as 23% in the sample surveyed. The types of hearing loss included conductive and sensorineural, while the degree of severity ranged from slight to profound in nature. The configuration of the hearing loss was not frequency-range-specific, and the degree of severity did not seem to worsen with the progression of the HIV/AIDS disease. However, there did seem to be an increase in the occurrence of sensorineural hearing loss with the deterioration of patients' immunological status. Analysis of patients' audiological results along with their case history data suggested that their hearing loss may have been caused by opportunistic infections and/or their treatments. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for the clinical management of patients with HIV/AIDS; education of team members; and policy formulation."
"14760980","Stroke rehabilitation: assistive technology devices and environmental modifications following primary rehabilitation in hospital--a therapeutic perspective.","The aim of this article is to describe the need for assistive devices and environmental modifications among long-living stroke survivors and to investigate if the need is continued and growing over time. The study sample of 155 consecutive stroke patients with stroke-related impairment, discharged home from three hospitals in Copenhagen from 1996 through 1998, constituted 20% of the total population of stroke survivors in this area. The results showed that 75% of these patients were provided with assistive devices and/or environmental modifications at discharge. Six months after discharge the proportion was 81%. The aids most frequently prescribed were bath seats, aids for mobility, grab bars, and removal of door thresholds. At follow-up 3-5 years later, 74% of the survivors were seen (76 patients). Almost all of the survivors were dependent on assistive devices and/or environmental modifications, most frequently wheelchairs and aids for walking and bathing. In addition there was a significant increase in aids for cooking/eating and reading/hearing/writing adaptations. Of those devices abandoned, most were aids for the household. These findings suggest that home visits by therapists should be required in order to target stroke survivors' changing needs for assistive devices and environmental modifications."
"14748551","Should significant others be encouraged to join adult group audiologic rehabilitation classes?","The benefit of participation in group audiologic rehabilitation classes was examined for adults with hearing loss (subjects) and their significant others (SOs). Thirteen subjects attended the classes with their SOs, and 12 subjects attended the classes on their own. All subjects attended six 90-minute classes consisting of informational lectures, and training in communication strategies, auditory perception, and auditory and visual perception. Self-assessment scales measuring hearing aid benefit and use of communication strategies were completed prior to class participation and following the completion of all classes. The results indicated that the majority of subjects reported increased use of communication strategies following class participation. In addition, a significant reduction in hearing handicap following class participation was measured across all subjects and SOs, and the greatest reduction in handicap was measured for subjects who attended the classes with their SOs. SO participation in group AR (audiologic rehabilitation) classes should be encouraged."
"14735682","Understanding and responding to patients' requests for assistance in dying.","PURPOSE: To explore how nurses experience and respond to patients' requests for assistance in dying (AID).DESIGN AND METHODS: A phenomenological study of 10 self-selected nurses.FINDINGS: Four major themes: Being Open to Hear and Hearing; Interpreting and Responding to the Meaning; Responding to Persistent Requests for AID, and Reflections. When faced with persistent requests for AID, participants provided a continuum of interventions: refusal, providing palliative care that might secondarily hasten dying, respecting and not interfering with patients' or families' plans to hasten dying, and providing varying types and degrees of direct AID. Their responses were context-driven rather than rule-mandated, and they drew a distinction between secondarily hastening and directly causing death.CONCLUSIONS: Few nurses in this study unequivocally agreed or refused to directly help a patient die. Most struggled alone and in silence to find a morally and legally acceptable way to help patients who persisted in requesting AID. Regardless of how they responded, many described feelings of conflict, guilt, and moral distress."
"16343355","A health policy for hearing impairment in older Australians: what should it include?","BACKGROUND: As in all western countries, Australia's older population experiences high levels of hearing impairment coupled with relatively low levels of hearing device usage. Poor hearing diminishes the quality of life of affected individuals and their families. This paper discusses how to improve Australian hearing health policies in order to better combat this impairment amongst older Australians.METHOD: We searched the databases Medline, Meditext and Web of Science to find articles that discussed strategies and innovations to assist the hearing health of older people, and related this material to observations made during the Blue Mountains Hearing Study in NSW between 1997 and 2003.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The literature search identified five areas for inclusion in a comprehensive hearing health policy in Australia. These are: early intervention; addressing of hearing aid expense; the use of assisted listening devices; hearing rehabilitation, and; screening and education. Further research in Australia is critical if we are to develop a strong approach to the increasing prevalence of age-related hearing loss.CONCLUSION: Australia needs to act now to address hearing impairment as it is a major cause of disability in those aged 55 and over. Federal and State governments should collaborate to construct a comprehensive hearing health policy that tackles poor levels of hearing health through early intervention, addressing hearing aid expense, encouraging the use of assisted listening devices, rehabilitation, screening and education. A good start would be to declare age related hearing impairment as a National Health Priority Area."
"16342421","Condom use among brothel-based sex workers and clients in Bali, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: The objective of this paper is to describe the situation among Indonesian sex workers and clients in Bali, Indonesia, through a series of studies conducted during the 1990s.METHODS: Five surveys of sex workers and clients were conducted from 1992 through to 1999.RESULTS: The proportion of female sex workers who have heard about AIDS and condom use has increased tremendously in this area. In 1992-93, 51% of women reported ever hearing of AIDS and this had increased to 97% by 1999 (P &lt; 0.01). Reported condom use with clients increased from 19% in 1992-93 to 78% in 1999 (P &lt; 0.01). However, condom use is still far from 100% and perceived susceptibility towards HIV infection among female sex workers and their male clients remains low. Ineffective preventive strategies such as medication use remain common. HIV infection was very low in this population, although the prevalence of other sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia was very high.CONCLUSIONS: Educational interventions have been conducted with the sex workers, but the main source of education for clients has been through the media. Future programs need to develop more focused efforts to reach clients. These interventions may include worksite interventions, mass media campaigns, youth programs or other models."
"16180973","Recognition of hearing aid orientation content by first-time users.","PURPOSE: To examine how well hearing aid orientation (HAO) content is remembered immediately and 1 month after the HAO, and whether the ability to remember this information differs as a function of the audiologist providing the information, patient's age, degree of hearing loss, and prior knowledge of hearing aids.METHOD: A convenience sample of 100 older adults completed a multiple-choice test of hearing aid knowledge immediately following the HAO and 1 month later. Covariate and regression analyses were used to address the study purpose.RESULTS: On average, participants recognized 74% of the information immediately following HAO and 78% at 1 month. Hearing loss was associated with declining recognition for hearing aid use and care information immediately following HAO, whereas prior knowledge was associated with successful recognition. Participants who recognized more HAO content immediately also remembered more at 1 month. A difference in recognition of hearing aid information based on audiologist was suggested immediately following HAO, but there were no differences at 1 month. Ability to recognize HAO content was not related to age of participants.CONCLUSIONS: On average, participants recognized approximately 75% of the HAO content, which is encouraging from a clinical standpoint, providing support for the efficacy of the HAO and the time audiologists spend in completing it. Moreover, recognition of HAO content improved when tested at 1 month, suggesting audiologists may expect their patients to be aware of a majority of hearing aid use and care information following the hearing aid trial period."
"16180968","Clinical guide for audiologic tinnitus management I: Assessment.","PURPOSE: This article is the first of 2 that present basic guidelines for audiologists to provide clinical management of tinnitus. The method, termed audiologic tinnitus management (ATM), was developed to incorporate management strategies that can be implemented most efficiently by audiologists.METHOD: Development of ATM has been drawn from the clinical and research experience of the authors and numerous audiologists. Certain elements of ATM are adapted from the methods of tinnitus masking and tinnitus retraining therapy. Procedures are described in the present article for performing the intake assessment, while the companion article (J. A. Henry, T. L. Zaugg, &amp; M. A. Schechter, 2005) describes treatment methodology.RESULTS: Development of ATM has resulted in defined procedures to conduct a basic tinnitus assessment that includes written questionnaires, an intake interview, audiologic evaluation, and a psychoacoustic assessment of tinnitus perceptual characteristics. If patients report a sound tolerance problem (hyperacusis), loudness discomfort levels are measured at audiometric frequencies. There are special procedures for selecting hearing aids, ear-level noise generators, combination devices (noise generator and hearing aid combined), and personal listening devices (i.e., portable radios and tape, CD, and MP3 players).CONCLUSIONS: This article explains each of these assessment components in detail. Adoption of the ATM assessment protocol by audiologists can contribute to the establishment of uniform procedures for the clinical management of tinnitus patients."
"16028788","A home education program for older adults with hearing impairment and their significant others: a randomized trial evaluating short- and long-term effects.","This paper addresses the development and effectiveness of a home education program. The program, designed for hearing-impaired elders and their significant others (SO), deals with communication strategies and speech reading. Participants were randomly assigned to a training group (hearing aid fitting+home education program) or a control group (hearing aid fitting). The training group included 24 hearing-impaired subjects and 24 SO's. Controls were 24 affected individuals and 22 SO's. Questionnaires addressing emotional response, communication strategies and the IOI-HA, IOI-AI and IOI-SO were used. A repeated measures analysis of variance was applied to test group differences between pre, post, and 6-months follow-up measures. Increased awareness of benefits of speech reading and improved interaction with the SO were observed in the training group only (p &lt; 0.05). No group difference on 'emotional response' was found. IOI-AI and IOI-SO demonstrated favorable attitudes towards the program. Follow-up measures showed improved quality of life and satisfaction in the training group, while a decrease was observed among the controls (p &lt; 0.05). Some effects differed between first-time and experienced hearing aid users. Addition of services to amplification and involvement of the SO are relevant in aural rehabilitation."
"15813656","Assessing medication adherence in the elderly: which tools to use in clinical practice?","Adherence to prescribed medication regimens is difficult for all patients and particularly challenging for the elderly. Medication adherence demands a working relationship between a patient or caregiver and prescriber that values open, honest discussion about medications, i.e. the administration schedule, intended benefits, adverse effects and costs. Although nonadherence to medications may be common among the elderly, fundamental reasons leading to nonadherence vary among patients. Demographic characteristics may help to identify elderly patients who are at risk for nonadherence. Inadequate or marginal health literacy among the elderly is common and warrants assessment. The number of co-morbid conditions and presence of cognitive, vision and/or hearing impairment may predispose the elderly to nonadherence. Similarly, medications themselves may contribute to nonadherence secondary to adverse effects or costs. Especially worrisome is nonadherence to 'less forgiving' drugs that, when missed, may lead to an adverse event (e.g. withdrawal symptoms) or disease exacerbation. Traditional methods for assessing medication adherence are unreliable. Direct questioning at the patient interview may not provide accurate assessments, especially if closed-ended, judgmental questions are posed. Prescription refill records and pill counts often overestimate true adherence rates. However, if elders are asked to describe how they take their medicines (using the Drug Regimen Unassisted Grading Scale or MedTake test tools), adherence problems can be identified in a non-threatening manner. Medication nonadherence should be suspected in elders who experience a decline in functional abilities. Predictors of medication nonadherence include specific disease states, such as cardiovascular diseases and depression. Technological aids to assessing medication adherence are available, but their utility is, thus far, primarily limited to a few research studies. These computerised devices, which assess adherence to oral and inhaled medications, may offer insight into difficult medication management problems. The most practical method of medication adherence assessment for most elderly patients may be through patient or caregiver interview using open-ended, non-threatening and non-judgmental questions."
"17162476","Risk factors for low back injury among farmers in Iowa: A case-control study nested in the agricultural health study.","The aim of this study was to assess risk factors for low back injury requiring medical advice or treatment among Iowa farmers. Although farmers are at risk for low back injury, few studies have addressed risk factors for farm work-related low back injury. We screened 6999 participants in the Iowa portion of the Agricultural Health Study to identify 49 male farmers who reported farm work-related low back injury requiring medical advice or treatment in the previous year. We compared them with 465 uninjured male farmer controls. Multivariable modeling identified four risk factors significantly associated with low back injury: age less than 45 years (OR = 3.32; 95% CI 1.75-6.20), doctor-diagnosed asthma (OR = 4.26; 95% CI 1.49-12.10), education beyond high school (OR = 2.12; 95% CI 1.13-3.90), and difficulty hearing normal conversation (even with a hearing aid, in the case of those using one) (OR = 1.98; 95% CI 1.02-3.80). Although hearing difficulty may be a general risk factor for occupational injury, asthma may be a more specific risk factor for low back injury. Future research to assess the risk factors, asthma and difficulty hearing, may be particularly important, since farmers are at increased risk for hearing loss, and farmers come into contact with many inhaled agents that can cause asthma."
"17148872","User needs evaluation of workplace accommodations.","This study examined the multi-faceted issues surrounding workplace accommodation for workers with disabilities. A user needs survey of 510 disabled individuals examined the types of technology and accommodations needed to perform work and employment-related activities. Workers with disabilities used a variety of workplace accommodations to overcome difficulties with functional limitations. Some differences existed in the types of accommodations used by older and younger workers who had the same functional limitation. Workers of all ages were not likely to report mental limitations, and those who did were not likely to utilize workplace accommodations, with the exception of some memory strategies. For those with hearing loss, younger workers used sign language more frequently, while pre-retirement and retirement age workers used more hearing aids. Working age adults with vision impairments used electronic documents, Braille, and CCTVs more than pre-retirement or retirement age workers. Regardless of age, workers reporting functional limitations often received no workplace accommodations."
"17134797","Enhanced sensory recovery after median nerve repair using cortical audio-tactile interaction. A randomised multicentre study.","The &quot;Sensor Glove System&quot; offers an alternate afferent inflow from the hand early after nerve repair in the forearm, mediated through the hearing sense, implying that deprivation of one sense can be compensated by another sense. This sensory &quot;by-pass&quot; was used early after repair of the median nerve with the intention of improving recovery of functional sensibility by maintaining an active sensory map of the hand in the somatosensory cortex during the deafferentation period. In a prospective multicentre clinical study, one group (n=14) started early after surgery with sensory re-education using the Sensor Glove System and the control group (n=12) received conventional sensory re-education, starting 3 months postoperatively. The patients were checked regularly during a 1-year period, with focus on recovery of tactile gnosis. After 12, months, tactile gnosis was significantly better in the Sensor Glove System group. This highlights the timing for introduction of training after nerve repair, focusing on the importance of immediate sensory re-learning."
"17125575","Can self assessment of communication predict hearing loss?","A total of 120 subjects with hearing loss (75 men, 45 women), within the age range 18-70 years (mean, 38 years), and 15 normal subjects were administered a modified Hindi adaptation of the 'self assessment of communication' hearing loss inventory. The study aimed to determine whether there was any correlation between subjects' average pure tone thresholds and their inventory scores. Data was analysed using the Pearson coefficient of correlation and regression analysis. A negative correlation was obtained stating that the greater the hearing loss, the lower the inventory score. An equation could also be derived for the bilateral symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss group and the bilateral symmetrical conductive hearing loss group to enable calculation of patients' average hearing loss from their inventory scores, in the absence of an audiogram. This could aid rehabilitation in cases with either type of hearing loss (in which no medical intervention was required) when pure tone audiometry is not possible."

Factors deemed most important by six focus groups were included in a 106-question survey that was returned by 275 ASHA Special Interest Division #12 (AAC) members. Factor analysis indicated the constructs of Support, Attitude, and System characteristics and Fit as most important to the long-term success of AAC systems. The constructs of Not Maintaining/Adjusting the System, Attitude, Lack of Training, Lack of Support, and Poor Fit were most often related to inappropriate abandonment of AAC systems. Systematic implementation of intervention targeting the constructs is recommended."
"17106349","HIV/AIDS and disability: a pilot survey of HIV/AIDS knowledge among a deaf population in Swaziland.","This study sought to establish whether there were measurable differences in the level of knowledge about HIV/AIDS between hearing individuals and individuals who identified themselves as deaf sign language users in Swaziland. A cross-sectional survey of 191 rural and urban hearing and deaf adults was undertaken in Swaziland in December 2003. A structured questionnaire was administered, seeking to establish whether there were statistically significant differences between hearing and deaf populations in their level of knowledge about HIV/AIDS symptoms, transmission and prevention, as well as differences in sources of information about HIV/AIDS. Additional questions were asked regarding whether there were differences in accessibility of HIV testing services and HIV/AIDS-related healthcare for the two groups. Significant differences in levels of knowledge about HIV/AIDS were identified between the hearing and deaf respondents. The deaf population was significantly more likely (P&lt;0.05) to believe in incorrect modes of HIV transmission (e.g. hugging and airborne transmission) and HIV prevention (e.g. avoiding sharing utensils and eating healthy foods). Almost all of the deaf respondents (99%) reported difficulties in communicating with healthcare facility staff, which may result in less use of HIV voluntary counseling and testing services. This paper reports the results of this study, and discusses the need for targeted HIV/AIDS education campaigns and improved accessibility in healthcare facilities for deaf sign language users in countries such as Swaziland."
"17101935","Effectiveness of nonpharmacological interventions for the management of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with dementia: a systematic review.","BACKGROUND: Recent reports documenting limited evidence supporting the use of pharmacological interventions for neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) and increased risk of death, the black box warnings against the use of atypical antipsychotic drugs in older adults, and Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act regulations suggest the need to evaluate the usefulness of nonpharmacological interventions in the management of NPS of dementia.METHODS: To determine the evidence base of nonpharmacological interventions for the management of NPS in patients with dementia, we reviewed MEDLINE, PsycINFO, the Cochrane library, and relevant bibliographies published from January 1966 to December 2005, using the American Psychological Association Guidelines.RESULTS: Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 6 single-case designs (SCDs; N of 1 trials) met inclusion criteria. Under unmet needs interventions, 1 SCD found a moderate reduction in problem behaviors. Under behavioral interventions, based on observational data, all 4 SCDs reported a relative reduction of 50% to 100% in neuropsychiatric symptoms. Under caregiving interventions, there were 3 RCTs. At the 6-month follow-up, 1 RCT found a reduction in 4 neuropsychiatric symptom subscales: ideation disturbance score (0.3 vs 0.5; range, 0-8; P = .005); irritability score (18.8 vs 23.0; range, 8-38; P = .008); verbal agitation, as measured by mean frequency of 20-minute outbursts (0.5 vs 0.8; P = .005); and physical aggression score (11.4 vs 12.9; range, 6-42; P&lt;.001). Another RCT found a significant improvement in frequency (2.3 vs 3.1; range, 0-4; P&lt;.001) and severity (2.2 vs 2.8; range, 0-4; P&lt;.001) of target behaviors associated with the intervention arm. The third RCT found no effect. Under bright light therapy, 1 SCD found short-term improvements on the Agitated Behavior Rating Scale (9.7 vs 19.9; P&lt;.001).CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative research to date on the impact of nonpharmacologic interventions for NPS among patients with dementia indicates that interventions that address behavioral issues and unmet needs and that include caregivers or bright light therapy may be efficacious. More high-quality research is necessary to confirm these findings."
"17079528","Computer-assisted instruction: a survey on the attitudes of osteopathic medical students.","OBJECTIVES: To investigate the views of osteopathic medical students on their preferred learning methods, their current use of computers as an educational tool, and their attitudes regarding the role of computers in medical education, based on their skill level.METHODS: A 27-item questionnaire was distributed to first-through fourth-year osteopathic medical students. Items asked students to assess their levels of computer skills and experience, their current use of computers as an educational tool, and their attitudes regarding the role of computers in medical education.RESULTS: Of the 246 students (80% of enrolled students) who responded to the questionnaire, a majority (129 [53%]) rated themselves as having intermediate computer skills, and the remaining students rated their skills as basic (69 [28%]) or advanced (46 [19%]). Most students (176 [72%]) felt that they learned best by both hearing and seeing or reading new material, that they learned more easily from a printed page than a computer screen, and that live lectures provided them with the best opportunity for learning. However, when compared with students who have basic and intermediate computer skills, students with advanced computer skills were more in favor of computer-assisted instruction and testing as well as a school requirement to own a computer and to use a laptop computer in class.CONCLUSIONS: Students' opinions of the importance of computer technology in medical education seem to be based mainly on their self-assessed technical competency levels. Understanding this dynamic may aid medical educators in the implementation of computer-assisted instruction."
"16999250","The need for and development of an adaptive Listening and Communication Enhancement (LACE) Program.","Auditory training has long been advocated to enhance communication but has never been time or cost-effective. This article describes the concepts underlying the development of a home-based, interactive adaptive computer program designed to engage the adult hearing-impaired listener in the hearing-aid-fitting process, provide listening strategies, build confidence, and address cognitive changes characteristic of the aging process. An investigation using a between-group, within-subject design with pre- and post-test objective and subjective measures was conducted at five clinical sites. Sixty-five subjects were randomly placed into two groups, one receiving LACE (Listening and Communication Enhancement) immediately following baseline testing and one serving as a control for one month and then receiving training as a crossover group. Results showed statistically significant improvements for the trained subjects on all but one of the outcome measures. Barriers facing the widespread implementation of home-based aural rehabilitation are discussed."

This is true not only in the field of audiology, but also in all healthcare professions. Typically, evidence-based practice (EBP) is assimilated from a combination of a systematic review of current practices, practitioner experience, academic training and ongoing continuing education through review of journals, textbooks and attendance at meetings as well as informal discussions with colleagues. Clinicians are inundated with information from these sources, and they need to extract the necessary information and apply it to their specific patient population. Evidence-based practice as it applies to the non-medical treatment of hearing loss (with hearing aids) will be discussed. In addition, several studies based on clinical observations are presented for discussion."

This study investigated parents' compliance for accessing services for their infants at 5 levels in the process from referrals through subsequent follow-up during a 3-year period. Compliance was defined as parents' follow-through with professionals' recommendations and appointments for their infants' hearing health care.METHOD: Investigators retrospectively reviewed the charts of 51 infants who were referred from a regional hospital's newborn hearing screening program to a private practice office and were seen from March 2000 to February 2003.RESULTS: Compliance was 100% for initial hospital inpatient screening and for outpatient rescreening but decreased throughout the referral process. All of the parents of babies with hearing loss complied, and their infants were diagnosed by age 3 months and received audiologic or otologic intervention by age 6 months. Only half of those who needed and opted for hearing aids complied and began habilitative intervention by age 6 months.CONCLUSIONS: Although compliance for initial and follow-up screening was excellent and met goals for national benchmarks, compliance for intervention services showed room for improvement."
"16707300","An evaluation of digital, split-site and traditional formats in conference poster sessions.","The paper reports an evaluation of digital, split-site and traditional poster presentations at the Association for Medical Education in Europe (AMEE) conference in September 2004. The programme included 300 posters in 19 sessions, viewed, potentially, by 1265 conference participants, in parallel with other events. The instrument was a questionnaire of 16 open- and closed-format questions applied opportunistically and gaining 250 complete responses. Qualitative and quantitative analysis suggested that no one format was preferred. Each had different strengths and weaknesses relating to seeing and hearing the presenter and viewing the poster. Opportunities for discussion were highly valued."
"16687453","Effects of presentation method on the understanding of informed consent.","AIM: Knowledge of which presentation methods impart the most information to patients can improve the informed consent discussion. The purpose of this study was to determine if the comprehension and recall of the informed consent discussion varied with presentation method.METHODS: Randomised, prospective study at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. 90 freshmen medical students were randomly assigned to one of three groups and separately went through an informed consent on cataract surgery. Group A heard an informed consent presentation. Group B was shown diagrams while hearing the same presentation. Group C heard the consent and then watched an informational video on cataract surgery. A 10 point multiple choice quiz was administered after the presentation and repeated again 1 week later.RESULTS: Scores from each group were averaged as number correct out of 10 questions. For same day scores, group C scores (7.70 (SD 1.24)) were significantly higher than group A (6.39 (1.63)). One week testing revealed that group C (6.96 (1.62)) recalled more between the two time periods and scored significantly higher than groups A (5.15 (2.11)) and B (5.54 (1.64)).CONCLUSIONS: This study found differences in the participants' ability to recall facts based on the manner in which the material was presented. It clearly demonstrated that the use of visual aids improved the ability to remember facts and risks associated with cataract surgery beyond a verbal presentation alone. It also showed a benefit of the repetition of information as provided by audiovisual presentations that can be used in conjunction with the physician-patient discussion."
"16684705","Measuring outcomes of a communication program for older people with hearing impairment using the International Outcome Inventory.","The main objective of this study was to describe the outcomes of a communication education program for older people with hearing impairment using the International Outcome Inventory--Alternative Interventions (IOI-AI) and the version for significant others (IOI-AI-SO). Ninety-six people aged 58 to 94 years participated in an interactive group education program for two hours per week for five weeks. The IOI-AI was administered at one to two weeks after the last educational session and 29 significant others also completed the IOI-AI-SO at this time. Overall, positive results were obtained using both questionnaires, and satisfaction with the program was particularly high. Findings also compared favourably to reports of outcomes for other audiological interventions (i.e., another communication training program and hearing aid fitting). Principal components analysis of the IOI-AI revealed a somewhat different factor structure than the original IOI-HA. The two versions of the IOI applied in this study are recommended as simple and effective measures of the outcomes of alternative interventions."
"16672795","Effect of training on word-recognition performance in noise for young normal-hearing and older hearing-impaired listeners.","OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a training program for hearing-impaired listeners to improve their speech-recognition performance within a background noise when listening to amplified speech. Both noise-masked young normal-hearing listeners, used to model the performance of elderly hearing-impaired listeners, and a group of elderly hearing-impaired listeners participated in the study. Of particular interest was whether training on an isolated word list presented by a standardized talker can generalize to everyday speech communication across novel talkers.DESIGN: Word-recognition performance was measured for both young normal-hearing (n = 16) and older hearing-impaired (n = 7) adults. Listeners were trained on a set of 75 monosyllabic words spoken by a single female talker over a 9- to 14-day period. Performance for the familiar (trained) talker was measured before and after training in both open-set and closed-set response conditions. Performance on the trained words of the familiar talker were then compared with those same words spoken by three novel talkers and to performance on a second set of untrained words presented by both the familiar and unfamiliar talkers. The hearing-impaired listeners returned 6 mo after their initial training to examine retention of the trained words as well as their ability to transfer any knowledge gained from word training to sentences containing both trained and untrained words.RESULTS: Both young normal-hearing and older hearing-impaired listeners performed significantly better on the word list in which they were trained versus a second untrained list presented by the same talker. Improvements on the untrained words were small but significant, indicating some generalization to novel words. The large increase in performance on the trained words, however, was maintained across novel talkers, pointing to the listener's greater focus on lexical memorization of the words rather than a focus on talker-specific acoustic characteristics. On return in 6 mo, listeners performed significantly better on the trained words relative to their initial baseline performance. Although the listeners performed significantly better on trained versus untrained words in isolation, once the trained words were embedded in sentences, no improvement in recognition over untrained words within the same sentences was shown.CONCLUSIONS: Older hearing-impaired listeners were able to significantly improve their word-recognition abilities through training with one talker and to the same degree as young normal-hearing listeners. The improved performance was maintained across talkers and across time. This might imply that training a listener using a standardized list and talker may still provide benefit when these same words are presented by novel talkers outside the clinic. However, training on isolated words was not sufficient to transfer to fluent speech for the specific sentence materials used within this study. Further investigation is needed regarding approaches to improve a hearing aid user's speech understanding in everyday communication situations."
"16470470","An evaluation of digital cellular handsets by hearing aid users.","Audible interference from digital cellular telephones (cell phones) has been a long standing problem for hearing aid users. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has lifted the hearing aid compatibility exception on cell phones and imposed a set of requirements effective September 2005. We conducted an experiment to determine how well hearing aid wearers are able to use commercially available digital cell phones. Hearing aid users evaluated the usability of six digital cellular handsets. The results suggest that certain transmission technologies create more annoyance from interference than others and that the type of hearing aid-to-telephone coupling (microphone or telecoil) can influence a user's experience of interference. However, the results also suggest that interference alone does not fully predict the usability of a cell phone for hearing aid users. These findings have implications for the American National Standards Institute C63.19 test and measurement standard that is used to rate cell phones' compliance with the FCC ruling and the education of consumers with regard to their expectations for cell phone use."
"16470467","Clinical management of tinnitus using a &quot;progressive intervention&quot; approach.","Chronic tinnitus is experienced by 10%-15% of the population, of which only about 20% require clinical intervention. People requiring intervention have different levels of need, ranging from the provision of basic information to long-term, individualized treatment. We address this clinical need by outlining a five-level &quot;progressive intervention&quot; approach to the management of tinnitus that would provide a systematic framework for treatment by audiologists. At each level, patients must be appropriately referred-usually to otolaryngology, psychology, and/or psychiatry. Level 1 is an interview method of screening for determining if the person requires clinical intervention (and addressing basic questions). Level 2 is the provision of structured group educational counseling. If the screening determines that care is urgently required or if further help is needed following the group session(s), a tinnitus intake assessment (Level 3) should be performed. The intake assessment, which includes educational counseling, can often meet a patient's needs. If not, then a program of continuing treatment (Level 4) would be indicated. If significant benefit were not achieved through consistent treatment over 1-2 years, longer-term treatment (Level 5) would be indicated, which could include alternate or multiple treatment modalities. At all levels, the goal is to minimize the impact of tinnitus on the patient's life as efficiently as possible."
"16454285","Subjective assessment of listening environments in university classrooms: perceptions of students.","A questionnaire is developed to evaluate perception of the listening environment by university students. The objectives were to develop a questionnaire-based measurement tool, derive a measure of perceived classroom-listening quality, use the questionnaire to investigate factors that enhance, impair, or do not affect perceived listening quality, and consider the implications for classroom design. The questionnaire was administered to over 5700 students in 30 classrooms at one university. Physical and acoustical measurements were also performed in each classroom. The questionnaire included items that recorded aspects of student perception, as well as individual, course-, and instructor-specific factors. Responses to 19 perception items generated a perception of listening ease (PLE) score for each student and a classroom-average score. Decreased PLE was associated with women, English-second-larguage students, those with hearing impairment, students not interested in the course material, and those who found the material difficult. Increased PLE was associated with higher speech transmission index, acceptable lighting, temperature and seating, better instructor voice, increased visual-aid use, and easier course material. Results indicate that PLE is a useful measure of student perception of the classroom-listening environment, and that optimal classroom acoustical design must take into consideration &quot;in-use&quot; conditions, as well as classroom physical characteristics."
"16438124","The experience of African American women living with HIV: creating a prevention film for teens.","The personal and social costs of HIV are well documented. What remains unknown is the effect of public disclosure of HIV status on the individual who is doing the disclosing. This study describes the experience of four African American women living with HIV who participated in the development of an intergenerational education intervention for African American adolescent girls. These women suggested that they be filmed discussing the &quot;dark side&quot; of HIV in an effort to create an intergenerational education intervention that would alter the risk-taking behavior that they observed in young women in their community. After a rough cut of the film was completed, these women viewed the film and participated in a focus group during which they discussed what it was like to reveal and revisit their own painful experiences associated with becoming infected and then living with HIV. Findings from content analysis of transcribed dialogue included the following positive themes: (a) self-acceptance by telling one's own story and hearing the stories of the other women, (b) a sense of liberation by disclosing publicly one's image and message and letting go of others' judgments, (c) feeling supported by meeting other women who share the same experience, (d) value of using the film to impact or save young people from the pain one has experienced. A negative theme emerged related to personal pain in reliving the individual's history with HIV."

This article describes a prevention program and its effects on the incidence of falls in geriatric hospital wards. It was a prospective cohort study with historical control including all 4,272 patients (mean age 80, 69% female) before and 2,982 (mean age 81, 69% female) after introduction of the intervention. The intervention included fall-risk assessment on admission and reassessment after a fall; risk alert; additional supervision and assistance with the patients' transfer and use of the toilet; provision of an information leaflet; individual patient and caregiver counseling; encouragement of appropriate use of eyeglasses, hearing aids, footwear, and mobility devices; and staff education. Measurements included standardized fall-incidence reporting, activity of daily living and mobility status, number of falls and injurious falls, and number of patients who fell. Before the intervention was introduced, 893 falls were recorded. After the intervention was implemented, only 468 falls were recorded (incidence rate ratio (IRR)=0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.73-0.92), 240 versus 129 total injurious falls (IRR=0.84, 95% CI=0.67-1.04), 10 versus nine falls with fracture (IRR=1.40, 95% CI=0.51-3.85) and 611 versus 330 fallers. The relative risk of falling was significantly reduced (0.77, 95% CI=0.68-0.88). A structured multifactorial intervention reduced the incidence of falls, but not injurious falls, in a hospital ward setting with existing geriatric multidisciplinary care. Improvement of functional competence and mobility may be relevant to fall prevention in older hospital inpatients."
"19263563","Low vision, ADL and hearing assistive device use among older persons with visual impairments.","Assistive devices (AD) have long played an important role in occupational therapy practice as a way of enabling activities of daily living (ADL), but no studies to date have investigated the use of low vision AD among older persons with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) as well as devices for ADL performance and hearing. The purpose of this study was to describe AD users and to investigate the association of AD and ADL. A health promotion program versus an individual program was investigated within a randomised design. The study was based on data from 131 participants, 28-months after intervention. Data on prescribed ADs were examined through medical records and registers. The participants in the health promotion program used low vision AD in combination with ADL devices to a higher degree, whereas participants in the individual program used just optical AD. Greater use of non-optical AD within the individual program and greater use of ADL devices within the health promotion program was weakly associated with higher level of ADL dependence. There was no significant association between the number of low vision AD and having a decreased, a maintained or improved level of dependence at 28 months."

Cardiac auscultation is non-invasive, inexpensive and fast. It is also highly unreliable, and requires good hearing and considerable expertise. In this paper, we describe an audio-visual tool designed to help people learn to be better at cardiac auscultation. The use of digital signal processing techniques makes pathological findings more recognizable in both audio and visual representations. This reduces dependence on the ability of people to hear relevant information."
"17943685","Effectiveness of group versus individual hearing aid visits.","Demand for hearing aid services in the Veterans Health Administration increased over 300% from 1996 to 2005, challenging the delivery of timely, high-quality care. Using group visits may help meet these needs, but whether this approach would still provide high-quality rehabilitation is unclear. This study determined whether group visits worsen hearing aid outcomes. It included a retrospective observational cohort in veterans seeking hearing aids at the Department of Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System from September 2004 to March 2005, when the clinic was using both individual and group visits. Medical records were reviewed for all new hearing aid patients seen during this period. Hearing-related outcome questionnaires were compared between patients seen for individual versus group fitting and/or follow-up visits. Results revealed that hearing thresholds were similar between patients seen individually and in groups. Of 74 patients who returned self-administered questionnaires after the follow-up, those who received both fitting and follow-up in a group format reported similar hearing handicap and better hearing-related function, satisfaction, and adherence than patients who received individual visits. Group visits did not appear to yield worse outcomes in this nonrandomized retrospective chart review. Definitive statements must await randomized comparisons."
"17823545","Controversies in aural atresia repair.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss recent controversies regarding the management of aural atresia.RECENT FINDINGS: Management of unilateral atresia is less controversial. Candidacy for successful repair is based on high-resolution computed tomography findings and atresia grading. The bone-anchored hearing aid is a viable alternative strategy for hearing improvement. Stability of hearing results following atresia repair improves with the number of atresiaplasties performed. Development of image-guided surgery may provide benefit in atresia surgery. New unrecognized rare complications of aural atresia and atresia repair including salivary fistula and middle ear cholesteatoma are now being recognized and are manageable.SUMMARY: Management of aural atresia continues to be difficult and surrounded by controversy. New studies and cases series may shed light on these management issues."

Otoscopy, tuning fork testing and measurement of hearing distance provide importance information for the differentiation of hardness of hearing. In the case of noise deafness, the general physician has a preventive task. With regard to the provision of a hearing aid he can play a supportive role as a mediator between the hearing aid wearer, the ENT specialist and the acoustician."
"17521102","Knowledge and attitude of infantry soldiers to hearing conservation.","OBJECTIVE: This study examined British infantry soldiers' knowledge of hearing conservation and explored the various factors that influenced their behavior.METHOD: This followed qualitative methodology. Data were collected through focus group discussion and semistructured interviews. Twenty-three soldiers from a typical infantry unit were involved in this study. Data analysis involved both question and content analysis. Validity of the research instrument and reliability were ensured.RESULTS: All of the soldiers felt their hearing could be affected by their job. Even though many were not aware of the presence of a hearing conservation policy, they knew about specific aspects of the policy. A number of factors prevented the proper use of the personal hearing protection devices even though they were aware of their effectiveness in the reduction of noise hazard. These included communication difficulties, discomfort, and the impracticability of using them in certain circumstances. There was also a suggestion of a preponderance of noise-induced hearing loss on the left, which is the side often left unprotected to aid communication. Suggestions were put forward on ways of improving the hearing conservation program.CONCLUSION: An effective Army hearing conservation program should be comprehensive. It should incorporate appropriate knowledge, sociological issues, and economic considerations such as choice making and opportunity cost. There should be a well-structured hearing education program with targeted and appropriate behavioral modification. It should be compulsory and include lectures and videos given at least once a year. Improvements are required to increase the proper use of personal hearing protection devices and thus reduce the morbidity associated with noise-induced hearing loss."
"17496672","A randomized controlled trial evaluating the active communication education program for older people with hearing impairment.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the Active Communication Education (ACE) program for older people with hearing impairment and to investigate factors that influence response to the program. The ACE is a group program that runs for 2 hr per week for 5 wk.DESIGN: In this double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial, 178 older people with, on average, mild to moderate hearing impairment were randomly allocated to one of two groups. Approximately half had been fitted with hearing aid/s in the past. One group (N = 78) undertook a placebo social program for the first 5 wk, followed by the ACE program. They were assessed before the social program, immediately after it, and then again immediately post-ACE. The other group (N = 100) undertook the ACE program only and were assessed before and after ACE. In addition, 167 participants were reassessed 6 mo after completing ACE. Assessments were all self-report and included two sets of measures: 1) those administered both before and after the program-the Hearing Handicap Questionnaire, the Quantified Denver Scale of Communicative Function, the Self-Assessment of Communication, the Ryff Psychological Well-Being Scale, the Short-Form 36 health-related quality of life measure; and 2) those administered postprogram only-the Client Oriented Scale of Improvement, the International Outcome Inventory-Alternative Interventions, and a qualitative questionnaire. All assessments were conducted by a researcher blinded to participants' group membership. The relationships between participant response to the ACE program and a number of client-related factors were also investigated. These factors were the participants' age, gender, hearing loss, hearing aid use, attitudes to hearing impairment (as measured using the Hearing Attitudes to Rehabilitation Questionnaire) and the involvement of significant others.RESULTS: For those participants who completed the social program initially, significant improvements were found on the Quantified Denver Scale of Communicative Function and on the Mental Component Score of the Short-Form 36 only, when pre- and postprogram scores were compared. For those who completed the ACE program, there were significant pre-to-post improvements on the Hearing Handicap Questionnaire, the Quantified Denver Scale of Communicative Function, the Self-Assessment of Communication, and the Ryff Psychological Well-Being Scale. These improvements after ACE were maintained at 6 mo. Higher scores on the Hearing Attitudes to Rehabilitation Questionnaire before the ACE program were associated with greater positive change on a number of the pre-post program measures. Using the Client Oriented Scale of Improvement, 75% of participants reported some improvement on the primary goal they wished to achieve with the ACE. Positive outcomes were also recorded with the International Outcome Inventory-Alternative Interventions.CONCLUSIONS: This research study provides evidence for the effectiveness of the ACE program and indicates that such communication programs have an important place in the audiological rehabilitation of older adults. They should be considered as an alternative or a supplement to traditional interventions such as hearing aid fitting."
"17494874","Evidence for the use of hearing assistive technology by adults: the role of the FM system.","Hearing assistive technologies include listening, alerting, and/or signaling devices that use auditory, visual, and/or tactile modalities to augment communication and/or facilitate awareness of environmental sounds. The importance of hearing assistive technologies in the management of adults with hearing loss was recently acknowledged in an evidence-based clinical practice guideline developed by the American Academy of Audiology. Most currently available evidence for hearing assistive technology use by adults focuses on frequency-modulated (FM) technology. Previous research is reviewed that demonstrates the efficacy of FM devices for adults in terms of laboratory measures of speech understanding in noise. Also reviewed are the outcomes from field trials of FM use by community-dwelling adults, which, to date, have been disappointing. Few to no individuals, in previous studies, elected to use FM devices at the end of the trial periods. Data are presented from a 1-group pretest-posttest study examining the role of extensive counseling, coaching, and instruction on FM use by adults. In addition, the potential influence of the cost of devices to the individual was eliminated by conducting the study with veterans who were eligible to receive FM systems through the Veterans Affairs National Hearing Aid Program. Positive outcomes were obtained at the end of a 6-week trial period and were found to remain 1 year after study completion. Implications for increasing the evidence base for the use of FM devices by adults are discussed."

However few comparable studies are available from countries in the Developing World. The present study was undertaken in Nigeria where there is an estimated adult HIV prevalence rate of 5.4%. We sought to compare HIV knowledge among deaf and hearing individuals in order to identify how effectively deaf members of the community are being reached by HIV/AIDS messages.METHODS: A survey comparing knowledge about HIV/AIDS among deaf and hard of hearing adolescents (n = 50) and young adults (n = 50) was undertaken.RESULTS: Significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) in levels of understanding about certain aspects of how AIDS is spread were identified as well as differences in available resources for access to accurate information among deaf members of the population.CONCLUSION: These findings from Nigeria speak strongly to the need for the development of interventions that include people with disabilities in public health and HIV/AIDS strategies and that address their specific vulnerabilities. Evaluating the adaptation of education material and the inclusion of the deaf population in HIV awareness programmes is an urgent 'next step.'"

"17225638","Is there a link between hearing aid use, employment, and income?","This paper examines hearing aid use by 60 congenitally deaf individuals who attended special education units in South Australia. The study indicates that only one-third to half of deaf adults wore their hearing aids in social situations for speech detection. Just over one-third (n = 22) of the deaf adults involved in this study wore their hearing aids at work and less than half (n = 27) wore their hearing aids at home. Younger deaf adults were more likely to wear their hearing aids in the home than older deaf adults. Younger deaf adults tended to wear their hearing aids more frequently when they were at school if they had perceived their teachers had a positive attitude to deafness. This study found that there was no statistically significant relationship between wearing hearing aids and employment status. There was also no statistically significant difference in hearing aid use between men and women. The low use of hearing aids could be attributed at least in part to the current Australian policy regarding supply and servicing of hearing aids to congenitally deaf individuals which ceases to be free after the individual reaches 21 years of age."

Furthermore, about 1 in 5 Canadian seniors has difficulty hearing, seeing, or communicating. The primary goal of the study was to investigate the relationship between hearing impairment and the use of information and communication technologies by older adults. A questionnaire about use of technologies was administered to 135 older adults and hearing was measured using audiometry. Hearing was found to be related to the extent of use of communication technologies, especially newer and more specialized technologies. Those with hearing loss who did not use a hearing aid did not use other technologies as much as peers with good hearing or hearing-aid users. Overall, the extent of and ability to use information and communication technologies was greater for the study sample than in previous findings for a national sample; however, the patterns of usage of various technologies and the factors influencing use were similar in the two samples. Recommendations are made for future research, health education programs, and universal design."
"18707628","Clinical practice guideline: cerumen impaction.","OBJECTIVE: This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing cerumen impaction, defined as an accumulation of cerumen that causes symptoms, prevents assessment of the ear, or both. We recognize that the term &quot;impaction&quot; suggests that the ear canal is completely obstructed with cerumen and that our definition of cerumen impaction does not require a complete obstruction. However, cerumen impaction is the preferred term since it is consistently used in clinical practice and in the published literature to describe symptomatic cerumen or cerumen that prevents assessment of the ear. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with cerumen impaction.PURPOSE: The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve diagnostic accuracy for cerumen impaction, promote appropriate intervention in patients with cerumen impaction, highlight the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, promote appropriate therapeutic options with outcomes assessment, and improve counseling and education for prevention of cerumen impaction. In creating this guideline the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of audiology, family medicine, geriatrics, internal medicine, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, and pediatrics.RESULTS: The panel made a strong recommendation that 1) clinicians should treat cerumen impaction that causes symptoms expressed by the patient or prevents clinical examination when warranted. The panel made recommendations that 1) clinicians should diagnose cerumen impaction when an accumulation of cerumen is associated with symptoms, or prevents needed assessment of the ear (the external auditory canal or tympanic membrane), or both; 2) clinicians should assess the patient with cerumen impaction by history and/or physical examination for factors that modify management, such as one or more of the following: nonintact tympanic membrane, ear canal stenosis, exostoses, diabetes mellitus, immunocompromised state, or anticoagulant therapy; 3) the clinician should examine patients with hearing aids for the presence of cerumen impaction during a healthcare encounter (examination more frequently than every three months, however, is not deemed necessary); 4) clinicians should treat the patient with cerumen impaction with an appropriate intervention, which may include one or more of the following: cerumenolytic agents, irrigation, or manual removal other than irrigation; and 5) clinicians should assess patients at the conclusion of in-office treatment of cerumen impaction and document the resolution of impaction. If the impaction is not resolved, the clinician should prescribe additional treatment. If full or partial symptoms persist despite resolution of impaction, alternative diagnoses should be considered. The panel offered as an option that 1) clinicians may observe patients with nonimpacted cerumen that is asymptomatic and does not prevent the clinician from adequately assessing the patient when an evaluation is needed; 2) clinicians may distinguish and promptly evaluate the need for intervention in the patient who may not be able to express symptoms but presents with cerumen obstructing the ear canal; 3) the clinician may treat the patient with cerumen impaction with cerumenolytic agents, irrigation, or manual removal other than irrigation; and 4) clinicians may educate/counsel patients with cerumen impaction/excessive cerumen regarding control measures.DISCLAIMER: This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in managing cerumen impaction. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem."

"18628281","The role of audiologic evaluation in progressive audiologic tinnitus management.","Progressive Audiologic Tinnitus Management (PATM) is based on the premise that tinnitus is managed most efficiently using a hierarchy of clinical services that address different levels of need. PATM includes five levels of management: (a) triage; (b) audiologic evaluation; (c) group education; (d) tinnitus evaluation; and (e) individualized management. This article provides an overview of PATM and focuses on the procedures that make up the Level 2 Audiologic Evaluation. The evaluation is conducted to assess the potential need for medical, audiologic (hearing loss, tinnitus, hyperacusis), and/or mental health services. The Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, Hearing Handicap Inventory, and Tinnitus and Hearing Survey are used to differentiate effects of tinnitus and hearing loss. If indicated, patients are interviewed with the Tinnitus-Impact Screening Interview. Patients requiring amplification receive hearing aids. Often, management of hearing loss at Level 2 addresses any problems that were attributed to the tinnitus, which obviates further tinnitus-specific intervention."

The demographics of deaf VCT clients were compared with hearing clients at the same sites as well as where clients had learned of the service, HIV risks, and HIV test results. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used.RESULTS: During the two year period (January 2004 to December 2005) 1709 Deaf and 1649 hearing clients were seen at three Deaf VCT sites. The majority of Deaf clients in this sample learned of the services through the peer education programme. Data indicate that Deaf VCT clients are as much at risk of HIV from sexual transmission as their hearing counterparts and that Deaf persons seeking VCT services have an HIV prevalence of 7%, similar to the national rate of 6.7%.CONCLUSIONS: The Deaf in Kenya are at risk of HIV and there is an urgent need for Deaf-friendly HIV services, supplemented by peer education programmes. This is the first published report describing HIV services run by the Deaf for the Deaf in the developing world."
"18588408","Health literacy not race predicts end-of-life care preferences.","BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported that African Americans are more likely than whites to prefer aggressive treatments at the end of life.OBJECTIVE: Since the medical information presented to subjects is frequently complex, we hypothesized that apparent differences in end-of-life preferences and decision making may be due to disparities in health literacy. A video of a patient with advanced dementia may overcome communication barriers associated with low health literacy.DESIGN: Before and after oral survey.PARTICIPANTS: Subjects presenting to their primary care doctors.METHODS: Subjects were asked their preferences for end-of-life care after they heard a verbal description of advanced dementia. Subjects then viewed a 2-minute video of a patient with advanced dementia and were asked again about their preferences. For the analysis, preferences were dichotomized into comfort care and aggressive care. Health literacy was measured using the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) and subjects were divided into three literacy categories: low (0-45, sixth grade and below), marginal (46-60, seventh to eighth grade) and adequate (61-66, ninth grade and above). Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were fit using stepwise algorithms to examine factors related to initial preferences before the video.RESULTS: A total of 80 African Americans and 64 whites completed the interview. In unadjusted analyses, African Americans were more likely than whites to have preferences for aggressive care after the verbal description, odds ratio (OR) 4.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1-10.9). Subjects with low or marginal health literacy were also more likely than subjects with adequate health literacy to have preferences for aggressive care after the verbal description, OR 17.3 (95% CI 6.0-49.9) and OR 11.3 (95% CI 4.2-30.8) respectively. In adjusted analyses, health literacy (low health literacy: OR 7.1, 95% CI 2.1-24.2; marginal health literacy OR 5.1, 95% CI 1.6-16.3) but not race (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.3-3.2) was an independent predictor of preferences after the verbal description. After watching a video of advanced dementia, there were no significant differences in the distribution of preferences by race or health literacy.CONCLUSIONS: Health literacy and not race was an independent predictor of end-of-life preferences after hearing a verbal description of advanced dementia. In addition, after viewing a video of a patient with advanced dementia there were no longer any differences in the distribution of preferences according to race and health literacy. These findings suggest that clinical practice and research relating to end-of-life preferences may need to focus on a patient education model incorporating the use of decision aids such as video to ensure informed decision-making."
"18540375","[Analyses of factors contributing to hearing aids use and both subjective and objective estimates of hearing].","The use of hearing aids, regardless actual implementation, may be interpreted as a cry for help in hearing difficulty. We assessed factors contributing to hearing aid possession and predicted needs of hearing assistance from the distribution of hearing level in self-estimated (subjective) hearing loss and hearing loss pointed out by others (objective) in a population-based aging cohort. Of 1192 men and 1163 women aged 40 to 84 years, the prevalence of hearing loss using the criteria of a mean hearing threshold&gt;25dB at frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz in the better ear was 23.6%. Hearing aids were possessed by 11.0% in the hearing loss group. Statistical analysis by gender was done to identify factors associated with hearing aid possession using stepwise multiple regression in which independent variables were age, hearing in the better and worse ear, and items from response to a questionnaire on self-estimated hearing loss, hearing loss pointed out by others, job, household income, financial satisfaction, education, housemate, how often others were talked to and how often those surveyed went out. Age, better-ear hearing, worse-ear hearing, and education statistically influenced hearing aid possession in men, and age, better-ear hearing, and hearing loss pointed out by others statistically influenced women. Age had a negative effect on hearing aid possession in both men and women, indicating that possession decreased with aging. Scattergrams were plotted with worse-ear hearing on the y axis and better-ear hearing on the x axis for 4 groups of respondents divided into groups with self-estimated hearing loss or hearing loss pointed out by others: (1) no subjective and objective hearing loss, (2) subjective but no objective hearing loss, (3) objective but no subjective hearing loss, and (4) both subjective and objective hearing loss. Many respondents had either subjective or objective or both subjective and objective hearing loss, even within 20 dB of hearing level of both ears in their 40s. These facts implied that early-stage candidates for hearing aids may not require threshold reduction, although aided thresholds were commonly used indicators in fitting."

"18506049","Effects of long-term training on aided speech-recognition performance in noise in older adults.","PURPOSE: This study examined how repeated presentations of words in noise affected understanding of both trained and untrained words in noise (in isolation and in sentences).METHOD: Eight older listeners with hearing impairment completed a word-based auditory training protocol lasting approximately 12 weeks. Training materials were presented in a closed-set condition with both orthographic and auditory feedback on a trial-to-trial basis. Performance on both trained and untrained lexically easy and hard words, as well as generalization to sentences, was measured. Listeners then returned for an additional 14 weeks to monitor retention of the trained materials.RESULTS: Training listeners on 1 set of words improved both their open- and closed-set recognition of the trained materials but did not improve performance on another set of untrained words. When training switched to the other set, performance for the new set of words improved significantly, whereas significant improvements on the previously trained words were maintained. Training generalized to unfamiliar talkers but did not generalize to untrained words or untrained keywords within running speech. Listeners were able to maintain improved performance over an extended period.CONCLUSION: Older listeners were able to improve their word-recognition performance in noise on a set of 150 words with training."

"18299494","House staff member awareness of older inpatients' risks for hazards of hospitalization.","BACKGROUND: Many hospitalized older adults develop iatrogenic complications unrelated to their presenting diagnoses that can result in longer hospitalizations, functional impairment, or unanticipated medical or surgical interventions. These complications are often referred to as &quot;hazards of hospitalization&quot; and include delirium, malnutrition, urinary incontinence, pressure ulcers, depression, falls, restraint use, infection, functional decline, adverse drug effects, and death. The aims of this study were to assess house staff member awareness of older patients' risk factors for developing hazards of hospitalization and to determine areas in which interventions may help improve recognition.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed, from December 1, 1999, through August 31, 2002, of internal medicine and medicine or pediatric house staff members and their patients from 4 medical units at Mount Sinai Medical Center. Each house staff member completed a 23-item survey on 3 of their recently admitted patients. These patients and, if appropriate, their surrogates were interviewed by the study investigator within 2 hours of the completion of the house staff survey. House staff member responses are compared with those obtained by the study investigator. The completed house staff surveys were compared with the reference standard, and areas of agreement and disagreement were noted.RESULTS: Eighty-six house staff teams, consisting of 1 intern and 1 resident (in either the second or third postgraduate year), and 105 patients were enrolled in the study. The house staff members were in frank disagreement or poor agreement with the reference standard in knowing the following: how well their patients were oriented to place or how long they had been hospitalized; patients' quality of sleep, presence of pain, history of falls, mood, quantity of food intake, and use of hearing aids, glasses, or an ambulation assistive device when at home; and the name of their patients' primary care physicians.CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that internal medicine house staff members are not aware of many of their patients' risk factors for developing the hazards of hospitalization. Some of these deficits are glaring, particularly the lack of awareness of patients' orientation to place and time (duration of hospitalization), presence of pain, and the identity of their primary care physician. It will likely take education and cultural change to improve this performance. Such improvement could be accomplished as part of 3 of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education competencies: interpersonal communication, patient care, and systems-based practice. Such a process might improve not only house staff member awareness but also patient outcomes, since interdisciplinary communication and interventions are key to preventing the hazards of hospitalization."

Program consisted of three meetings every fifteen days, where information and education on the proper use hearing aids was transmitted.RESULTS: Most of the patients participated actively in the meetings spontaneously giving their opinion or answering questions when so requested. All elderly had been informed as to the importance of accepting their auditory deficiency and on the need to be motivated towards using hearing aids. Moreover, listening to depositions of other elderly users seemed to facilitate understanding of their own difficulties and stimulated them in the process of getting used to the sound amplification.CONCLUSION: Groups structure facilitated interaction among aged ones, helping them to clarify communication doubts and strategies and, consequently, it promoted their adaptation."

Despite the remarkable expansion in newborn hearing screening since 2000, its feasibility and the benefits of early identification and intervention, many major challenges still remain. In this article, the Committee for the Early Detection of Hearing Loss (Comisión para la Detección Precoz de la Hipoacusia, CODEPEH) updates the recommendations that are considered important for the future development of early hearing detection and intervention (EDHI) systems in the following points: 1. Screening protocols: Separate protocols are recommended for NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Units) and well-infant nurseries. 2. Diagnostic audiology evaluation. Professionals with skills and expertise in evaluating newborn and young infants should provide diagnosis, selection and fitting of amplification devices. 3. Medical evaluation. Risk factors for congenital and acquired hearing loss have been combined in a single list rather than grouped by time of onset. A stepwise diagnostic paradigm is diagnostically more efficient and cost-effective than a simultaneous testing approach. 4. Early intervention and surveillance. All individuals providing services to infants with hearing loss should have specialized training and expertise in the development of audition, speech and language. Regular surveillance should be performed on developmental milestones, auditory skills, parental concerns, and middle ear status. 5. Quality control. Data management as part of an integrated system is important to monitor and improve the quality of EDHI services."
"19936660","Neonatal cytomegalovirus infection: diagnostic modalities available for early disease detection.","CMV is a ubiquitous virus. In India, there is high seroendemicity with almost 99% adults showing IgG antibodies. Infection or re-activation becomes important in immunocompromised host (Transplant recipients, Cancer therapy patients and patients with HIV/AIDS). Neonates form a distinctive high risk population for congenital CMV infection and suffer disastrous sequlae of the same. Neonatal infections may be congenital in nature or may be acquired after birth during first month of life via infected breast milk or due to exposure to high risk blood products. The risk for transmission of the virus to the fetus is higher in primary infected mothers than in mothers with reactivated disease. Primary CMV infections are reported in 1-4% of seronegative women during pregnancy and the risk for viral transmission to fetus is 30-40%. Reactivation of a CMV infection during pregnancy is reported in 10-30% of seropositive women and the risk of transmitting the virus is about 1-3%. The adverse outcome of congenital neonatal CMV infection includes-microcephaly (70%), intellectual impairment (60%), sensineural hearing loss (35%), choriorenitis (22%), hepatosplenomegaly (70%), jaundice (68%), thrombocytopenia (65%), low birth weight (65%), pneumonitis (2-5%) and congenital heart disease (&lt;5%). About 5-10% of congenitally infected asymptomatic infants will have neurological problems later in life the most common of which is unilateral or bilateral sensory neural hearing loss. All immunocompromised hosts, including pre-term neonates, mount weak antibody responses (IgM), making serological detection of CMV infection in them, fallacious. Thus, it is imperative to use antigen detection methods such as quantitative PCR or PP65 Antigenaemia assays to detect CMV infection in immunocompromised host. Sakhuja et al and Minz et al have demonstrated that PP65 Antigenaemia assay is very good for diagnosing CMV disease in renal transplant recipients. The present review tends to highlight the role of newer diagnostic modalities in early CMV infection detection in neonatal population."
"19873963","Therapeutic home adaptations for older adults with disabilities.","Family physicians commonly care for older patients with disabilities. Many of these patients need help maintaining a therapeutic home environment to preserve their comfort and independence. Patients often have little time to decide how to address the limitations of newly-acquired disabilities. Physicians can provide patients with general recommendations in home modification after careful history and assessment. Universal design features, such as one-story living, no-step entries, and wide hallways and doors, are key adaptations for patients with physical disabilities. Home adaptations for patients with dementia include general safety measures such as grab bars and door alarms, and securing potentially hazardous items, such as cleaning supplies and medications. Improved lighting and color contrast, enlarged print materials, and vision aids can assist patients with limited vision. Patients with hearing impairments may benefit from interventions that provide supplemental visual and vibratory cues and alarms. Although funding sources are available, home modification is often a nonreimbursed expense. However, sufficient home modifications may allow the patient and caregivers to safely remain in the home without transitioning to a long-term care facility."

Lack of access to health information conveyed via radio, television, or ambient auditory sources such as public conversation further aggravates this population's low health literacy. Methods of adapting health education material for hearing LEP populations do not reach deaf audiences with equal effectiveness.METHOD: We adapt health education material for deaf audiences by first determining the &quot;learning points&quot; contained in vetted source material. A dialog-based film script covering those learning points is created. Supplemental content addressing common deaf population knowledge gaps and sociocultural experiences is added. Deaf actors are filmed following the adapted American Sign Language (ASL) script. Their ASL is back-translated into English to yield vocal track and subtitle scripts.

However, a distinction is not often made between corrected and uncorrected HI in the literature.OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of corrected and uncorrected HI, and assess whether there are differences in sociodemographic factors among older adults (age 50+) with corrected HI, uncorrected HI and no HI.METHOD: Secondary data came from two national data sources: the 1994 National Population Health Survey (n = 6,202) and the Canadian Community Health Survey 1.1 (n = 50,113). We use multinomial logistic regression to assess sociodemographic risk markers for both corrected and uncorrected HI.RESULTS: Both corrected and uncorrected HI was common in this age group: 6.5 and 4.0%, respectively, in the National Population Health Survey and 5.7 and 2.5% in the Canadian Community Health Survey. In both samples, the prevalence of corrected and uncorrected HI increased with age and was more common among men. Respondents with either corrected or uncorrected HI were less likely to be married and more likely to report other physical health problems compared to respondents with no HI. In the Canadian Community Health Survey, income was associated with lower odds of reporting uncorrected HI, while education was associated with reduced likelihood of reporting corrected HI.CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that HI is prevalent in later life, and sociodemographic factors such as marital status, education, and income do not differ significantly between those with corrected and uncorrected HI compared with respondents with no HI. Further investigation into the factors associated with hearing aid use is necessary to better target older adults who might benefit from wearing a hearing aid."

"20597405","[Hearing aids rehabilitation: state of the art].","OBJECTIVES: The three-dimensional characteristic of heari ng as a neurosensory loss can be associated with distortions in the axes of intensity, frequency and also temporal. This type of distortions can be isolated or combined, with many functional characteristics which complicate the fixing of the hearing aid and makes its result extremely variable. The ENT specialist in charge of the prescription of the hearing aid must know the various types of available devices, its indications and limitations. The different current hearing aids by acoustic stimulation are described, behind the ear, intra-auricular, intra-canal, micro-behind the ear with receiver in the canal (RIC). Some clinical and audiometric elements make it possible to envisage the difficulty of such equipment as the air bone gap, the dynamic, the frequential shift, the hearing discrimination. Concerning the hearing aid itself, the amplifier represents the fundamental part allowing the compensation of the quatitative loss; it presents however many possibilities of adaptation (multifrequential compression, the adaptive directionnality coming from the directional microphones, the suppression of the acoustic feedback, the increase of the bandwidth and software of statistical analysis of environmental acoustics as well as procedures of decision). Finally software of treatment of the signal like the software of suppression of acoustic feedback, identification of the speech and noise, of adaptive directionality, of measurement of the hearing thresholds (which is possible on certain prosthesis for each channel) refine the adjustment of the hearing aid.CONCLUSION: The knowledge of these technological possibilities currently available, like their indications and limitations, allows the ENT specialist to get an active role in the process of acceptation of the hearing aid."

"20339694","Psychometric properties of the international outcome inventory for hearing AIDS.","It is paramount to assess the psychometric properties of self-assessment tools in order to check the tests' reliability and validity, also to enable proper outcome interpretation.</AbstractText>: It is paramount to assess the psychometric properties of self-assessment tools in order to check the tests' reliability and validity, also to enable proper outcome interpretation.AIM: to check the psychometric properties of the IOI-HA (International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids) in its Portuguese version, called QI-AASI (International Questionnaire - Individual Sound Amplification Device), in terms of internal uniformity, correlation between the items and reproducibility.STUDY DESIGN: descriptive, observational and cross-sectional.MATERIALS AND METHODS: the questionnaire was deployed to 53 hearing aid users, 34 females and 19 males, with ages between 19 and 92 years - from incomplete basic education to complete higher education, encompassing subjects with monoaural and binaural sound amplification.RESULTS: the QI-AASI had a Cronbach Alpha of 0.69. In the correlation among the items, there were numerous significant correlations. The instrument was properly reproducible, except for item # 6, which presented a significant difference in comparing test and the retest.CONCLUSIONS: the QI-AASI is suggested in the rehabilitation process of users of hearing aides; nonetheless, the questionnaire can be difficult for subjects with low social and economic status when self-employed."
"20151879","The impact of health literacy on patient understanding of counseling and education materials.","Low health literacy is reported to have negative consequences on patient understanding of health-related information; however, there is a dearth of research regarding health literacy in an audiology-specific context. This study examines the grade level of language used in verbal and written communication samples during routine hearing aid orientation appointments. Patient counseling sessions were videotaped and transcribed; hearing aid instruction guides used during counseling sessions were also transcribed. The Flesch-Kincaid grade level formula was used to determine the approximate United States grade level equivalent of the counseling sessions, hearing aid instruction guides, and to predict patient health literacy. The results indicate that patient predicted health literacy likely impacts understanding of both one-on-one counseling and hearing aid instruction guides."
"20066921","Technology skills assessment for deaf and hard of hearing students in secondary school.","To BE COMPETITIVE in the workplace, deaf and hard of hearing students must not only possess basic computer literacy but also know how to use and care for personal assistive and listening technology. An instrument was developed and pilot-tested on 45 middle school and high school deaf and hard of hearing students in 5 public school programs, 4 urban and 1 suburban, to assess these students' current technology skills and to prepare them for post-high school expectations. The researchers found that the students' computer skills depended on their access to technology, which was not always present in the schools. Many students also did not know basic care practices or troubleshooting techniques for their own personal hearing aids (if worn), or how to access or use personal assistive technology."
"22200734","Management of hearing aid assembly by urban-dwelling hearing-impaired adults in a developed country: implications for a self-fitting hearing aid.","A self-fitting hearing aid, designed to be assembled and programmed without audiological or computer support, could bring amplification to millions of people in developing countries, who remain unaided due to the lack of a local, professional, audiological infrastructure. The ability to assemble and insert a hearing aid is fundamental to the successful use of a self-fitting device. In this study, the management of such tasks was investigated. Eighty older, urban-dwelling, hearing-impaired adults in a developed country were asked to follow a set of written, illustrated instructions to assemble two slim-fit behind-the-ear hearing aids. Participants were allowed to access assistance with the task from an accompanying partner. A range of personal and audiometric variables was measured through the use of structured questionnaires and standardized tests of health literacy, cognitive function, and manual dexterity. The results showed that 99% of participants were able to complete the hearing aid assembly task, either on their own or with assistance. Health literacy, or the ability to read and understand health-related text, and gender most strongly influenced participants' ability to complete the assembly task independently and accurately. Higher levels of health literacy were associated with an increased likelihood of independent and successful task completion. Male participants were more likely to complete the task on their own, while female participants were more likely to assemble the device without errors. The results of this study will inform future work regarding development of educational material for the self-fitting hearing aid as well as candidacy for such a device."
"22155784","Factors in client-clinician interaction that influence hearing aid adoption.","The influence of client-clinician interactions has not been emphasized in hearing health care, despite the extensive evidence of the impact of the provider-patient interaction on health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to identify factors in the client-clinician interaction that may influence hearing aid adoption. Thirteen adults who had received a hearing aid recommendation within the previous 3 months and 10 audiologists participated in a study to generate, sort, and rate the importance of factors in client-clinician interaction that may influence the hearing aid purchase decision. A concept mapping approach was used to define meaningful clusters of factors. Quantitative analysis and qualitative interpretation of the statements resulted in eight concepts. The concepts in order of their importance are (a) Ensuring client comfort, (b) Understanding and meeting client needs, (c) Client-centered traits and actions, (d) Acknowledging client as an individual, (e) Imposing undue pressure and discomfort, (f) Conveying device information by clinician, (g) Supporting choices and shared decision making, and (h) Factors in client readiness. Two overarching themes of client-centered interaction and client empowerment were identified. Results highlight the influence of the client-clinician interaction in hearing aid adoption and suggest the possibility of improving hearing aid adoption by empowering clients through a client-centered interaction."
"22043652","Health care policies and resisting consumers in a prototypical welfare state.","PURPOSE: It has been argued by researchers from the Anglo-Saxon nations that the rationality of the market has increasingly infiltrated the medical field. This paper seeks to enquire via policy analysis to what extent these principles have affected the prototypical welfare state of Denmark in relation to Danish hearing health policies.APPROACH: The paper is based on qualitative methods comprising observations and interviews in two hearing clinics.FINDINGS: The paper shows that rather than a &quot;withdrawal&quot; of the state there has been a process of reform. The data suggest that a distinguishing mark of the consumer role on offer in Denmark is that, along with a free hearing aid, the Danish health consumer enjoys a range of rights and reciprocal responsibilities. The paper concludes that few of the hearing-impaired patients were able to embrace the consumer ethos, and those who chose not to wear their prescribed hearing aids experienced the added burden of moral reproach.VALUE: It makes little sense to analyse abstracted rationalities without proceeding to analyse how they actually function in practice. This paper demonstrates empirically how and to what degree governmentality is embedded in social practice in two public hearing clinics in Denmark."

"21936744","Medical practitioners' attitudes to hearing rehabilitation for older adults.","OBJECTIVE: Medical practitioners have the potential to play a significant role in older adults' help seeking behaviour in relation to hearing rehabilitation. The current study aimed to look at attitudinal factors that influence practitioners' decisions to discuss hearing difficulties with older patients and refer them for hearing rehabilitation.DESIGN: A questionnaire based on constructs from the Health Belief Model was used to examine factors that may influence practitioners' referral decisions.STUDY SAMPLE: One hundred and ten practitioners' attitudes to hearing rehabilitation were examined.RESULTS: The results indicated that practitioners have a high level of awareness about their older patients' susceptibility to hearing loss, and a good understanding of the severity of the associated impacts on older adults' lives. Although practitioners acknowledged the theoretical benefits of hearing rehabilitation, many appear less certain about the potential for actual benefit for their older adults. Barriers to referral include negative perceptions about how older patients prioritise hearing, and patients' ability to afford and adapt to the use of hearing aids.CONCLUSIONS: Additional research and education targeted at these area may be beneficial for medical practitioners to increase referral behaviour and improve discussions about hearing rehabilitation with their older patients."
"21918453","Word recognition within a linguistic context:  effects of age, hearing acuity, verbal ability, and cognitive function.","OBJECTIVE: Participants in traditional studies of the effects of context on spoken word recognition have been university undergraduates. When older adults have been included, they have typically been matched with these young adults for verbal ability or years of education. Although this may be a good strategy for eliminating confounding variables, it is not clear how results of these studies may extend to the general population of young and older adults. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of adult age, hearing acuity, verbal ability, and cognitive function on the use of linguistic context in spoken word recognition.DESIGN: Fifty-three adults, aged 19 to 89 yr, heard short sentences in which the final word was masked by multitalker babble. The level of babble was progressively reduced in 2 dB steps until the sentence-final word could be correctly identified. Published norms were used to construct sets of sentences in which the same word could be heard with three levels of predictability (low, medium, and high) based on the linguistic context. In a fourth condition (no context), the words were preceded by a neutral carrier phrase. Participants received tests of verbal ability, with an emphasis on vocabulary knowledge, a brief test battery to assess cognitive function, and an assessment of hearing acuity based on pure-tone thresholds. Participants' hearing acuity ranged from normal acuity to moderate hearing loss.RESULTS: Results showed that the signal to noise ratio necessary for correct word recognition varied inversely with the probability of that word occurring in the sentence context. Hearing loss had a significant effect on word recognition for words heard in a neutral context, but the effect of hearing acuity diminished progressively with increasing contextual probability of the target word. Hierarchical multiple regressions showed that hearing acuity accounted for a significant amount of the variance at the lowest three levels of contextual probability but not at the highest probability level tested. Cognitive function contributed significantly to the obtained variance in word recognition performance at all levels of contextual probability tested. Moreover, participant age accounted for a significant amount of variance even after hearing acuity and cognitive function were taken into account. Verbal ability in the range represented by the test participants did not contribute significantly to recognition performance in any of the context conditions.CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral hearing acuity accounted for only a part of the variance in word recognition accuracy, with significant variance also contributed by individual differences in cognitive function and participant age. Results showed the ability to use linguistic context to aid spoken word recognition is sufficiently robust that a relatively wide range in verbal ability among native English speakers had no effect on recognition performance."
"21916818","International outcome inventory for hearing aids (IOI-HA): results from the Chinese version.","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to present normative data on the Chinese version of the international outcome inventory for hearing aids (IOI-HA) and examine the effectiveness of the hearing aid service.DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. The IOI-HA was administered in a paper and pencil format.STUDY SAMPLE: The IOI-HA and self-designed questionnaire were mailed to 1502 experienced hearing-aid users who received their hearing aids from 14 hearing service centers in mainland China. In all, 1049 completed responses were included in the final analysis, and descriptive statistics were reported.RESULTS: The mean scores of each item of the IOI-HA ranged from 3.55 to 4.16. The IOI-HA scores showed a skewed distribution, with the maximum frequency for a score of 4 or 5. The total IOI-HA scores ranged from 9 to 35, and the mean total score was 26.3. The results compared favorably with the previous reports, and slightly higher than the published norms, indicating a high level of self-reported outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: The IOI-HA could be used as an effective tool to measure the general effectiveness of the hearing aid outcomes in China. The implementation of the IOI-HA is time-efficient, imposing little burden on the clinician and patient."
"21851288","Assistive technology use is associated with reduced capability poverty: a cross-sectional study in Bangladesh.","PURPOSE: About half of all people with disabilities in developing countries live in extreme poverty. Focusing on the ends rather than the economic means of human development, the capability approach offers an alternative view of poverty. The purpose of this study was to explore the relation between assistive technology use and capability poverty in a low-income country.METHOD: Self-reported data on food intake, health care, education, politics, self-determination, self-respect, family relationships and friendships were collected in Bangladesh through interviews of people with hearing impairments using and not using hearings aids, and people with ambulatory impairments using and not using manual wheelchairs (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>583). Differences in outcomes between users and non-users of assistive technology were analyzed using logistic regression.RESULTS: Assistive technology users were more likely than non-users to report enhanced capabilities, hearing aid users to a larger extent than wheelchair users. Synergistic effects between assistive technology use and education were found.CONCLUSION: The use of assistive technology is predictive of reduced capability poverty in Bangladesh. Lack of wheelchair accessibility and the nature of selected outcomes may explain the limited association in the ambulatory group. Enhancing the effects of the other, there is support for providing education in combination with hearing aids. [Box: see text]."
"21824746","Teaching individuals with profound multiple disabilities to access preferred stimuli with multiple microswitches.","We replicated and extended previous research on microswitch facilitated choice making by individuals with profound multiple disabilities. Following an assessment of stimulus preferences, we taught 6 adults with profound multiple disabilities to emit 2 different responses to activate highly preferred stimuli. All participants learnt to activate both microswitches. Five participants showed a higher overall level of responding when both switches activating preferred stimuli were available concurrently. After completion of microswitch training, a choice assessment was conducted in which participants had access to 2 microswitches concurrently, with 1 connected to the most highly preferred stimulus and the other to a least preferred stimulus. Choice making behavior was shown in 3 participants and provided support for the preference assessment results. The results of the 3 remaining participants showed that both the most highly preferred and the least preferred stimuli may serve as reinforcers for microswitch activation responses."
"21794949","Everyday hearing functioning in unilateral versus bilateral hearing aid users.","PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to assess hearing functioning in everyday listening situations of bilateral and unilateral hearing aid (HA) users.METHOD: 80 Arabic-speaking HA users: 46 bilateral and 34 unilateral HA users with various degrees of HL. Participants completed the Speech, Spatial, and Qualities (SSQ) self-report questionnaire.RESULTS: In general, bilateral users performed better than unilateral users on the speech and spatial scales. For participants with symmetrical unaided HL, the bilateral group significantly surpassed the unilateral group on all three scales. For participants with asymmetrical unaided HL, no significant intergroup differences emerged. Regarding degree of HL, the moderate HL group outperformed the severe, and profound HL groups. No differences emerged between the severe and profound groups. Finally, more severe HL correlated with poorer SSQ performance. Similarly, better speech discrimination scores correlated with better SSQ performance.CONCLUSION: Results support the need for subjective questionnaires when assessing HA benefits."
"21756843","Rehabilitative online education versus internet discussion group for hearing aid users: a randomized controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: By using the Internet in the audiological rehabilitation process, it might be possible in a cost-effective way to include additional rehabilitation components by informing and guiding hearing aid users about such topics as communication strategies, hearing tactics, and how to handle hearing aids.PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of an online education program for adult experienced hearing aid users including professional guidance by an audiologist and compare it with the effects of participation in an online discussion forum without any professional contact.RESEARCH DESIGN: A randomized controlled study with two groups of participants. Repeated measures at prestudy, immediate follow-up, and a 6 mo follow-up.STUDY SAMPLE: Fifty-nine experienced hearing aid users participated in the study, ranging in age from 24 to 84 yr (mean 63.5 yr).INTERVENTION: The intervention group (N = 29) underwent a five-week rehabilitative online education in which activities for each week included information, tasks, and assignments, and contact with a professional audiologist was included. The participants in the control group (N = 30) were referred to an online discussion forum without any audiologist contact.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A set of questionnaires administered online were used as outcome measures: (1) Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly, (2) International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids, (3) Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life, and (4) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.RESULTS: Significant improvements measured by the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly were found in both groups of participants, and the effects were maintained at the 6 mo follow-up. The results on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale showed that the participants in the intervention group showed reduced symptoms of depression immediately/6 mo after the intervention. At the 6 mo follow-up participants in the control group reported fewer symptoms of anxiety than they did before the intervention started.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that the Internet can be used to deliver education to experienced hearing aid users who report residual hearing problems such that their problems are reduced by the intervention. The study also suggests that online discussion forums could be used in rehabilitation. A combination of online professional supervised education and online informal discussions could be a promising rehabilitation tool."

"21680930","Determinants of hearing aid acquisition in older adults.","OBJECTIVES: We determined factors associated with hearing aid acquisition in older adults.METHODS: We conducted a population-based, prospective study that used information from 3 examinations performed on study participants as part of the Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study (1993-2005). We included participants (n = 718; mean age = 70.5 years) who exhibited hearing loss at baseline or the first follow-up and had no prior history of hearing aid use. We defined hearing loss as a pure tone threshold average (PTA) at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kilohertz in the better ear of greater than 25 decibels Hearing Level.RESULTS: The 10-year cumulative incidence of hearing aid acquisition was 35.7%. Associated factors included education (college graduate vs all others: hazard ratio [HR]<U+200A>= 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]<U+200A>= 1.5, 4.1), self-perception of hearing (poor vs good or better: HR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.3, 5.0), score on a perceived hearing handicap inventory (+1 difference: HR = 1.1; 95% CI = 1.0, 1.1), and PTA (+ 5 dB difference: HR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.2, 1.6).CONCLUSIONS: The low rate of hearing aid ownership among older adults is a problem that still needs to be addressed."

Because primary care physicians may be the entry point for patients seeking help for tinnitus, we urge them to acknowledge this symptom and its potential negative impact on the patient's health and quality of life. Physicians should actively listen to the patient and provide hope and encouragement, but also provide realistic expectations about the course of treatment. The patient must also understand that there may be no singular &quot;cure&quot; for tinnitus and that management may involve multidisciplinary assessment and treatment."

These data were gathered through semi-structured interviews administered in the athlete's native language. Deaf athletes reported that when given the opportunity to compete with hearing athletes, it enhanced their opportunity for competition. Participating in sports with hearing athletes played an important role in the integration of deaf athletes into mainstream society. If adaptations to communication can be made in these integrated settings, the ability of deaf athletes to participate in such settings will increase."
"21277640","Fear of falling (FF): Psychosocial and physical factors among institutionalized older Chinese men in Taiwan.","Fear of falling (FF) can have multiple adverse consequences in the elderly. Although there are various fall prevention programs, little is known of FF and its associated characteristics. This study examined FF-associated physical and psychosocial factors in older Chinese men living in a veterans home in southern Taiwan. Subjects with a recent episode of delirium, of bed-ridden or wheelchair-bound status, severe hearing impairment or impaired cognition were excluded. Overall, 371 residents (mean age 82.1 ± 5.11 years, all males) participated. The prevalence of FF was 25.3%. Univariate analysis revealed that subjects in the FF group were older age, having lower education level, poorer sitting and standing balance, poorer activities of daily living (ADL), more depressive symptoms, higher chances of using walking aids, neurologic diseases, and a history of fall within the past 6 months. Logistic regression showed that depressive symptoms (odds ratio = OR = 6.73, 95%CI: 3.03-14.93, p &lt; 0.001), activities of daily living (OR = 2.48, 95%CI: 1.08-5.71, p = 0.033), history of fall in the past 6 months (OR = 2.47, 95%CI: 1.04-5.9, p = 0.041), and neurological diseases (OR = 2.75, 95%CI: 1.15-6.56, p = 0.023) were all independent risk factors for FF."
"21241646","Auditory training and challenges associated with participation and compliance.","BACKGROUND: When individuals have hearing loss, physiological changes in their brain interact with relearning of sound patterns. Some individuals utilize compensatory strategies that may result in successful hearing aid use. Others, however, are not so fortunate. Modern hearing aids can provide audibility but may not rectify spectral and temporal resolution, susceptibility to noise interference, or degradation of cognitive skills, such as declining auditory memory and slower speed of processing associated with aging. Frequently, these deficits are not identified during a typical &quot;hearing aid evaluation.&quot; Aural rehabilitation has long been advocated to enhance communication but has not been considered time or cost-effective. Home-based, interactive adaptive computer therapy programs are available that are designed to engage the adult hearing-impaired listener in the hearing aid fitting process, provide listening strategies, build confidence, and address cognitive changes. Despite the availability of these programs, many patients and professionals are reluctant to engage in and complete therapy.PURPOSE: The purposes of this article are to discuss the need for identifying auditory and nonauditory factors that may adversely affect the overall audiological rehabilitation process, to discuss important features that should be incorporated into training, and to examine reasons for the lack of compliance with therapeutic options. Possible solutions to maximizing compliance are explored.CONCLUSIONS: Only a small portion of audiologists (fewer than 10%) offer auditory training to patients with hearing impairment, even though auditory training appears to lower the rate of hearing aid returns for credit. Patients to whom auditory training programs are recommended often do not complete the training, however. Compliance for a cohort of home-based auditory therapy trainees was less than 30%. Activities to increase patient compliance to auditory training protocols are proposed."

Four non-hearing-impaired students did not complete the survey and their responses were excluded from the final analysis. Data was analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (version 11.0).RESULTS: Seventy-eight hearing-impaired and non 74 non-hearing impaired students completed the survey. Thirty (38.5%) hearing-impaired and 67 (90.5%) and non-hearing-impaired students knew that HIV could be transmitted via semen, vaginal fluid and blood, (p &lt; 0.001). HIV/AIDS knowledge scores were calculated giving minimum and maximum scores of 0 and 15 respectively. Mean knowledge score for hearing-impaired students was 4.7(±2.1) compared with 8.7(±2.3) among non-hearing-impaired students (t-test=11.307, p &lt; 0.001). Generally, the students' attitudes to HIV/AIDS prevention and PLWHA were not favorable with only hearing-impaired and 44 (59.5%) non-hearing-impaired students agreeing that it would be alright for them to be in the same class with someone who had AIDS.CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that the hearing-impaired students had poorer knowledge and attitudes to HIV/AIDS compared with their non-hearing-impaired counterparts. There is a pressing need for development of HIV/AIDS education programmes specially designed to meet the needs of hearing impaired students."

Seventy percent of participants reported having long-term health problems or disabilities in addition to visual impairment and 43% reported having hearing difficulties. Seventy one percent reported using LVAs for reading tasks. Participants who had become registered as visually impaired in the previous 8 years (n = 395) were asked questions about non-medical information received in the eye clinic around that time. Reported information received included advice about 'registration' (48%), low vision aids (45%) and social care routes (43%); 17% reported receiving no information. While 70% of people were satisfied with the information received, this was lower for those of working age (56%) compared with retirement age (72%). Those who recalled receiving additional non-medical information and advice at the time of registration also recalled their experiences more positively.CONCLUSIONS: Whilst caution should be applied to the accuracy of recall of past events, the data provide a valuable insight into the types of information and support that visually impaired people feel they would benefit from in the eye clinic."

"23152235","Sound therapy (masking) in the management of tinnitus in adults.","BACKGROUND: This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 12, 2010.Tinnitus is described as the perception of sound or noise in the absence of real acoustic stimulation. Numerous management strategies have been tried for this potentially debilitating, heterogeneous symptom. External noise has been used as a management tool for tinnitus, in different capacities and with different philosophical intent, for over a century.OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of sound-creating devices (including hearing aids) in the management of tinnitus in adults. Primary outcome measures were changes in the loudness or severity of tinnitus and/or impact on quality of life. Secondary outcome measures were change in pure-tone auditory thresholds and adverse effects of treatment. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 8 February 2012.SELECTION CRITERIA: Prospective randomised controlled trials recruiting adults with persistent, distressing, subjective tinnitus of any aetiology in which the management strategy included maskers, noise-generating device and/or hearing aids, used either as the sole management tool or in combination with other strategies, including counselling.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently examined the 387 search results to identify studies for inclusion in the review, of which 33 were potentially relevant. The update searches in 2012 retrieved no further potentially relevant studies. Both authors extracted data independently.MAIN RESULTS: Six trials (553 participants) are included in this review. Studies were varied in design, with significant heterogeneity in the evaluation of subjective tinnitus perception, with different scores, scales, tests and questionnaires as well as variance in the outcome measures used to assess the improvement in tinnitus sensation/quality of life. This precluded meta-analysis of the data. There was no long-term follow-up. We assessed the risk of bias as medium in three and high in three studies. Following analysis of the data, no significant change was seen in the loudness of tinnitus or the overall severity of tinnitus following the use of sound therapy compared to other interventions such as patient education, 'relaxation techniques', 'tinnitus coping strategies', counselling, 'tinnitus retraining' and exposure to environmental sounds. No side effects or significant morbidity were reported from the use of sound-creating devices.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The limited data from the included studies failed to show strong evidence of the efficacy of sound therapy in tinnitus management. The absence of conclusive evidence should not be interpreted as evidence of lack of effectiveness. The lack of quality research in this area, in addition to the common use of combined approaches (hearing therapy plus counselling) in the management of tinnitus are, in part, responsible for the lack of conclusive evidence. Other combined forms of management, such as tinnitus retraining therapy, have been subject to a Cochrane Review. Optimal management may involve multiple strategies."

However, current knowledge is limited, particularly from low-income countries where affordability is an issue. The objective was therefore to explore the relation between outcomes of assistive technology use and user involvement in the service delivery process in Bangladesh.METHODS: Using structured interviews, data from 136 users of hearing aids and 149 users of manual wheelchairs were collected. Outcomes were measured using the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA), which was adapted for wheelchair users. Predictors of user involvement included preference, measurement and training.RESULTS: Users reported outcomes comparable to those found in other high- and low-income countries. User involvement increased the likelihood for reporting better outcomes except for measurement among hearing aid users.CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the provision of assistive technology as a strategy to improve the participation of people with disabilities in society. They also support current policies and guidelines for user-involvement in the service delivery process. Simplified strategies for provision of hearing aids may be explored."
"22992413","Assistive technology use and human rights enjoyment: a cross-sectional study in Bangladesh.","BACKGROUND: About half a billion people with disabilities in developing countries have limited access to assistive technology. The Convention on the Rights of persons with Disabilities requires governments to take measures to ensure provision of such technologies. To guide implementation of these measures there is a need for understanding health outcomes from a human rights perspective. The objective of this study was therefore to explore the relation between assistive technology use and enjoyment of human rights in a low-income country.METHODS: Data was collected in eight districts of Bangladesh through interviews of people with hearing impairments using and not using hearings aids, and people with ambulatory impairments using and not using manual wheelchairs (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>583). Using logistic regression, self-reported outcomes on standard of living, health, education, work, receiving information and movement were analyzed.RESULTS: The adjusted likelihood of reporting greater enjoyment of human rights was significantly higher among people using hearing aids compared to non-users for all outcomes except working status. Compared to non-users, users of wheelchairs reported a significantly higher adjusted likelihood of good ambulatory performance and a significantly lower adjusted likelihood of reporting a positive working status. Further analyses indicated that physical accessibility to working places and duration of wheelchair use had a statistically significant impact on the likelihood of reporting positive work outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the notion that assistive technology use increases the likelihood of human rights enjoyment, particularly hearing aid use.

Participants were asked to follow instructions provided within the booklets to complete common HA tasks (e.g., cleaning the HA and mold and changing the battery) and demonstrate understanding of information. Participants' views of the booklets were then obtained within a short individual interview.RESULTS: Participants experienced problems in completing all tasks while following instructions provided by the Danalogic and Unitron booklets. Individual interviews highlighted further issues regarding layout, diagrams, and content, including missing information.CONCLUSIONS: Some HA instruction booklets contain information that some users may find difficult to find, understand, and follow. These limitations may negatively impact on HA satisfaction and use. It is recommended that written information for clients be evaluated prior to use. This study supports the premise that performance-based usability and literature testing are appropriate methods to use."

The evaluation begins with a definition of the research questions followed by a detailed search of the literature and then a review of the relevant studies. Four features of self-fitting hearing aids are reviewed: in-situ threshold measurement, whether an initial fitting prescribed using standard prescription formulae will approximate user preferences, outcomes with training of hearing aids for preferred responses, and assembly and use of the aids. There is at least good quality evidence suggesting that in-situ thresholds can be reliably obtained, that prescribed initial fittings approximate preferred responses, and that users are able to train the hearing aids and would prefer the trained responses. However, evidence on other outcomes and the ability of users to assemble and use such instruments is limited. Gaps in research with self-fitting hearing aids are identified."

In interviews and a focus group, members of South African organizations for d/Deaf and hard of hearing individuals all gave priority to HIV/AIDS education and prevention, citing risks resulting from language and communication barriers, inadequate schooling, and insufficient information in South African Sign Language. Participants gave varied descriptions of HIV/AIDS programs in schools for d/Deaf and hard of hearing students and described school initiatives they had directed. Some participants gave mental health problems lesser priority; others said susceptibility to mental disorders may result from communication difficulties and therefore warrants specialized services. Others, seeing a need to address mental health in HIV/AIDS prevention, had designed programs accordingly. Such prevention efforts merit support, as do activities to reduce communication barriers."

"22389434","Assembly and insertion of a self-fitting hearing aid: design of effective instruction materials.","A self-fitting hearing aid has been proposed as a viable option to meet the need for rehabilitation in areas where audiology services are unreliable. A successful outcome with a self-fitting hearing aid pivots in part on the clarity of the instructions accompanying the device. The aims of this article are (a) to review the literature to determine features that should be incorporated into written health-care materials and factors to consider in the design process when developing written instructions for a target audience of older adults and (b) to apply this information to the development of a set of written instructions as the first step in self-fitting of a hearing aid, assembling four parts and inserting the aid into the ear. The method involved a literature review of published peer reviewed research. The literature revealed four steps in the development of written health-care materials: planning, design, assessment of suitability, and pilot testing. Best practice design principles for each step were applied in the development of instructions for how to assemble and insert a hearing aid. Separate booklets were developed for the left and right aids and the content of each consisted of simple line drawings accompanied by captions. The reading level was Grade 3.5 equivalent and the Flesch Reading Ease Score was 91.1 indicating that the materials were &quot;very easy&quot; to read. It is essential to follow best practice design principles when developing written health-care materials to motivate the reader, maximize comprehension, and increase the likelihood of successful application of the content."

"22353681","A comparison of benefit and economic value between two sound therapy tinnitus management options.","BACKGROUND: Sound therapy coupled with appropriate counseling has gained widespread acceptance in the audiological management of tinnitus. For many years, ear level sound generators (SGs) have been used to provide masking relief and to promote tinnitus habituation. More recently, an alternative treatment device was introduced, the Neuromonics Tinnitus Treatment (NTT), which employs spectrally-modified music in an acoustic desensitization approach in order to help patients overcome the disturbing consequences of tinnitus. It is unknown, however, if one treatment plan is more efficacious and cost-effective in comparison to the other. In today's economic climate, it has become critical that clinicians justify the value of tinnitus treatment devices in relation to observed benefit.PURPOSE: To determine perceived benefit from, and economic value associated with, two forms of sound therapy, namely, SGs and NTT.RESEARCH DESIGN: Retrospective between-subject clinical study.STUDY SAMPLE: A sample of convenience comprised of 56 patients drawn from the Tinnitus Management Clinic at the Cleveland Clinic participated. Twenty-three patients selected SGs, and 33 patients selected NTT as their preferred sound therapy treatment option.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Sound therapy benefit was quantified using the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI). The questionnaire was administered before and 6 mo after initiation of tinnitus treatment. Prior to device fitting, all patients participated in a 1.5 hr group education session about tinnitus and its management. Economic value comparisons between sound therapy options were made using a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and cost-utility analysis (CUA).RESULTS: THI scores indicated a significant improvement (p &lt; 0.001) in tinnitus reduction for both treatment types between a pre- and 6 mo postfitting interval, yet there were no differences (p &gt; 0.05) between the treatment alternatives at baseline or 6 mo postfitting. The magnitude of improvement for both SGs and NTT was dependent on initial perceived tinnitus handicap. Based on the CEA and CUA economic analyses alone, it appears that the SGs may be the more cost-effective alternative; however, the magnitude of economic value is a function of preexisting perceived tinnitus activity limitation/participation restriction.CONCLUSIONS: Both SGs and NTT provide significant reduction in perceived tinnitus handicap, with benefit being more pronounced for those patients having greater tinnitus problems at the beginning of therapy. Although the economic models favored the SGs over the NTT, there are several other critical factors that clinicians must take into account when recommending a specific sound therapy option. These include initial tinnitus severity complaints and a number of patient preference variables such as sound preference, listening acceptability, and lifestyle."
"22212765","A randomized, controlled trial of the short-term effects of complementing an educational program for hearing aid users with telephone consultations.","BACKGROUND: Audiologic rehabilitation aims to improve communication for people with hearing impairment. Education is widely regarded as an integral part of rehabilitation, but the effect of the delivery method of an educational program on the experience of hearing problems has rarely been investigated in controlled trials.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the short-term effects of complementing an educational program for hearing aid users with telephone consultations, delivered through weekly discussions with the subjects about information obtained from a book on hearing and hearing aids.RESEARCH DESIGN: This study used a randomized, controlled design.STUDY SAMPLE: In total, 69 hearing aid users were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n<U+200A>=<U+200A>33) or a control group (n<U+200A>=<U+200A>36).INTERVENTION: The intervention group had access to a book and received weekly topic-based reading instructions related to the different chapters of the book. Five telephone calls were made to the members of the intervention group. During the calls, an audiologist discussed new information with the participant as needed. The control participants also read the book, but they did not discuss the contents of the book with a professional.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA) were used to measure the outcomes of this study.RESULTS: Participants in the intervention group had a reduction in self-reported hearing handicap, while there were no significant changes in the control group. In the intervention group, 45% of the participants showed an improvement of =36% on the HHIE, while only 17% of the control group showed an improvement of =36%. There were also improvements on the HADS total and the depression subscale for the intervention group. No changes occurred on the IOI-HA.CONCLUSIONS: Reading about hearing and hearing aids can reduce the hearing handicap and reported anxiety in hearing aid users. In this study, discussing the content of the book that was provided with a professional during weekly telephone consultations and having weekly home assignments further improved emotional well-being, as demonstrated by the HHIE (emotional scale) and HADS (depression scale), but these activities had no effect on hearing aid outcomes as measured by the IOI-HA."

"24179104","Evaluation of a computer-guided curriculum using animation, visual images, and voice cues to train patients for peritoneal dialysis.","BACKGROUND: Training patients to perform peritoneal dialysis (PD) at home is key to good patient outcomes. Currently, no validated curriculum based on education concepts is available in the public domain, and training is not standardized. Few nurses are prepared to be effective trainers. The present study was designed to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of PD training using a new cycler designed with animation, visual images, and voice cues and provided by a qualified PD nurse with a standardized script to guide the trainer. <U+2662>METHODS: The study recruited 40 participants, including individuals naive to dialysis and current automated PD (APD) patients. Participants with visual, hearing, or touch impairments were purposely included to reflect the disabilities common to the general APD population. The participants encompassed a range of self-reported computer and technical experience and education levels. Experienced training nurses trained each participant, one on one, for 4 - 8 hours during a single day; the nurses followed the standardized script as the participants progressed through the cycler training curriculum. The pace of training was adjusted to meet individual abilities and needs. Participants were evaluated by the training nurse at the end of the training session for their proficiency in meeting the learning objectives. <U+2662>RESULTS: All 40 participants completed the 1-day training and successfully met all task objectives by the end of the day. Participant ages ranged from 23 to 73 years (mean: 53.8 ± 11 years), with the women (50 ± 12 years) being significantly younger than the men (57 ± 9 years, p = 0.05). Among the participants, 90% had visual impairments; 40%, hearing impairments; and 45%, touch impairments. Twenty-nine participants (73%) had multiple impairments. Median training time was 7 ± 0.13 hours, with a range of 5 - 8.25 hours. We found no correlation between the number of hours needed for successful training and age (r = 0.30). Training time did not differ significantly by sex, disability, computer or technical experience, or education level. The required training time was less for participants with previous PD experience (6.5 ± 0.7 hours) than for those naive to dialysis (7 ± 0.8 h), but at p = 0.056, the difference just missed being statistically significant. <U+2662>CONCLUSIONS: The most striking finding is that, despite a variety of barriers to learning, all 40 participants were able to meet all the stated objectives of the study with 4 - 8 hours of training. Ability to meet the study objectives was not less for participants with limited education or limited technical or computer experience than for those with more education or more advanced technical and computer skills. Thus, the highly technical aspect of the new cycler is able to promote learning for a wide range of learners. The cycler provides automated instruction using audio, video, and animation, and those features, combined with a qualified training nurse using a standardized script, appear to be both efficient and effective."
"24093449","Why do some women know more? An exploration of the association of community socioeconomic characteristics, social capital, and HIV/AIDS knowledge.","The objective of this study was to investigate the associations of community-level socio-economic status (SES) characteristics and social capital with women's knowledge of HIV/AIDS. We used a representative national sample of 6,771 women ages 15-49 years from the Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey of 2007. We extended the findings of prior studies by providing new evidence that both community and social capital were related to having knowledge of AIDS. The significant community characteristics associated with women's greater knowledge of AIDS were: women's higher mean age at first marriage, higher mean years of education, the higher percentage of women in the community who work, and higher mean household living standard in the community. Regardless of individual-level SES, living in a community with higher community-level SES and having greater social capital were associated with having a greater likelihood of hearing about AIDS. However, we found that once women knew about AIDS, not all of the community-SES and social capital indicators explained their advanced knowledge of AIDS prevention and transmission. Our findings underscore the importance of HIV/AIDS education campaigns in the disadvantaged communities, specifically targeting women who are not members in any non-governmental organizations, as well as greater use of media in educating women about AIDS.

Our pilot study was designed to improve medic performance in accurately placing a large bore catheter to release tension pneumothorax (prehospital setting) while using augmented reality goggles. Thirty-four preclinical medical students recruited from Morehouse School of Medicine performed needle decompressions on human cadaver models after hearing a brief training lecture on tension pneumothorax management. Clinical vignettes identifying cadavers as having life-threatening tension pneumothoraces as a consequence of improvised explosive device attacks were used. Study group (n = 13) performed needle decompression using augmented reality goggles whereas the control group (n = 21) relied solely on memory from the lecture. The two groups were compared according to their ability to accurately complete the steps required to decompress a tension pneumothorax. The medical students using augmented reality goggle support were able to treat the tension pneumothorax on the human cadaver models more accurately than the students relying on their memory (p &lt; 0.008). Although the augmented reality group required more time to complete the needle decompression intervention (p = 0.0684), this did not reach statistical significance. "
"23879593","Gender differences in predictors of colorectal cancer screening uptake: a national cross sectional study based on the health belief model.","BACKGROUND: Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is rapidly rising in Asia, but screening uptake remains poor. Although studies have reported gender differences in screening rates, there have been few studies assessing gender specific perceptions and barriers towards CRC screening, based on behavioral frameworks. We applied the Health Belief Model to identify gender-specific predictors of CRC screening in an Asian population.METHODS: A nationwide representative household survey was conducted on 2000 subjects aged 50 years and above in Singapore from 2007 to 2008. Screening behaviour, knowledge and beliefs on CRC screening were assessed by face-to-face structured interviews. The response rate was 88.2%.RESULTS: 26.7 percent had undergone current CRC screening with no gender difference in rates. Almost all agreed that CRC would lead to suffering (89.8%), death (84.6%) and would pose significant treatment cost and expense (83.1%). The majority (88.5%) agreed that screening aids early detection and cure but only 35.4% felt susceptible to CRC. Nearly three-quarters (74.3%) of the respondents recalled reading or hearing information on CRC in the print or broadcast media. However, only 22.6% were advised by their physicians to undergo screening. Significantly more women than men had feared a positive diagnosis, held embarrassment, pain and risk concerns about colonoscopy and had friends and family members who encouraged screening. On multivariate analysis, screening uptake showed a positive association with worry about contracting CRC and a physician's recommendation and a negative association with perceived pain about colonoscopy for both genders. For women only, screening was positively associated with having attended a public talk on CRC and having a family member with CRC, and was negatively associated with Malay race and perceived danger of colonoscopy.CONCLUSIONS: CRC screening remains poor despite high levels of awareness of its benefits in this Asian population. Race, worry about contracting cancer, psychological barriers, and cues from the doctor and a public talk on CRC were associated with screening with gender specific differences. Strategies to increase CRC screening uptake should consider gender specific approaches to address psychological barriers and increase disease susceptibility through public health education and active promotion by physicians."

"23659867","Internet access and use in adults with hearing loss.","BACKGROUND: The future rehabilitation of adults with hearing loss is likely to involve online tools used by individuals at home. Online tools could also be useful for people who are not seeking professional help for their hearing problems. Hearing impairment is a disability that increases with age, and increased age is still associated with reduced use of the Internet. Therefore, to continue the research on online audiological rehabilitative tools for people with hearing loss, it is important to determine if and to what extent adults with hearing loss use the Internet.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of the Internet and email in a group of adults with hearing loss and to investigate if their use of Internet and email differed between genders, among different age groups, and how it compared with the general population in Sweden.METHODS: Questionnaires containing multiple-choice questions about Internet access, email use, and educational level were mailed to individuals with hearing loss, who were registered as patients at a hearing aid clinic. Out of the 269 invited participants, 158 returned a completed questionnaire, which was a response rate of 58.7%.RESULTS: The results showed that 60% (94/158) of the participants with hearing loss used computers and the Internet. The degree of hearing loss in the group of participants did not explain the level of Internet usage, while factors of age, gender, and education did (P&lt;.001). More men than women used the Internet (OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.32-4.91, P&lt;.001). Use of the Internet was higher in the youngest age group (25-64 years) compared to the oldest age group (75-96 years, P=.001). A higher usage of the Internet was observed in the participants with hearing loss, especially the elderly, when compared with the general population of Sweden (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.23-3.17, P=.04).CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the use of computers and the Internet overall is at least at the same level for people with hearing loss as for the general age-matched population in Sweden, but that this use is even higher in specific age groups. These results are important for the future work in developing and evaluating rehabilitative educational online tools for adults with hearing loss."
"23654396","Effect of spectral change enhancement for the hearing impaired using parameter values selected with a genetic algorithm.","Chen et al. [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 131, 2987-2998 (2012)] evaluated the effectiveness of an algorithm for enhancing spectral changes over time in improving the intelligibility of speech in background sounds for hearing-impaired subjects. The processing improved intelligibility for speech in steady speech-spectrum noise (SSN) but tended to impair intelligibility in a background of two-talker speech (TTS). Large individual differences were found. The present study assessed whether the effectiveness of the algorithm was improved when the parameters that controlled the degree and type of enhancement were chosen individually for each subject, using a genetic algorithm based on subjective preferences for speech clarity. The parameter values selected by the genetic algorithm varied markedly across subjects. Speech intelligibility was measured for unprocessed stimuli and stimuli processed using the selected parameters, with SSN and TTS maskers and two signal-to-masker ratios (SMRs) for each subject. The intelligibility of speech in the SSN masker at the lower SMR was improved about 14 percentage points by the processing. The overall improvement produced by the processing was significantly larger than the improvement observed in the previous study when the parameter values were fixed across subjects, indicating that use of the genetic algorithm was beneficial."
"23597370","Unmet hearing health care needs: the Beaver Dam offspring study.","OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the use of hearing health care services (hearing testing and hearing aids) by adults aged 21 to 84 years.METHODS: Hearing was tested and medical and hearing health histories were obtained as part of the Beaver Dam Offspring Study between 2005 and 2008 (n = 3285, mean age = 49 years).RESULTS: Of the cohort, 34% (55% of participants aged = 70 years) had a hearing test in the past 5 years. In multivariate modeling, older age, male gender, occupation, occupational noise, and having talked with a doctor about a hearing problem were independently associated with having had a hearing test in the past 5 years. Hearing aid use was low among participants with a moderate to severe hearing impairment (22.5%) and among participants with a hearing handicap (8.6%), as determined by the Hearing Handicap Inventory.CONCLUSIONS: Data support the need for improvement in hearing health care. Hearing aids' effectiveness is limited if patients do not acquire them or do not use them once acquired. Future research should focus on developing effective strategies for moving patients from diagnosis to treatment."
"23575461","Real-life efficacy and reliability of training a hearing aid.","OBJECTIVES: Commercial trainable hearing aids (HA) (i.e., devices that for a period are adjusted by the user in different acoustic environments and that subsequently with changing environments automatically adapt to the user's preferred settings), are readily available; however, little information exists about the efficacy of training a HA. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and reliability of training a HA in everyday environments.DESIGN: The participants were 26 hearing-impaired volunteers with a median age of 79 years and an average pure-tone average of 53 dB HL. Test devices were commercial, multimemory, prototype devices that enabled training of the compression characteristics in four frequency bands and in six sound classes. Participants wore the National Acoustic Laboratories nonlinear fitting procedure version 2 prescription for 3 weeks and trained the devices from the prescribed response for 3 weeks, before comparing their trained response with the prescription for 2 weeks. The devices were reset to the prescription, and 19 participants repeated the training and comparison trials. During the comparison trial, participants made daily diary ratings of their satisfaction with the programs, and a structured interview was completed at the end of the comparison trial.RESULTS: The participants displayed different needs for changing the prescription, with more daily adjustments leading to training across more sound classes. Unreliable observations were obtained from 8 participants after each of the test and retest comparison trials. Of the 10 participants who made sufficient changes to the prescription during the first trial, 80% preferred their trained response. The 8 &quot;low trainers&quot; reported no preference, and also reported lower overall satisfaction with the device. Fewer adjustments were made during the repeat trial, resulting in less training. Significant correlations between trained variations were seen for 63% of 19 participants. Of the 10 participants who provided valid data after both comparison trials, those who trained the device consistently generally showed consistent preferences, and vice versa.CONCLUSIONS: For those who wanted a change to the prescription, training was mostly effective. Limited data on reliability showed reasonable consistency in training outcomes and preferences. Findings, in particular on reliability, should be verified in larger populations. A guideline on how to clinically manage training with clients is presented."
"23473328","Hearing-aid assembly management among adults from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds: toward the feasibility of self-fitting hearing aids.","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was twofold: (1) to assess the ability of hearing-impaired adults in the developing world to independently and accurately assemble a pair of hearing aids by following instructions that were written and illustrated according to best-practice health literacy principles; and (2) to determine which factors influence independent and accurate task completion.DESIGN: Correlational study.STUDY SAMPLE: Forty South African and 40 Chinese adults with a hearing loss and their partners. The participant group included 42 females and 38 males ranging in age from 32 to 92 years.RESULTS: Ninety-five percent of South African and 60% of Chinese participants completed the assembly task, either on their own or with assistance from their partners. Better health literacy, younger age, and a more prestigious occupation were significantly associated with independent task completion for the South African and Chinese participants. Task accuracy was significantly linked to higher levels of cognitive function among South African participants, while a paucity of valid data prevented an analysis of accuracy from being conducted with the Chinese data.CONCLUSION: Individuals of diverse backgrounds can manage the self-fitting hearing-aid assembly task as long as health literacy levels and cultural differences are considered."

This study aimed to describe the socio-demographic characteristics and challenges faced by these patients attending University College Hospital, Ibadan.METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study design was done. A semi-structured interviewer administered questionnaire was administered to consecutive disabled PLHIV over a period of six months. Data obtained were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.RESULTS: A total of ninety-nine patients were seen during the study period. The mean age of these patients was 39.9 +/- 9.4 years (range 23-60 years). There were 30 (30.3%) males and 69 (69.7%) females. Twenty-four percent had no formal education while 12% had tertiary education. All respondents had suffered stigmatization/discrimination while most were poor. Eighty-seven percent had AIDS at presentation. Musculoskeletal impairments (46.5%), hearing loss (16.2%) and visual impairment (31.3%) were the commonest disability. Over twenty-three percent had prior history of road traffic accident as the cause of disability.CONCLUSION: Physically and mentally challenged people living with HIV/AIDS are poor and highly stigmatized. They require special assistance to cope and need economic empowerment to reduce their poverty level."
"23450887","Community attitudes about discussing sexual health: assessing public opinion of local STD prevention campaigns.","OBJECTIVES: We assessed public views about the acceptability of and need for sexually transmitted disease (STD) and sexual health-related educational messaging in local campaigns.METHODS: A 28-item state-added module was included in the 2008 New York Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey (n=3,751). Respondents rated acceptability of venues/dissemination channels and messaging and agreement with attitudinal/need statements. Additional data were analyzed from a separate state survey with individual county samples (n=36,257). We conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariable modeling analyses.RESULTS: Each venue was acceptable to more than three-quarters of respondents (range: 79% for billboards to 95% for teaching STD prevention in high school). All message areas were acceptable to at least 85% of respondents (acceptability rating range: 85% to 97%). More than 70% agreed that there is a need for more open discussion about STDs. Bivariate analyses identified areas where messaging tailored to specific subgroups may be helpful (e.g., 26% of white people, 44% of African Americans, and 45% of Hispanic people agreed with the statement, &quot;I need ideas about how to talk to my partner about protection from STDs&quot;). Little geographic variation was seen. Results of multivariable modeling on opposition showed limited interaction effects.CONCLUSION: These data provide key information about current community norms and reflect the public's approval for hearing and seeing more about sexual health and STDs in a range of public forums."
"23408375","Modern day relevance of William Hunter's approach to teaching &quot;The organ of hearing&quot;.","William Hunter, a pioneering teacher of Anatomy in the the eighteenth century, championed the use of dissected specimens as aids in the teaching of anatomy. Although Hunter promoted the Paris method of learning Anatomy, by student dissection, he also used prosected material as an adjunct to his lectures. We are fortunate that Hunter bequeathed his extensive collection of over 3,000 museum specimens to the University of Glasgow, many of which are housed in the Laboratory of Human Anatomy in the Thomson Building. Regions such as the temporal bone are frequently difficult for students, and indeed postgraduate trainees in ear nose and throat surgery, to visualize and understand. Hunter overcame this difficulty by producing elegant specimens highlighting the three-dimensional complexity of the area. The current vignette stresses the importance of Hunter in his contemporary setting, but also demonstrates the potential of his approach for current and future teaching programmes in this age of the Internet."

"23373520","Older people's views on what they need to successfully adjust to life with a hearing aid.","This article reports a study exploring what older people believe would enable them to adjust to and gain maximum benefit from wearing a hearing aid. A mixed methods approach was employed during 2006 involving interviews with key stakeholders, a survey across three Scottish health board areas and focus groups. Nine key stakeholders from six national and local organisations were interviewed about the needs of older people being fitted with hearing aids. In total, 240 older people belonging to three different types of hearing impaired older people were surveyed: long-term users of hearing aids, new hearing aid users, and those on a waiting list from urban and rural areas (response rate = 24%). A series of eight follow-up focus groups with 31 audiology patients was held. Health professionals appeared to neglect appropriate provision of information and overly rely on technological interventions. Of 154 older people already fitted with hearing aids, only 52% of hearing aid users reported receiving enough practical help post fitting and only 41% reported receiving enough support. Approximately 40% reported not feeling confident in the use of their aids or their controls. Older people wanted more information than they received both before and after hearing aid fitting. Information provision and attention to the psychosocial aspects of care are key to enabling older people to adjust and optimise hearing aid benefit."
"23311112","Follow-up after a failed newborn hearing screen: a quality improvement study.","OBJECTIVE: Universal newborn hearing screening (UNHS) has been implemented for several decades to screen for congenital hearing loss; however, the lost to follow-up (LFU) rate for newborns with a failed screen is nearly 50%. Many studies have examined risk factors rendering infants susceptible to being LFU, but there are no quality improvement studies using evidence-based practice that aim to improve follow-up rates. This study utilized a nurse practitioner (NP) to provide a teaching intervention to educate parents on recommended follow-up after a failed hearing screen, including the Healthy People 2020 objectives.METHODS: Seventeen newborn/mother couplets were recruited to participate in a multi-site quality improvement project over a six week period prior to hospital discharge. At the bedside with the NP, mothers completed a demographic survey and were provided education on Georgia's UNHS Program and recommended follow-up based on the Healthy People 2020 objectives. An appointment with the hospital's audiologist was given to the mother in writing. A retrospective chart review was performed three months after the newborn's birth to document follow-up with audiology or to see if the infant was lost to follow-up for audiologic evaluation (LFUAE).RESULTS: Of the 17 newborns enrolled, 14 had adequate follow-up with audiology within three months of birth. Hospital A showed statistical significance with one newborn that was LFUAE when compared to the nation LFU rate (n=12, p=0.01). Prior to project intervention, Hospital B had a 70% LFUAE rate; however, its post intervention LFUAE rate decreased to 40% (n=5). Statistical significance was unable to be obtained due to small sample size. Two mothers reported smoking during pregnancy and both of their newborns were LFUAE.CONCLUSIONS: This project suggests that education by the NP prior to hospital discharge was statistically significant at Hospital A. Health care providers should actively engage in educating parents regarding expected follow-up guidelines and incorporating the Healthy People 2020 objectives. Further studies are needed that can also examine the six month follow-up with pediatric otolaryngology for hearing aid fitting and early intervention."
"25538617","The effect of functional hearing loss and age on long- and short-term visuospatial memory: evidence from the UK biobank resource.","The UK Biobank offers cross-sectional epidemiological data collected on &gt;500,000 individuals in the UK between 40 and 70 years of age. Using the UK Biobank data, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of functional hearing loss and hearing aid usage on visuospatial memory function. This selection of variables resulted in a sub-sample of 138,098 participants after discarding extreme values. A digit triplets functional hearing test was used to divide the participants into three groups: poor, insufficient and normal hearers. We found negative relationships between functional hearing loss and both visuospatial working memory (i.e., a card pair matching task) and visuospatial, episodic long-term memory (i.e., a prospective memory task), with the strongest association for episodic long-term memory. The use of hearing aids showed a small positive effect for working memory performance for the poor hearers, but did not have any influence on episodic long-term memory. Age also showed strong main effects for both memory tasks and interacted with gender and education for the long-term memory task. Broader theoretical implications based on a memory systems approach will be discussed and compared to theoretical alternatives. "
"25401727","Hearing aid use in everyday life: managing contextual variability.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We investigated usage of and satisfaction with hearing aid devices in everyday life among older adults with hearing loss. Our research further advances the role of hearing contexts for hearing aid use and satisfaction. A central assumption was that hearing aid owners adapt the usage of the hearing aid devices to contextual demands of hearing depending on their personal resources.METHODS: In a sample of 158 hearing aid owners aged 50-88 years, we examined proactive hearing aid use in everyday life and its association with the usage of, and satisfaction with, hearing aids. The study was administered online. Using an adapted version of the day-reconstruction method, participants reported hearing episodes during the preceding day. Hearing aid use was assessed via the proportion of waking time with hearing aids. Satisfaction with hearing aids was measured via the Satisfaction with Daily Amplification scale.RESULTS: When using the hearing aids more often, and when reporting greater satisfaction, older adults indicated more diverse listening situations and experienced less variability in hearing quality with hearing aids.CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that hearing aid owners may proactively use the hearing devices to master situation-specific demands and difficulties in hearing quality. Such findings underline that hearing aid use and satisfaction depend on the extent to which the devices help to manage everyday life successfully."
"25365367","What is important for hearing aid satisfaction? Application of the expectancy-disconfirmation model.","BACKGROUND: Between 68.1-89.5% of clients report that they are satisfied with their hearing aids. Two variables that are thought to contribute to dissatisfaction with hearing aids are product performance, and a mismatch between performance and client prefitting expectations about hearing-aid performance (i.e., disconfirmation). A focus on variables related to satisfaction is relevant to improving hearing rehabilitation services.PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine if measures of hearing-aid performance and disconfirmation, specifically related to hearing ability and hearing-aid problems, were associated with overall hearing-aid satisfaction among a sample of hearing-aid users.RESEARCH DESIGN: A retrospective research design was employed.STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 123 individuals participated in the study (57% male; mean age: 72 yr). All participants owned hearing aids.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A personal details questionnaire and the Profile of Hearing Aid Consumer Satisfaction questionnaire (Wong et al, 2009) were completed by participants, 3-12 mo after they obtained hearing aids. Overall hearing-aid satisfaction was a dichotomized variable (satisfaction vs. dissatisfaction); therefore, logistic regression modeling was applied to the data to determine which variables were associated with overall hearing-aid satisfaction.RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of the sample reported that they were satisfied with their hearing aids. Hearing-aid satisfaction was associated with the ability to hear with hearing aids and better-than-expected performance in this same area; fewer hearing-aid problems; and fewer problems with hearing-aid manipulation, hearing-aid appearance, and wearer discomfort than were anticipated before hearing-aid fitting.CONCLUSIONS: It is recommended that to improve hearing-aid satisfaction, clinicians should ensure optimal hearing-aid benefit in the listening situations that the person with hearing impairment most wants to hear better; reduce the likelihood of hearing-aid problems occurring; and promote positive disconfirmation (performance exceeds expectations) with respect to both hearing ability and hearing-aid performance through the education of clients about the likely benefits of hearing aids in a variety of listening environments, and the potential problems they could face with hearing-aid manipulation and wearer discomfort."

We determined the prevalence of sensorineural hearing loss among HIV-exposed newborns and the association between the hearing threshold and maternal and newborn parameters.DESIGN: A cohort audiometric study of newborns between October 2012 and April 2013.SETTINGS: A secondary and tertiary hospital-based study.PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive 126 HIV-exposed and 121 HIV-unexposed newborns.INTERVENTION: Hearing screening of the newborns was done with Auditory Brainstem Response and compared with maternal HAART, CD4 cell counts, RNA viral loads and newborn CD4 cell count percentage.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Hearing threshold levels of both groups were measured and analysed.RESULTS: Around 11.1% of HIV-exposed and 6.6% of unexposed newborns had hearing impairment (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.2214). About 6.4% of HIV-exposed and 2.5% HIV-unexposed newborns had hearing threshold of more than 20<U+200A>dBHL (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.1578). There was no significant association between the hearing thresholds of HIV-exposed newborns and maternal CD4 cell counts (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.059) but there was with maternal viral load (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.034). There was significant difference between the hearing thresholds of HIV-exposed newborns with CD4% of 25 or less and more than 25. This study showed significant difference in the hearing of the 119 HAART-exposed newborns and seven unexposed newborns [P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.002; risk ratio, 0.13 (0.05-0.32)].CONCLUSION: There was a trend towards more hearing loss in HIV-exposed newborns. However, hearing thresholds increase with increasing mothers' viral load. The background information supports the need for further studies on the role of in-utero exposure to HIV and HAART in newborn hearing loss."

"25267134","Communicating with assistive listening devices and age-related hearing loss: Perceptions of older Australians.","Abstract Age-related hearing loss can impact adversely on the delivery of primary care and cannot necessarily be remedied by hearing aid technology. A study of 20 older Australians living in a Queensland retirement village and residential hostel complex was undertaken to investigate how communication might be advanced through an assistive listening device (ALD). Most participants were women aged over 85 years; almost all had hearing loss and wore hearing aids. Tests with an ALD found very high levels of satisfaction with understanding speech and sound quality amongst participants. However, few had heard previously of ALDs, all required individualised assistance to fit and use the device and rated ease of use less highly. The findings affirm those of previous studies that ALD technology has a role in communication for older hearing impaired people and for hearing rehabilitation. Its potential to enhance quality of life can be facilitated and promoted through nursing practice, but requires professional and consumer education so that it is not overlooked as a communication option.

"25262671","Perceptions of adults with hearing impairment regarding the promotion of trust in hearing healthcare service delivery.","OBJECTIVE: This paper describes how trust is promoted in adults with hearing impairment within the context of hearing healthcare (HHC) service delivery.DESIGN: Data were analysed from a previously published descriptive qualitative study that explored perspectives of adults with hearing impairment on hearing help-seeking and rehabilitation.STUDY SAMPLE: Interview transcripts from 29 adults from four countries with different levels of hearing impairment and different experience with the HHC system were analysed thematically.RESULTS: Patients enter into the HHC system with service expectations resulting in a preconceived level of trust that can vary from low to high. Relational competence, technical competence, commercialized approach, and clinical environment (relevant to both the clinician and the clinic) influence a patient's resulting level of trust.CONCLUSIONS: Trust is evolving rather than static in HHC: Both clinicians and clinics can promote trust. The characteristics of HHC that engender trust are: practicing good communication, supporting shared decision making, displaying technical competence, offering comprehensive hearing rehabilitation, promoting self-management, avoiding a focus on hearing-aid sales, and offering a professional clinic setting."
"25229213","A metasynthesis of patient-provider communication in hospital for patients with severe communication disabilities: informing new translational research.","Poor patient-provider communication in hospital continues to be cited as a possible causal factor in preventable adverse events for patients with severe communication disabilities. Yet to date there are no reports of empirical interventions that investigate or demonstrate an improvement in communication in hospital for these patients. The aim of this review was to synthesize the findings of research into communication in hospital for people with severe communication disabilities arising from lifelong and acquired stable conditions including cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual disability, aphasia following stroke, but excluding progressive conditions and those solely related to sensory impairments of hearing or vision. Results revealed six core strategies suggested to improve communication in hospital: (a) develop services, systems, and policies that support improved communication, (b) devote enough time to communication, (c) ensure adequate access to communication tools (nurse call systems and communication aids), (d) access personally held written health information, (e) collaborate effectively with carers, spouses, and parents, and (f) increase the communicative competence of hospital staff. Currently there are no reports that trial or validate any of these strategies specifically in hospital settings. Observational and evaluative research is needed to investigate the ecological validity of strategies proposed to improve communication."
"25211767","Validation of a novel combination hearing aid and tinnitus therapy device.","OBJECTIVES: Most patients with tinnitus also have hearing loss. Hearing aids have been well-documented to provide amelioration for both hearing and tinnitus problems. Some hearing aids have built-in noise/sound generators that are intended to provide added benefit to patients with tinnitus. It has not been proven, however, whether these &quot;combination instruments&quot; are more effective for tinnitus management than hearing aids alone. The purpose of this study was to collect initial data addressing this question.DESIGN: Thirty individuals meeting study requirements (bothersome tinnitus, hearing aid candidate, and no use of hearing aids for the previous 12 months) were enrolled. All participants initially completed the primary outcome questionnaire (Tinnitus Functional Index [TFI]) and then returned to be fitted with combination instruments. The hearing aid portion of the devices was adjusted to optimize hearing ability. Participants were then randomized to either the experimental group (n = 15) or the control group (n = 15). The experimental group had the noise feature of the instruments activated and adjusted to achieve optimal relief from tinnitus. The control group did not have the noise portion activated. Following the hearing aid fitting, all study participants also received brief tinnitus counseling. Participants returned 1 to 2 weeks later for a follow-up appointment to confirm proper fit of the instruments and to make any necessary programming adjustments. Additionally, they returned 3 months after the fitting to complete the TFI, which also concluded their participation in the study.RESULTS: Both groups revealed significant improvement, as indicated by reductions in mean TFI index scores. Differences between groups at 3 months were not statistically significant. However, the experimental group showed a mean reduction in the TFI score that was 6.4 points greater than that for the control group. The difference approached significance (p = 0.09), suggesting that a larger group of participants may have resulted in a significant difference between groups. This possibility is tempered by the fact that effect sizes, which control for variation, were very similar between groups.CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest that the use of hearing aids alone or hearing aids plus the use of sound generators both provide significant benefit with respect to alleviating effects of tinnitus. A larger controlled clinical trial is needed to obtain more definitive results regarding the two configurations of hearing aids."
"25140321","Screening of cognitive function and hearing impairment in older adults: a preliminary study.","BACKGROUND: Previous research has found that hearing loss is associated with poorer cognitive function. The question is that when a hearing impairment is being compensated for by appropriately fitted monaural hearing aids, special precautions are still needed when screening cognitive function in older adults.OBJECTIVE: This research examined cognitive function in elderly hearing aid users who used monaural hearing aids and whether the presence of a hearing impairment should be accounted for when screening cognitive function in these individuals.METHODS: Auditory thresholds, sentence reception thresholds, and self-reported outcomes with hearing aids were measured in 34 older hearing aid users to ensure hearing aids were appropriately fitted. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) results obtained in these participants were then compared to normative data obtained in a general older population exhibiting similar demographic characteristics. Stepwise multiple regression analyses were used to examine the effects of demographic and auditory variables on MMSE scores.CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that, even with appropriately fitted hearing aids, cognitive decline was significant. Besides the factors commonly measured in the literature, we believed that auditory deprivation was not being fully compensated for by hearing aids. Most importantly, screening of cognitive function should take into account the effects of hearing impairment, even when hearing devices have been appropriately fitted."

Given that adolescents are particularly affected, scalable, and cost-effective prevention programs are urgently needed. This study aims to identify opportunities to integrate technology into youth HIV prevention efforts. In 2012, 1107 8th-11th graders completed a paper-and-pencil survey. Respondents were enrolled in one of three public high schools in Langa, a lower income community in Cape Town, South Africa. Eighty-nine percent of respondents have used text messaging (SMS) and 86% have gone online. If an HIV prevention program was offered online, 66% of youth would be somewhat or extremely likely to access it; slightly fewer (55%) felt the same about SMS-based programming. In comparison, 85% said they would be somewhat or extremely likely to access a school-based HIV prevention program. Interest in Internet- (60%) and SMS-based (54%) HIV prevention programming was similar for youth who had a self-appraised risk of HIV compared to youth who appraised their risk to be lower, as it was for youth who were tired of hearing messages about HIV prevention. Technology use is common - even among high school students who live in lower income communities. At the same time, these data reveal that it is not uncommon for youth to be tired of hearing messages about HIV prevention, and many of the typical topics key to HIV prevention have low interest levels among youth. HIV prevention researchers need to be mindful of the extent of existing programming that youth are exposed to. Technology-based programming may be especially amenable to meeting these requirements because of its novelty especially in developing countries, and because interactive functionality can be easily integrated into the program design. Given the preference for school- and Internet-based programming, it seems that a hybrid approach is likely feasible and acceptable. "

The HSEM consisted of: (1) standard pure-tone audiometry; (2) discussion of hearing loss and implications of dual sensory impairment; and (3) provision of information on hearing services and facilitated referral. Those with hearing loss who did not own hearing aids, reported low use (&lt;1 hr/day), or used a single aid with bilateral loss were referred for full assessment by an audiologist and to the follow-up arm of the study (n = 210).

Help-seekers had higher mean hearing handicap scores at baseline compared with non-help-seekers. The majority of help-seekers (85.3%) underwent a complete hearing assessment. Fifty-four percent (n = 37) were recommended hearing aids and the majority of these (n = 27) obtained new hearing aids. Seven participants had existing aids adjusted, and 3 obtained alternate assistive listening devices. Almost half of those receiving new aids or adjustments to hearing aids reported low use (&lt;1 hr/day) at follow-up. Among help-seekers, 40% were unsure or did not believe their audiologist knew of their visual diagnosis. Of concern, 60% of participants did not seek help largely due to perceptions their hearing loss was not bad enough; the presence of competing priorities; concerns over dealing with vision loss and managing hearing aids with poor vision.CONCLUSIONS: Hearing- and vision-rehabilitation services need to better screen for, and take account of, dual sensory impairment among their older clients. If audiologists are made more aware of visual conditions affecting their clients, they may be better placed to facilitate access to appropriate technologies and rehabilitation, which may improve aid retention and benefit."
"24828222","A preliminary evaluation of the active communication education program in a sample of 87-year-old hearing impaired individuals.","BACKGROUND: Previous research suggests that audiological rehabilitation for older adults could include group communication programs in addition to hearing aid fitting or as an alternative to hearing aid fitting for those people who do not wish to proceed with hearing aids. This pilot study was a first attempt to evaluate a Swedish version of such a program, Active Communication Education (ACE), which had been developed and previously evaluated in Australia (Hickson et al, 2007a).PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to explore the use of the ACE program in an older-old population of people aged 87 yr in Sweden.RESEARCH DESIGN: A within-subject intervention study.STUDY SAMPLE: The participants were recruited from the Elderly in Linköping Screening Assessment (ELSA), a population-based study of the functional abilities of all inhabitants of the city of Linkoping aged 85 yr in 2007. Participants who responded to the hearing related items in the ELSA study were approached for this study; 29 people agreed to undertake ACE, and 23 (79%) completed three or more sessions.INTERVENTION: The ACE program consists of five weekly 2 hr group sessions with six to ten participants per group.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Self-report measures of communication strategy use, activity and participation, health-related quality of life, and depression were obtained preprogram, 3 wk postprogram, and 6 mo postprogram. Within-group changes and effect sizes were calculated. In addition, outcomes were measured postprogram using the International Outcome Inventory-Alternative Interventions (IOI-AI; Noble, 2002) and a modified version of the Client Oriented Scale of Improvement (COSI; Dillon et al, 1997; Hickson et al, 2007b), and qualitative feedback was obtained.RESULTS: The effect size of ACE was small (0.03-0.27), and, in the sample of 23 included in this pilot study, differences in pre- and postprogram assessments were not statistically significant. Results from the IOI-AI and the modified COSI indicated that these elderly participants found the program to be beneficial, and 90% stated that the course had increased their ability to deal with hearing loss and the problems it creates.CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary investigation indicates the potential benefits of ACE for older adults, and further research is needed with larger numbers of participants in different age groups to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the ACE program for a general Swedish population."
"24827385","Successful engagement: CBM's holistic approach to the work in the area of ear care, deafness, hard of hearing and deafblindness.","PURPOSE: CBM is an international Christian development organisation, committed to improving the quality of life of persons with disabilities in disadvantaged societies. CBM aims at achieving this in partnership with local organisations and in cooperation with stakeholders at regional and international levels. This article aims at sharing CBM's holistic approach for successful engagement in the work area of ear care, deafness, hard of hearing and deafblindness.METHODS: Review of CBM supporting documents, including strategies, position papers, technical guidelines, criteria of success and information related to partners, centres of excellence and model projects.RESULTS: Description of how partner programmes use participatory methods of planning and implementation, involving persons with disabilities and the community. Recommendations on how to develop national or sub-national strategies to impact the lives, and advocate with governments for the rights and inclusion, of persons with disabilities.CONCLUSIONS: CBM's holistic approach to work in the area of ear care; deafness; hard of hearing and deafblindness includes intervention at all levels of health care provision, Education, CBR and Audiological, Speech Therapy and other interdisciplinary services. This article presents CBM's core principles and shares specific strategic planning and results, together with lessons learnt while searching a sustainable engagement for field work.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: Rehabilitation, in its widest conception, should be approached as a multidisciplinary strategy, and developed in close cooperation with other local, national and international agencies. CBM is positioned in a strategic point from where it can play a key role in the facilitation of an international forum for agencies and stakeholders to reach a consensus to decrease the burden of ear disease and hearing loss, through early intervention and re/habilitation."
"24810978","Effects of policy changes to universal newborn hearing screening follow-up in a university clinic.","PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of policy changes on loss to follow-up rates and the ability to achieve the goals of the American Academy of Pediatrics Joint Committee on Infant Hearing Screening (2007) for diagnosis of hearing loss by 3 months, amplification within 1 month of diagnosis, and start of intervention by 6 months.METHOD: From the files of 111 infants, data were extracted on the following: date of birth, birth hospital, hometown, parents' ages, ethnicity, nursery status, medical history, age at initial evaluation and diagnosis, results of evaluation(s), and age at hearing aid fitting and start of early intervention. Data were compared with previously published data from the clinic (Krishnan, 2009).RESULTS: Policy changes led to a decrease in loss to follow-up and a younger age at diagnosis of hearing loss. Infants identified with hearing loss were fit with amplification at younger ages but not within 1 month of diagnosis of hearing loss. Policy changes had positive outcomes on loss to follow-up and age of diagnosis and amplification.CONCLUSIONS: Challenges remain in meeting the goals of amplification within 1 month of diagnosis and documenting the start of early intervention. Improved communication between and education of all parties involved in the care of infants is needed."
"24752284","Benefits of phoneme discrimination training in a randomized controlled trial of 50- to 74-year-olds with mild hearing loss.","OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to (i) evaluate the efficacy of phoneme discrimination training for hearing and cognitive abilities of adults aged 50 to 74 years with mild sensorineural hearing loss who were not users of hearing aids, and to (ii) determine participant compliance with a self-administered, computer-delivered, home- and game-based auditory training program.DESIGN: This study was a randomized controlled trial with repeated measures and crossover design. Participants were trained and tested over an 8- to 12-week period. One group (Immediate Training) trained during weeks 1 and 4. A second waitlist group (Delayed Training) did no training during weeks 1 and 4, but then trained during weeks 5 and 8. On-task (phoneme discrimination) and transferable outcome measures (speech perception, cognition, self-report of hearing disability) for both groups were obtained during weeks 0, 4, and 8, and for the Delayed Training group only at week 12.RESULTS: Robust phoneme discrimination learning was found for both groups, with the largest improvements in threshold shown for those with the poorest initial thresholds. Between weeks 1 and 4, the Immediate Training group showed moderate, significant improvements on self-report of hearing disability, divided attention, and working memory, specifically for conditions or situations that were more complex and therefore more challenging. Training did not result in consistent improvements in speech perception in noise. There was no evidence of any test-retest effects between weeks 1 and 4 for the Delayed Training group. Retention of benefit at 4 weeks post-training was shown for phoneme discrimination, divided attention, working memory, and self-report of hearing disability. Improved divided attention and reduced self-reported hearing difficulties were highly correlated.CONCLUSIONS: It was observed that phoneme discrimination training benefits some but not all people with mild hearing loss. Evidence presented here, together with that of other studies that used different training stimuli, suggests that auditory training may facilitate cognitive skills that index executive function and the self-perception of hearing difficulty in challenging situations. The development of cognitive skills may be more important than the development of sensory skills for improving communication and speech perception in everyday life. However, improvements were modest. Outcome measures need to be appropriately challenging to be sensitive to the effects of the relatively small amount of training performed."

"24702607","Hearing assistive technologies in developing countries: background, achievements and challenges.","PURPOSE: The burden of hearing impairment and disability is substantial in the developing world. This review outlines the associated need for amplification devices in low and medium income countries and some of the initiatives that have been taken to improve access to such devices, particularly hearing aids. The main observed barriers to access are listed and possible ways to improve access are considered.METHODS: Prevalence estimates for disabling hearing impairment are reviewed and a number of national and international examples of initiatives to facilitate use of hearing assistive devices in low and medium income countries are provided. Technologies that are potentially appropriate for hearing instruments in developing countries are suggested, as well as fitting programs that are more likely to be maintained over the long term.RESULTS: Challenges to successful hearing instrument fitting in low and medium income countries are many. However, some programs point the way to improved access to such devices. Successful hearing aid fitting programs in developing countries have typically combined appropriate technology with a sustainable local support base.CONCLUSIONS: With a rising middle class in many developing countries, advances in technology, and ongoing training programs for those involved in amplification fitting, hearing device usage rates may eventually reach parity with those in developed economies.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: The historical development of affordable hearing device fitting provision in low and middle income countries is outlined. Three key barriers to widespread access to hearing device provision in many low and middle income countries (LMICs) are identified: lack of trained personnel, the high cost of many existing devices marketed in LMICs and limited public awareness of the benefits of hearing assistive technologies. Examples of programs that have sought to overcome these barriers in LMICs are given and may influence the ways in which future hearing health care is provided."
"24695796","A systematic review of ethics knowledge in audiology (1980-2010).","PURPOSE: The purpose of this research was to apply multiple perspectives as part of a systematic review to analyze literature regarding ethics in audiology. Audiologists are particularly vulnerable to the changing requirements of the discipline that compel them to straddle both professional obligations and business principles, creating a hybrid professional.METHOD: The authors used a 2-phase mixed-method approach to analyze publications. Publications were sorted into categories, namely, ethics approach, author, decade, role of the audiologist, component of morality, and common themes. The sample consisted of peer-reviewed articles cited in MEDLINE, CINAHL, ERIC, MasterFILE Premier, E-Journals, Africa-Wide Information, and Academic Search Premier electronic databases and non-peer-reviewed articles in Seminars in Hearing.RESULTS: The publications were predominantly philosophical, focused on the rehabilitative role of the audiologist, and addressed the moral judgment component of moral behavior.CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fact that knowledge of ethics grew between 1980 and 2010, this retrospective analysis identified gaps in current knowledge. Research is needed to address the unique ethical problems commonly encountered in all 8 roles of the audiologist; patient perspectives on ethics; ethical approaches; factors affecting moral judgment, sensitivity, motivation, and courage; and cultural dimensions of ethical practice in audiology."
"24687123","Adult hearing screening: health policy issues--what happens next?","PURPOSE: Ten percent of adults in England have some type of hearing loss and would greatly benefit from hearing aids or other forms of hearing management. However, 76% of these adults do not have hearing aids or other management. The impact of this unmet need can be substantial and has been linked to depression, social isolation, employment problems, loss of independence, and dementia. This article explores how hearing screening-universal, targeted, or opportunistic-can address prevalent, incident, and future needs for hearing services as well as better define the extent of need.METHOD: Adults age =60 years living at home in England took part in a health survey, part of which was to determine the extent of need for hearing services in this population. Survey methods included a face-to-face interview and hearing screening using pure tones as well as a self-report questionnaire on other health issues.RESULTS: The survey highlighted additional hearing-related factors that will enable referral decisions in primary care to be made with reasonable confidence that patients will use hearing aids and benefit from them. Some relevant nonhearing factors are also reported.CONCLUSION: There is a growing aging population with increasing needs and expectations for hearing services. Targeted screening and triage in primary care, as well as use of advanced technologies, are discussed for the future."
"24622861","Sound therapy for tinnitus management: practicable options.","BACKGROUND: The authors reviewed practicable options of sound therapy for tinnitus, the evidence base for each option, and the implications of each option for the patient and for clinical practice.PURPOSE: To provide a general guide to selecting sound therapy options in clinical practice.INTERVENTION: Practicable sound therapy options.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Where available, peer-reviewed empirical studies, conference proceedings, and review studies were examined. Material relevant to the purpose was summarized in a narrative.RESULTS: The number of peer-reviewed publications pertaining to each sound therapy option reviewed varied significantly (from none to over 10). Overall there is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of individual sound therapy options. It is likely, however, that sound therapy combined with education and counseling is generally helpful to patients.CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians need to be guided by the patient's point of care, patient motivation and expectations of sound therapy, and the acceptability of the intervention both in terms of the sound stimuli they are to use and whether they are willing to use sound extensively or intermittently. Clinicians should also clarify to patients the role sound therapy is expected to play in the management plan."
"24602838","[Auditory rehabilitation programmes for adults: what do we know about their effectiveness?].","INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Hearing loss ranks third among the health conditions that involve disability-adjusted life years. Hearing aids are the most commonly used treatment option in people with hearing loss. However, a number of auditory rehabilitation programmes have been developed with the aim of improving communicative abilities in people with hearing loss. The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness of auditory rehabilitation programmes focused on communication strategies.MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a narrative revision. A literature search using PUBMED was carried out. This search included systematic reviews investigating the effectiveness of auditory training and individual and group auditory rehabilitation programmes with the main focus on counselling and communicative strategies for adults with hearing loss. Each study was analysed in terms of the type of intervention used and the results obtained.RESULTS: Three articles were identified: one article about the effectiveness of auditory training programmes and 2 systematic reviews that investigated the effectiveness of communicative programmes in adults with hearing loss. The &quot;Active Communication Education&quot; programme appears to be an effective group programme of auditory rehabilitation that may be used with older Spanish-speaking adults.CONCLUSIONS: The utility of hearing aid fitting and communicative programmes as rehabilitation options are associated with improvements in social participation and quality of life in patients with hearing loss, especially group auditory rehabilitation programmes, which seem to have good potential for reducing activity limitations and social participation restrictions, and thus for improving patient quality of life."
"24597938","Using intersectionality to explore experiences of disability and HIV among women and men in Zambia.","PURPOSE: Little is known about the experiences of people with disabilities (PWD) who live with HIV. Existing research largely assumes a &quot;double burden&quot; approach, which views HIV as doubling the load for people already burdened by disability. Intersectionality (a dynamic process of converging systems of relationships) offers an alternative approach for understanding differences in experience. This study uses an intersectional approach to explore the experiences of PWD in Zambia who have become HIV-positive.METHODS: We conducted semi-structured, in depth interviews with 21 PWD who live with HIV in Zambia (12 women, 9 men). Participants had various impairments (visual, hearing, mobility, intellectual). Interviews were conducted to meet participants' accessibility preferences.RESULTS: Our intersectional analysis demonstrates the dynamic and situational emergent meanings and consequences for PWD who are living with HIV related to: (1) meanings of HIV and disability linked with time and trajectory; (2) oppression and negotiation related to accessing health services and (3) social roles and relationships. Three case studies illustrate these circumstances.CONCLUSIONS: Intersectionality offers a complementary approach for examining the complex interrelationship among HIV, disability, gender and time among PWD living with HIV. Findings illustrate directions for improved services and policies for this important group.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: Rehabilitation services need to take a cross-disability (multiple disabilities) approach working with people living with HIV and disability. Rehabilitation, as illustrated by a CBR approach, needs to include services that will facilitate not only health, but education, jobs and housing for people living with HIV and disability. Rehabilitation needs to make more direct connections with Zambia social service sector to help address the fluctuating experience of living with HIV and disability."
"24484316","Communicating with Assistive Listening Devices and Age-Related Hearing Loss: Perceptions of Older Australians.","Abstract Age-related hearing loss can impact adversely on the delivery of primary care and cannot necessarily be remedied by hearing aid technology. A study of 20 older Australians living in a Queensland retirement village and residential hostel complex was undertaken to investigate how communication might be advanced through an assistive listening device (ALD). Most participants were women aged over 85 years; almost all had hearing loss and wore hearing aids. Tests with an ALD found very high levels of satisfaction with understanding speech and sound quality amongst participants. However, few had heard previously of ALDs, all required individualised assistance to fit and use the device and rated ease of use less highly. The findings affirm those of previous studies that ALD technology has a role in communication for older hearing-impaired people and for hearing rehabilitation. Its potential to enhance quality of life can be facilitated and promoted through nursing practice, but requires professional and consumer education so that it is not overlooked as a communication option."
"24463415","[Complications in hearing aid fitting without otolaryngologist expertise].","BACKGROUND: Hearing loss is a symptom. The underlying disease must be investigated by an otolaryngologist, in order to ensure timely identification of alterations in disease course, complications and newly occurring secondary disease.METHODS: During the course of 1 year, 484 case studies in which treatment errors had arisen due to lack of otolaryngologist involvement during hearing aid fitting were collected from 115 practices and 7 ENT clinics, as well as from the patient representatives of the Federal Joint Committee. Depending on the type and cause of the individual complications, these were classified into five groups and described cumulatively.RESULTS: A total of 484 cases in which results had been incorrectly interpreted or charged to the wrong payer organization were presented in the form of a systematic overview. Furthermore, serious technical deficits, as well as unnecessary temporary and inappropriate fittings were observed.CONCLUSION: The aforementioned cases are interpreted on the basis of regulations governing hearing aid fitting and current legal practices. These case reports clearly demonstrate that otolaryngologist expertise are required not only at the first hearing aid fitting, but also for subsequent fittings, in order to appropriately treat the underlying disease. Only so can the patient be protected from damage to their health and financial complications, and health insurance providers avoid wasting resources."
"26305441","Infection prevention and control measures currently applied in South African audiology.","BACKGROUND: To counter the global increase in infection-related deaths, infection control has recently developed into an active area of research. Many diseases can be prevented by infection control. In the confines of the audiology clinic, cross-contamination by micro-organisms associated with opportunistic infections remains a real concern.OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of the study was to ascertain the methods that audiologists in South Africa use to prevent and control the spread of infections during and after consultation with clients.METHOD: A survey study was conducted, using a self-administered questionnaire. Fifty currently practising audiologists participated in the study.RESULTS: The majority (84%; n = 42) of respondents acknowledged the importance of hand hygiene for the purpose of infection control, with 76% (n = 38) making use of no-rinse hand sanitisers. Approximately a third of audiologists wear gloves during procedures such as otoscopy and immittance, and while handling hearing aids. Disinfecting audiological equipment seem to be the preferred choice of infection control, with only 60% (n = 30) of respondents sterilising audiological equipment after each individual patient consultation. Less than half of the respondents disinfected touch surfaces and toys in the reception area.CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, further education and training should focus on measures implemented in infection control, awareness of possible risk factors at work settings, and vaccination as an effective means of infection control."
"25992058","Sensitivity and specificity of portable hearing screening in middle-aged and older adults.","Introduction Hearing screening allows the identification of individuals with hearing loss. Aim To determine the sensitivity and specificity of a portable hearing screening device in middle-aged and older adults using the manufacturer scoring and a scoring system proposed by the researchers. Methods In this transversal study, participants underwent anamnesis, otoscopy, and hearing screening using portable equipment. After this, a pure tone audiometry was performed, with participants classified into two groups: with and without hearing loss. The sensitivity and specificity of the hearing screening were calculated for the right and left ears using two methods of interpretation: the original method recommended by the manufacturer (criteria 1) and the method proposed by researchers (criteria 2). Results The sample consisted of 55 individuals, 83.6% (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>46) of whom were women. Per criteria 1, the sensitivities were 26.3 (right ear) and 21.4% (left ear). The specificity was 100% for both ears. Using criteria 2, the sensitivity was 94.7 (right ear) and 100% (left ear). The specificity was 74.3 (right ear) and 65.9% (left ear). Conclusion This study showed that the criteria proposed by the manufacturer presented low sensitivity in the hearing screening. The criteria proposed by the researchers to achieve a more efficient performance reached high and balanced values for sensitivity and specificity. "
"26681267","Visual Access in Interpreter-Mediated Learning Situations for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing High School Students Where an Artifact Is in Use.","This article highlights interpreter-mediated learning situations for deaf high school students where such mediated artifacts as technical machines, models, and computer graphics are used by the teacher to illustrate his or her teaching. In these situations, the teacher's situated gestures and utterances, and the artifacts will contribute independent pieces of information. However, the deaf student can only have his or her visual attention focused on one source at a time. The problem to be addressed is how the interpreter coordinates the mediation when it comes to deaf students' visual orientation. The presented discourse analysis is based on authentic video recordings from inclusive learning situations in Norway. The theoretical framework consists of concepts of role, footing, and face-work (Goffman, E. (1959). The presentation of self in everyday life. London, UK: Penguin Books). The findings point out dialogical impediments to visual access in interpreter-mediated learning situations, and the article discusses the roles and responsibilities of teachers and educational interpreters."
"26649541","Information Retention and Overload in First-Time Hearing Aid Users: An Interactive Multimedia Educational Solution.","PURPOSE: An educational intervention to improve knowledge of hearing aids and communication in first-time hearing aid users was assessed. This intervention was based on the concept of reusable learning objects (RLOs).METHOD: A randomized controlled trial was conducted. One group received the educational intervention, and the other acted as a control group. RLOs were delivered online and through DVD for television and personal computer. Knowledge of both practical and psychosocial aspects of hearing aids and communication was assessed using a free-recall method 6 weeks postfitting.RESULTS: Knowledge of both practical and psychosocial issues was significantly higher in the group that received the RLOs than in the control group. Moderate to large effect sizes indicated that these differences were clinically significant.CONCLUSION: An educational intervention that supplements clinical practice results in improved knowledge in first-time hearing aid users."
"26649539","The Process of Developing an Internet-Based Support System for Audiologists and First-Time Hearing Aid Clients.","BACKGROUND: In audiologic practice, complementary information sources and access to the clinician between appointments improve information retention and facilitate adjustment behaviors.

"26649538","Internet Interventions for Hearing Loss.","PURPOSE: The purpose of the two studies presented in this research forum article was to develop audiological rehabilitation programs for experienced hearing aid users and evaluate them in online versions. In this research forum article, the differences between the two studies are discussed.METHOD: Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were performed evaluating the efficacy of online rehabilitation, including professional guidance by an audiologist. In each RCT, the effects of the online programs were compared with the effects measured in a control group.RESULTS: The results from the first RCT showed a significant increase in activity and participation for both groups with participants in the intervention group improving more than those in the control group. At the 6-month follow-up, after the study, the significant increase was maintained; however, amounts of increase in the two groups were no longer significantly different. The results from the second RCT showed significant increase in activity and participation for the intervention group, although the control group did not improve.CONCLUSIONS: The results from the RCTs provide evidence that the Internet can be used to deliver rehabilitation to hearing-aid users and that their problems are reduced by the intervention; however, the content of the online rehabilitation program requires further investigation."
"26604726","Social representation of &quot;hearing loss&quot;: cross-cultural exploratory study in India, Iran, Portugal, and the UK.","BACKGROUND: Hearing loss is one of the most common chronic conditions in older adults. In audiology literature, several studies have examined the attitudes and behavior of people with hearing loss; however, not much is known about the manner in which society in general views and perceives hearing loss. This exploratory study was aimed at understanding the social representation of hearing loss (among the general public) in the countries of India, Iran, Portugal, and the UK. We also compared these social representations.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved a cross-sectional design, and participants were recruited using the snowball sampling method. A total of 404 people from four countries participated in the study. Data were collected using a free-association task where participants were asked to produce up to five words or phrases that came to mind while thinking about hearing loss. In addition, they were also asked to indicate if each word they presented had positive, neutral, or negative associations in their view. Data were analyzed using various qualitative and quantitative methods.RESULTS: The most frequently occurring categories were: assessment and management; causes of hearing loss; communication difficulties; disability; hearing ability or disability; hearing instruments; negative mental state; the attitudes of others; and sound and acoustics of the environment. Some categories were reported with similar frequency in most countries (eg, causes of hearing loss, communication difficulties, and negative mental state), whereas others differed among countries. Participants in India reported significantly more positive and fewer negative associations when compared to participants from Iran, Portugal, and the UK. However, there was no statistical difference among neutral responses reported among these countries. Also, more differences were noted among these countries than similarities.CONCLUSION: These findings provide useful insights into the public perception of hearing loss that may prove useful in public education and counseling."
"26567594","Knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and practices related to chronic suppurative otitis media and hearing impairment in Pokhara, Nepal.","BACKGROUND: Nepal has a high prevalence of chronic suppurative otitis media and hearing impairment. An improved understanding of patients' knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and practices is therefore important for effective healthcare planning and intervention.METHOD: Questionnaires designed to explore their current knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and practices were completed by 153 participants: 71 were affected by a known ear disease and 82 were unaffected.RESULTS: In the unaffected group, 31.7 per cent considered breast milk to be a risk factor for ear infection. Home remedies (e.g. leaf paste, oils, and urine and/or bodily fluids) had been used by 42.3 per cent of the affected group. Most participants (71.9 per cent) believed that society discriminates against those with hearing impairment.CONCLUSION: Knowledge deficits and false beliefs were found in both groups, along with a significant use of home remedies and a perception of discrimination against people with hearing impairment. These findings are relevant for healthcare providers and may aid the development of policy, interventions and public education initiatives."
"26565785","A Randomized Controlled Trial to Evaluate the Benefits of a Multimedia Educational Program for First-Time Hearing Aid Users.","OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to (1) develop a series of short interactive videos (or reusable learning objects [RLOs]) covering a broad range of practical and psychosocial issues relevant to the auditory rehabilitation for first-time hearing aid users; (2) establish the accessibility, take-up, acceptability and adherence of the RLOs; and (3) assess the benefits and cost-effectiveness of the RLOs.DESIGN: The study was a single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial with two arms. The intervention group (RLO+, n = 103) received the RLOs plus standard clinical service including hearing aid(s) and counseling, and the waitlist control group (RLO-, n = 100) received standard clinical service only. The effectiveness of the RLOs was assessed 6-weeks posthearing aid fitting. Seven RLOs (total duration 1 hr) were developed using a participatory, community of practice approach involving hearing aid users and audiologists. RLOs included video clips, illustrations, animations, photos, sounds and testimonials, and all were subtitled. RLOs were delivered through DVD for TV (50.6%) and PC (15.2%), or via the internet (32.9%).RESULTS: RLO take-up was 78%. Adherence overall was at least 67%, and 97% in those who attended the 6-week follow-up. Half the participants watched the RLOs two or more times, suggesting self-management of their hearing loss, hearing aids, and communication. The RLOs were rated as highly useful and the majority of participants agreed the RLOs were enjoyable, improved their confidence and were preferable to written information. Postfitting, there was no significant between-group difference in the primary outcome measure, overall hearing aid use. However, there was significantly greater hearing aid use in the RLO+ group for suboptimal users. Furthermore, the RLO+ group had significantly better knowledge of practical and psychosocial issues, and significantly better practical hearing aid skills than the RLO- group.CONCLUSIONS: The RLOs were shown to be beneficial to first-time hearing aid users across a range of quantitative and qualitative measures. This study provides evidence to suggest that the RLOs may provide valuable learning and educational support for first-time hearing aid users and could be used to supplement clinical rehabilitation practice."
"26560239","Attentional modulation of informational masking on early cortical representations of speech signals.","To recognize speech in a noisy auditory scene, listeners need to perceptually segregate the target talker's voice from other competing sounds (stream segregation). A number of studies have suggested that the attentional demands placed on listeners increase as the acoustic properties and informational content of the competing sounds become more similar to that of the target voice. Hence we would expect attentional demands to be considerably greater when speech is masked by speech than when it is masked by steady-state noise. To investigate the role of attentional mechanisms in the unmasking of speech sounds, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to a syllable masked by noise or competing speech under both active (the participant was asked to respond when the syllable was presented) or passive (no response was required) listening conditions. The results showed that the long-latency auditory response to a syllable (/bi/), presented at different signal-to-masker ratios (SMRs), was similar in both passive and active listening conditions, when the masker was a steady-state noise. In contrast, a switch from the passive listening condition to the active one, when the masker was two-talker speech, significantly enhanced the ERPs to the syllable. These results support the hypothesis that the need to engage attentional mechanisms in aid of scene analysis increases as the similarity (both acoustic and informational) between the target speech and the competing background sounds increases.

"26557701","Over-the-Counter Hearing Aids: A Lost Decade for Change.","BACKGROUND: Hearing aids sold directly to consumers in retail stores or through the internet, without individual prescription by audiological professionals, are termed over-the-counter (OTC) devices. This study aimed to determine whether there was any change in the electroacoustic characteristics of OTC devices compared to research carried out a decade earlier. The previous results indicated that most OTC devices were low-frequency-emphasis devices and were unsuitable for elderly people with presbycusis, who were likely to be the major consumers of these products.METHODS: Ten OTC devices were selected and their electroacoustic performance was measured. Appropriate clients for the OTC devices were derived, using four linear prescription formulae, and OTC suitability for elderly persons with presbycusis was investigated.RESULTS: OTC electroacoustic characteristics were similar to those in the earlier study. Most OTC devices were not acoustically appropriate for potential consumers with presbycusis. Although several of the devices could match prescriptive targets for individuals with presbycusis, their poor electroacoustic performance--including ineffective volume control function, high equivalent input noise, and irregular frequency response--may override their potential benefit.CONCLUSION: The low-cost OTC devices were generally not suitable for the main consumers of these products, and there has been little improvement in the appropriateness of these devices over the past decade."

Data were analyzed using a content analysis to identify the most-similar categories of responses reported, a co-occurrences analysis to see which of these categories are reported commonly, and a chi-square analysis to study if there was any association between positive, neutral, and negative connotations among participants in different countries.RESULTS: The current study revealed four different social representations of hearing aids from India, Iran, Portugal, and the United Kingdom, and also a global index.CONCLUSION: The study results provide very useful insights into how hearing aids are represented in the society. These findings may have important implications for public education and also for manufacturers from the viewpoint of designing and marketing hearing aids in different countries."
"26480972","Self-Reported Hearing Loss, Hearing Aids, and Cognitive Decline in Elderly Adults: A 25-Year Study.","OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between hearing loss, hearing aid use, and cognitive decline.DESIGN: Prospective population-based study.SETTING: Data gathered from the Personnes Agées QUID study, a cohort study begun in 1989-90.PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 65 and older (N = 3,670).MEASUREMENTS: At baseline, hearing loss was determined using a questionnaire assessing self-perceived hearing loss; 137 subjects reported major hearing loss, 1,139 reported moderate problems (difficulty following the conversation when several persons talk at the same time or in a noisy background), and 2,394 reported no hearing trouble. Cognitive decline was measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), administered at follow-up visits over 25 years.RESULTS: Self-reported hearing loss was significantly associated with lower baseline MMSE score (ß = -0.69, P &lt; .001) and greater decline during the 25-year follow-up period (ß = -0.04, P = .01) independent of age, sex, and education. A difference in the rate of change in MMSE score over the 25-year follow-up was observed between participants with hearing loss not using hearing aids and controls (ß = -0.06, P &lt; .001). In contrast, subjects with hearing loss using a hearing aid had no difference in cognitive decline (ß = 0.07, P = .08) from controls.CONCLUSION: Self-reported hearing loss is associated with accelerated cognitive decline in older adults; hearing aid use attenuates such decline."
"26390408","Evaluation of a Modified User Guide for Hearing Aid Management.","OBJECTIVES: This study investigated if a hearing aid user guide modified using best practice principles for health literacy resulted in superior ability to perform hearing aid management tasks, compared with the user guide in the original form.DESIGN: This research utilized a two-arm study design to compare the original manufacturer's user guide with a modified user guide for the same hearing aid--an Oticon Acto behind-the-ear aid with an open dome. The modified user guide had a lower reading grade level (4.2 versus 10.5), used a larger font size, included more graphics, and had less technical information. Eighty-nine adults ages 55 years and over were included in the study; none had experience with hearing aid use or management. Participants were randomly assigned either the modified guide (n = 47) or the original guide (n = 42). All participants were administered the Hearing Aid Management test, designed for this study, which assessed their ability to perform seven management tasks (e.g., change battery) with their assigned user guide.RESULTS: The regression analysis indicated that the type of user guide was significantly associated with performance on the Hearing Aid Management test, adjusting for 11 potential covariates. In addition, participants assigned the modified guide required significantly fewer prompts to perform tasks and were significantly more likely to perform four of the seven tasks without the need for prompts. The median time taken by those assigned the modified guide was also significantly shorter for three of the tasks. Other variables associated with performance on the Hearing Aid Management test were health literacy level, finger dexterity, and age.CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that the need to design hearing aid user guides in line with best practice principles of health literacy as a means of facilitating improved hearing aid management in older adults."
"26269098","The effects of an Audio Visual Assisted Therapy Aid for Refractory auditory hallucinations (AVATAR therapy): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: Psychological interventions which adopt an explicitly interpersonal approach are a recent development in the treatment of distressing voices. AVATAR therapy is one such approach which creates a direct dialogue between a voice-hearer and a computerised representation of their persecutory voice (the avatar) through which the person may be supported to gain a sense of greater power and control. The main objective of the trial is to test the clinical efficacy of this therapy to reduce the frequency and severity of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH). Secondary objectives of the study are to explore explanatory mechanisms of action and potential moderators, to carry out a qualitative evaluation of participants' experience and to conduct an economic evaluation.DESIGN: The AVATAR randomised clinical trial will independently randomise 142 participants to receive either 7 sessions of AVATAR therapy or supportive counselling (SC). The study population will be individuals with schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders who report hearing persistent distressing voices, for more than 12 months, which are unresponsive or only partially responsive to antipsychotic medication. The main hypotheses are that, compared to SC, AVATAR therapy will reduce the frequency and severity of AVH and will also reduce the reported omnipotence and malevolence of these voices. Assessments will occur at 0 weeks (baseline), 12 weeks (post-intervention) and 24 weeks (follow-up), and will be carried out by blinded assessors. Both interventions will be delivered in a community-based mental health centre. Therapy competence and adherence will be monitored in both groups. Statistical analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle and data will be analysed using a mixed (random) effects model at each post treatment time point separately. A formal mediation and moderator analysis using contemporary causal inference methods will be conducted as a secondary analysis. The trial is funded by the Welcome Trust (WT).DISCUSSION: AVATAR therapy showed promising effects in a pilot study, but the efficacy of the approach needs to be examined in a larger randomised clinical trial before wider dissemination and implementation in mental health services.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled TrialsISRCTN: 65314790 , registration date: 27 March 2013."
"26262032","Web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids.","INTRODUCTION: Adults and elderly users of hearing aids suffer psychosocial reactions as a result of hearing loss. Auditory rehabilitation is typically carried out with support from a speech therapist, usually in a clinical center. For these cases, there is a lack of computer-based self-training tools for minimizing the psychosocial impact of hearing deficiency.OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids.METHODS: Two modules were developed for the web system: an information module based on guidelines for using hearing aids; and an auditory training module presenting a sequence of training exercises for auditory abilities along the lines of the auditory skill steps within auditory processing. We built aweb system using PHP programming language and a MySQL database .from requirements surveyed through focus groups that were conducted by healthcare information technology experts. The web system was evaluated by speech therapists and hearing aid users. An initial sample of 150 patients at DSA/HRAC/USP was defined to apply the system with the inclusion criteria that: the individuals should be over the age of 25 years, presently have hearing impairment, be a hearing aid user, have a computer and have internet experience. They were divided into two groups: a control group (G1) and an experimental group (G2). These patients were evaluated clinically using the HHIE for adults and HHIA for elderly people, before and after system implementation. A third web group was formed with users who were invited through social networks for their opinions on using the system. A questionnaire evaluating hearing complaints was given to all three groups. The study hypothesis considered that G2 would present greater auditory perception, higher satisfaction and fewer complaints than G1 after the auditory training. It was expected that G3 would have fewer complaints regarding use and acceptance of the system.RESULTS: The web system, which was named SisTHA portal, was finalized, rated by experts and hearing aid users and approved for use. The system comprised auditory skills training along five lines: discrimination; recognition; comprehension and temporal sequencing; auditory closure; and cognitive-linguistic and communication strategies. Users needed to undergo auditory training over a minimum period of 1 month: 5 times a week for 30 minutes a day. Comparisons were made between G1 and G2 and web system use by G3.CONCLUSION: The web system developed was approved for release to hearing aid users. It is expected that the self-training will help improve effective use of hearing aids, thereby decreasing their rejection."
"26244401","The Effect of Functional Hearing and Hearing Aid Usage on Verbal Reasoning in a Large Community-Dwelling Population.","OBJECTIVES: Verbal reasoning performance is an indicator of the ability to think constructively in everyday life and relies on both crystallized and fluid intelligence. This study aimed to determine the effect of functional hearing on verbal reasoning when controlling for age, gender, and education. In addition, the study investigated whether hearing aid usage mitigated the effect and examined different routes from hearing to verbal reasoning.DESIGN: Cross-sectional data on 40- to 70-year-old community-dwelling participants from the UK Biobank resource were accessed. Data consisted of behavioral and subjective measures of functional hearing, assessments of numerical and linguistic verbal reasoning, measures of executive function, and demographic and lifestyle information. Data on 119,093 participants who had completed hearing and verbal reasoning tests were submitted to multiple regression analyses, and data on 61,688 of these participants, who had completed additional cognitive tests and provided relevant lifestyle information, were submitted to structural equation modeling.RESULTS: Poorer performance on the behavioral measure of functional hearing was significantly associated with poorer verbal reasoning in both the numerical and linguistic domains (p &lt; 0.001). There was no association between the subjective measure of functional hearing and verbal reasoning. Functional hearing significantly interacted with education (p &lt; 0.002), showing a trend for functional hearing to have a greater impact on verbal reasoning among those with a higher level of formal education. Among those with poor hearing, hearing aid usage had a significant positive, but not necessarily causal, effect on both numerical and linguistic verbal reasoning (p &lt; 0.005). The estimated effect of hearing aid usage was less than the effect of poor functional hearing. Structural equation modeling analyses confirmed that controlling for education reduced the effect of functional hearing on verbal reasoning and showed that controlling for executive function eliminated the effect. However, when computer usage was controlled for, the eliminating effect of executive function was weakened.CONCLUSIONS: Poor functional hearing was associated with poor verbal reasoning in a 40- to 70-year-old community-dwelling population after controlling for age, gender, and education. The effect of functional hearing on verbal reasoning was significantly reduced among hearing aid users and completely overcome by good executive function skills, which may be enhanced by playing computer games."

"26177043","Prevalence of hearing loss among Canadians aged 20 to 79: Audiometric results from the 2012/2013 Canadian Health Measures Survey.","BACKGROUND: In Canada, population-level estimates of hearing loss have been based on self-reported data, yielding estimates of 4% or 5%. Self-reported hearing difficulties may result in underestimates of hearing loss, particularly among people with mild loss and among older adults.DATA AND METHODS: The 2012/2013 Canadian Health Measures Survey (cycle 3) collected audiometric and self-reported data to estimate the prevalence of hearing loss and limitations in a population-based sample of Canadians aged 20 to 79. Weighted frequencies and cross-tabulations were used to calculate measured and self-reported hearing levels by sociodemographic characteristics. All estimates were weighted at the person-level to represent the population.RESULTS: Based on a pure-tone average of four frequencies that are important in speech, 19.2% of Canadians aged 20 to 79 had measured hearing loss in at least one ear; 35.4% had high-frequency hearing loss. These levels exceeded the self-reported estimate of hearing difficulty--3.7%--derived from responses to questions from the Health Utilities Index Mark 3. The prevalence of measured hearing loss rose with age from no more than 10% among people younger than 50 to 65% at ages 70 to 79. Men were more likely than women to have a hearing loss, a difference that emerged around age 60. Canadians with low household income and/or educational attainment were more likely than those in higher income/education households to have a hearing loss.INTERPRETATION: This analysis presents the first population-based audiometric data on the prevalence of hearing loss among the adult household population of Canada, and highlights the disparity between measured and self-reported outcomes."

Ten volunteer participants from two volunteer schemes in South West England were observed and interviewed. Three patient participants were interviewed.RESULTS: Analysis of observational data showed that volunteers provided support relating to local services and hearing aids, but did not engage in discussions about hearing loss. Interviews with volunteers identified gaps in audiology provision, including accessible services and clear information and highlighted a need for more support from audiology services to enable them to fulfil their role. Volunteer interactions with patients mimicked a clinician-patient encounter and volunteers employed strategies and behaviours used by professional audiologists.CONCLUSIONS: Audiology volunteers could provide an accessible bridge between health services and the community but their care is limited to focus on hearing aids.PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Volunteers enable patients to use hearing aids appropriately and are a core element of current care arrangements. However, volunteers express a need for adequate support from audiology services. Volunteers have the potential to increase service capacity and to bridge the gaps between community and audiology healthcare services."

Study's participants answered International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA) questionnaires. Data were analyzed descriptively and analytically with Poisson regression analysis.RESULTS: We interviewed 272 adults and 112 individuals reported not using their hearing aids regularly. The mean of IOI-HA global score was lower than expected. The individual's relationship with their hearing aid (Factor 1) was worse than the individual's relationship with their environment (Factor 2). Lower global scores were statistically associated with no work.CONCLUSIONS: The observed scores for the study's population are lower than those recorded in other studies. The results suggest that there are limitations in the fitting and follow-up of individuals who received hearing aids."
"25828269","Exposing the gaps in awareness, knowledge and estimation of risk for anal cancer in men who have sex with men living with HIV: a cross-sectional survey in Australia.","INTRODUCTION: The incidence of anal cancer is significantly higher in men who have sex with men (MSM) living with HIV when compared to the general population. We aimed to assess their awareness, knowledge and perceived level of personal risk for anal cancer to help inform educational strategies targeting this group.METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 327 HIV positive MSM in Melbourne, Australia, attending clinical settings (a sexual health centre, tertiary hospital HIV outpatients and high HIV caseload general practices) completed a written questionnaire in 2013/14. Poor knowledge was defined as those who had never heard of anal cancer, or scored 5 or less out of 10 in knowledge questions amongst those who reported ever hearing about anal cancer. Underestimation of risk was defined as considering themselves as having the same or lower risk for anal cancer compared to the general population.RESULTS: Of 72% (95% confidence interval (CI): 67-77) who had heard of anal cancer, 47% (95% CI: 41-53) could not identify any risk factors for anal cancer. Of total men surveyed, 51% (95% CI: 46-57) underestimated their risk for anal cancer. Multivariate analysis showed that men who underestimated their risk were older (OR 1.04 (per year increase in age), 95% CI: 1.01-1.07), had poor anal cancer knowledge (OR 2.06, 95% CI: 1.21-3.51), and more likely to have ever had an anal examination (OR 2.41, 95% CI: 1.18-4.93). They were less likely to consult a physician if they had an anal abnormality (OR 0.54, 95% CI: 0.31-0.96), to have had receptive anal sex (OR 0.12, 95% CI: 0.02-0.59) or speak English at home (OR 0.28, 95% CI: 0.09-0.90).CONCLUSIONS: This survey of MSM living with HIV demonstrated limited awareness, knowledge level and estimation of risk for anal cancer. Further educational and public health initiatives are urgently needed to improve knowledge and understanding of anal cancer risk in MSM living with HIV."
"25730330","Speech perception in older hearing impaired listeners: benefits of perceptual training.","Hearing aids (HAs) only partially restore the ability of older hearing impaired (OHI) listeners to understand speech in noise, due in large part to persistent deficits in consonant identification. Here, we investigated whether adaptive perceptual training would improve consonant-identification in noise in sixteen aided OHI listeners who underwent 40 hours of computer-based training in their homes. Listeners identified 20 onset and 20 coda consonants in 9,600 consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) syllables containing different vowels (/<U+0251>/, /i/, or /u/) and spoken by four different talkers. Consonants were presented at three consonant-specific signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) spanning a 12 dB range. Noise levels were adjusted over training sessions based on d' measures. Listeners were tested before and after training to measure (1) changes in consonant-identification thresholds using syllables spoken by familiar and unfamiliar talkers, and (2) sentence reception thresholds (SeRTs) using two different sentence tests. Consonant-identification thresholds improved gradually during training. Laboratory tests of d' thresholds showed an average improvement of 9.1 dB, with 94% of listeners showing statistically significant training benefit. Training normalized consonant confusions and improved the thresholds of some consonants into the normal range. Benefits were equivalent for onset and coda consonants, syllables containing different vowels, and syllables presented at different SNRs. Greater training benefits were found for hard-to-identify consonants and for consonants spoken by familiar than unfamiliar talkers. SeRTs, tested with simple sentences, showed less elevation than consonant-identification thresholds prior to training and failed to show significant training benefit, although SeRT improvements did correlate with improvements in consonant thresholds. We argue that the lack of SeRT improvement reflects the dominant role of top-down semantic processing in processing simple sentences and that greater transfer of benefit would be evident in the comprehension of more unpredictable speech material.

Audiometric data (hearing sensitivity and speech in noise) were collected.STUDY SAMPLE: Data were obtained from 123 adults with hearing impairment: 73 reported current hearing-aid use, 81 reported current hearing assistance technology use.RESULTS: In both analyses, device users had more difficulty understanding speech in background noise, had poor hearing in both their better and worse hearing ears, and perceived more consequences of hearing impairment in their everyday lives (both emotionally and socially) than non-hearing-aid users. Discriminant analyses showed that the social consequences of hearing impairment and the better ear hearing best classified hearing aid users from non-users but social consequences and worse ear hearing best classified hearing assistance technology users from non-users.CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life measurements and speech-in-noise assessments provide useful clinical information. Hearing-impaired adults in New Zealand who use hearing aids also tend to use hearing assistance technology, which has important clinical implications."
"25597459","The nature of communication throughout diagnosis and management planning in initial audiologic rehabilitation consultations.","BACKGROUND: Effective practitioner-patient communication throughout diagnosis and management planning positively influences patient outcomes. A patient-centered approach whereby patient involvement in decision making is facilitated, a therapeutic relationship is developed, and information is bilaterally exchanged in an appropriate manner, leads to improved patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment, and self-management. Despite this knowledge, little is known about the nature of audiologist-patient communication throughout diagnosis and management planning.PURPOSE: This research aimed to explore verbal communication between audiologists and patients/companions throughout diagnosis and management planning in initial audiology consultations. Specifically, this study aimed to describe the nature and dynamics of communication by examining the number, proportion, and type of verbal utterances by all speakers (audiologist, patient, and companion when present). In addition, this study aimed to investigate the influence of audiologist, patient, and consultation factors, such as verbal dominance, content balance, and communication control, on the dynamics of communication.STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 62 initial audiological rehabilitation consultations (involving 26 different audiologists) were filmed and analyzed using the Roter Interaction Analysis System. All patients were older than 55 yr, and a companion was present in 17 consultations.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: This study focused solely on the communication relating to diagnosis and management planning (referred to as the &quot;counseling phase&quot;). Diagnosis, recommendations, rehabilitation options, and patient decisions were recorded along with the communication profiles and communication dynamics measured using the Roter Interaction Analysis System. Associations between communication dynamics (content balance, communication control, and verbal dominance) and eight variables were evaluated with Linear Mixed Model methods.RESULTS: The mean length of time for diagnosis and management planning was 29.0 min (range, 2.2-78.5 min). Communication profiles revealed that patient-centered communication was infrequently observed. First, opportunities to build a relationship were missed, such that patients' psychosocial concerns were rarely addressed and patients/companions showed little involvement in management planning. Second, the amount of talk was asymmetrical and the majority of audiologists' education and counseling utterances related to hearing aids; yet, only 56% of patients decided to obtain hearing aids at the conclusion of the consultation. Hearing aids were recommended in 83% of consultations where a hearing loss was diagnosed and alternative options were rarely provided. Thus, shared decision making rarely occurred, and audiologists often diagnosed a hearing loss and recommended hearing aids without patient involvement. In addition, when a greater proportion of time was dedicated to diagnosis and management planning, patients had greater input and control by asking more questions and requesting further information.CONCLUSIONS: Patient-centered communication was rarely observed in the 62 consultations. Thus, although not measured in this study, patient outcomes are likely to be affected. Future research should examine the influence of audiologist communication on outcomes and encourage a shift toward patient-centered audiological rehabilitation."
"25597456","Factors affecting reliability and validity of self-directed automatic in situ audiometry: implications for self-fitting hearing AIDS.","BACKGROUND: A reliable and valid method for the automatic in situ measurement of hearing thresholds is a prerequisite for the feasibility of a self-fitting hearing aid, whether such a device becomes an automated component of an audiological management program or is fitted by the user independently of a clinician. Issues that must be addressed before implementation of the procedure into a self-fitting hearing aid include the role of real-ear-to-dial difference correction factors in ensuring accurate results and the ability of potential users to successfully self-direct the procedure.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of an automatic audiometry algorithm that is fully implemented in a wearable hearing aid, to determine to what extent reliability and validity are affected when the procedure is self-directed by the user, and to investigate contributors to a successful outcome.RESEARCH DESIGN: Design was a two-phase correlational study.STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 60 adults with mild to moderately severe hearing loss participated in both studies: 20 in Study 1 and 40 in Study 2. Twenty-seven participants in Study 2 attended with a partner. Participants in both phases were selected for inclusion if their thresholds were within the output limitations of the test device.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: In both phases, participants performed automatic audiometry through a receiver-in-canal, behind-the-ear hearing aid coupled to an open dome. In Study 1, the experimenter directed the task. In Study 2, participants followed a set of written, illustrated instructions to perform automatic audiometry independently of the experimenter, with optional assistance from a lay partner. Standardized measures of hearing aid self-efficacy, locus of control, cognitive function, health literacy, and manual dexterity were administered. Statistical analysis examined the repeatability of automatic audiometry; the match between automatically and manually measured thresholds; and contributors to successful, independent completion of the automatic audiometry procedure.RESULTS: When the procedure was directed by an audiologist, automatic audiometry yielded reliable and valid thresholds. Reliability and validity were negatively affected when the procedure was self-directed by the user, but the results were still clinically acceptable: test-retest correspondence was 10 dB or lower in 97% of cases, and 91% of automatic thresholds were within 10 dB of their manual counterparts. However, only 58% of participants were able to achieve a complete audiogram in both ears. Cognitive function significantly influenced accurate and independent performance of the automatic audiometry procedure; accuracy was further affected by locus of control and level of education. Several characteristics of the automatic audiometry algorithm played an additional role in the outcome.CONCLUSIONS: Average transducer- and coupling-specific correction factors are sufficient for a self-directed in situ audiometry procedure to yield clinically reliable and valid hearing thresholds. Before implementation in a self-fitting hearing aid, however, the algorithm and test instructions should be refined in an effort to increase the proportion of users who are able to achieve complete audiometric results. Further evaluation of the procedure, particularly among populations likely to form the primary audience of a self-fitting hearing aid, should be undertaken."

Cluster sampling followed by random sampling served to identify 400-500 households (HHs) with members with disabilities per country. A HH questionnaire and individual questionnaire was completed. Country level analysis was limited to descriptive statistics.</AbstractText>: A survey was done in purposively selected sites of the study countries. Cluster sampling followed by random sampling served to identify 400-500 households (HHs) with members with disabilities per country. A HH questionnaire and individual questionnaire was completed. Country level analysis was limited to descriptive statistics.Walking mobility aids was most commonly bought/provided (46.3%), followed by visual aids (42.6%). The most common sources for assistive technology were government health services (37.8%), &quot;other&quot; (29.8%), and private health services (22.9%). Out of the participants, 59.3% received full information in how to use the device. Maintenance was mostly done by users and their families (37.3%). Devices helped a lot in 73.3% of cases and improved quality of life for 67.9% of participants, while 39.1% experienced functional difficulties despite the devices.</AbstractText>: Walking mobility aids was most commonly bought/provided (46.3%), followed by visual aids (42.6%).

Implications for rehabilitation Provision of assistive technology and services varied between countries, but the overall impression was of poor provision and fragmented services. The limited provision of assistive technology for personal care and handling products is of concern as many of these devices requires little training and ongoing support while they can make big functional differences. Rural respondents experienced more difficulties when using the device and received less information on use and maintenance of the device than their urban counterparts. A lack of government responsibility for assistive device services correlated with a lack of information and/or training of participants and maintenance of devices.</AbstractText>: Although there is variation between the study settings, the main impression is that of fragmented or absent systems of provision of assistive technology.

The impact of HI on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is of great importance to aid the development of strategic plans and to guide therapeutic interventions.PURPOSE: To evaluate HRQoL in Korean adults with different degrees of HI using EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) and EQ-visual analogue scale (VAS), the preference-based generic measures of HRQoL.METHODS: Using a representative dataset from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) from January 2010 to December 2012, EQ-5D questionnaire and EQ- VAS scores of subjects with HI were compared with those of subjects without HI. Logistic regression analysis, with adjustment for covariates, was used to evaluate the impact of HI on HRQoL scales. HI was defined according to the hearing thresholds of pure-tone averages at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz of the better hearing ear as follows; mild HI (26 to &lt; 40 dB) and moderate to severe HI (= 40 dB).RESULTS: Of the 16,449 Korean adults in KNHANES (age, 45.0 ± 0.2 years; male, 49.7%), 1757 (weighted prevalence, 7.6%) had mild HI and 890 (3.6%) had moderate to severe HI. Subjects with HI had impaired HRQoL as compared with subjects without HI (EQ-5D, 0.96 ± 0.00 vs. 0.88±0.00 vs. 0.86 ± 0.01 for control vs. mild HI vs. moderate to severe HI, p &lt; 0.001; EQ-VAS, 75.10 ± 0.18 vs. 67.48 ± 0.63 vs. 66.24 ± 0.92 for control vs. mild HI vs. moderate to severe HI, p &lt; 0.001). After adjusting for socio-demographic factors (age, gender, household income, education level, presence of spouse) and health-related behaviors (smoking status, alcohol intake, regular exercise), psychological stress, and the presence of comorbidities (diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, decreased eGFR, and tinnitus), EQ-VAS remained impaired in the moderate to severe HI group (61.72±1.69) as compared with the control group (65.68 ± 1.26, p = 0.004), but EQ-5D impairment disappeared (0.86 ± 0.02 vs.0.88±0.01 for moderate to severe HI vs. control, p = 0.058).CONCLUSION: After adjusting for socio-demographic and psychosocial factors and comorbidities, Korean adults with moderate to severe HI rated their health statuses lower than subjects without HI."

This was used to select intervention functions and behaviour change techniques likely to influence behaviour in this context.The target behaviours were as follows: giving information about the benefits of hearing aid use and the negative consequences of non-use, providing prompts for use and engaging in collaborative behavioural planning for use. The behavioural analysis suggested that psychological capability, opportunity and motivation were potential drivers of these behaviours. The intervention functions of education, coercion, training, environmental restructuring, modelling and enablement were selected and combined to develop a single complex intervention that seeks to address the target behaviours.</AbstractText>: The target behaviours were as follows: giving information about the benefits of hearing aid use and the negative consequences of non-use, providing prompts for use and engaging in collaborative behavioural planning for use.

"27548284","Dimensions of Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing and Hearing Adolescents' Health Literacy and Health Knowledge.","Deaf and hard-of-hearing (D/HH) adults have lower health literacy compared to hearing adults, but it is unclear whether this disparity also occurs in adolescence. We used the Health Literacy Skills Instrument-Short Form (HLSI-SF), Short Form of the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA), Comprehensive Heart Disease Knowledge Questionnaire (CHDKQ), and newly constructed interactive and critical health literacy survey items to quantify D/HH and hearing adolescents' health literacy. We adapted and translated survey materials into sign language and spoken English to reduce testing bias due to variable English language skills. Participants were 187 D/HH and 94 hearing college-bound high school students. When we adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, school grade, and socioeconomic status, D/HH adolescents demonstrated weaker general and functional health literacy and cardiovascular health knowledge than hearing adolescents on the HLSI, S-TOFHLA, and CHDKQ (all ps &lt; .0001). Standard health literacy or knowledge scores were associated with several interactive and critical health literacy skills (all ps &lt; .05). D/HH adolescents who reported greater hearing-culture identity, having hearing aids, experiencing better hearing with assistive devices, having good quality of communication with parents, and attending hearing schools at least half of the time had higher functional health literacy (all ps &lt; .025). Those who reported English as their best language and attending hearing schools at least half of the time had higher cardiovascular health knowledge scores (all ps &lt; .03).

"27429594","How sociodemographic and hearing related factors were associated with use of hearing aid in a population-based study: The HUNT Study.","BACKGROUND: The purpose was to study hearing aid (HA) use in persons 65 years and older, and to investigate how socioeconomic and hearing related factors were associated to use of HA.METHOD: This study included 11,602 persons (65 years and above) from the second Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT2) and the integrated North-Trøndelag hearing loss study (NTHLS) in 1995-1997. Audiometry was taken of all participants. Missing information about use of HA in possible users of HA existed in data from 1103 (9.5 %) of the participants. Effects of sociodemographic variables, low, medium and high frequency hearing thresholds and being bothered by their hearing were explored in men and women, adjusting the effects for each other. Cross tabulations and logistic regression analyses were used.RESULTS: In all, 14 % (1472 of 10,499) were users of HA, but 62 % had a mean hearing impairment (HI) based on 0.5, 1, 2, 4 kHz over both ears &gt;25 dB. Use of HA was associated with higher education. Adjusting for all covariates and hearing variables, each 10 dB medium frequency threshold shift increased the chance of HA-use by a factor of two-three in both men and women. Having reported being bothered by hearing loss additionally increased the chance around sevenfold. Low frequency hearing thresholds were not associated with HA-use in women. In men, low frequency hearing thresholds up to 50 dB increased odds for use of HA, but low frequency hearing thresholds<U+2009>=<U+2009>70 dB decreased odds for use of HA. Men living with a spouse had higher odds for using HA compared to men without a spouse. For women there is no difference between those with and without spouse in use of HA. Men and women without spouse did not differ in their use of HA.CONCLUSIONS: About two third of 65 years and older participants had a HI higher than 25 dB, but only one seventh used HA. Use of HA was associated with higher than basic education. Men without a spouse were less likely to use HA compared to men with a spouse."
"27406663","Effects of Hearing Loss on Dual-Task Performance in an Audiovisual Virtual Reality Simulation of Listening While Walking.","BACKGROUND: Most activities of daily living require the dynamic integration of sights, sounds, and movements as people navigate complex environments. Nevertheless, little is known about the effects of hearing loss (HL) or hearing aid (HA) use on listening during multitasking challenges.PURPOSE: The objective of the current study was to investigate the effect of age-related hearing loss (ARHL) on word recognition accuracy in a dual-task experiment. Virtual reality (VR) technologies in a specialized laboratory (Challenging Environment Assessment Laboratory) were used to produce a controlled and safe simulated environment for listening while walking.RESEARCH DESIGN: In a simulation of a downtown street intersection, participants completed two single-task conditions, listening-only (standing stationary) and walking-only (walking on a treadmill to cross the simulated intersection with no speech presented), and a dual-task condition (listening while walking). For the listening task, they were required to recognize words spoken by a target talker when there was a competing talker. For some blocks of trials, the target talker was always located at 0° azimuth (100% probability condition); for other blocks, the target talker was more likely (60% of trials) to be located at the center (0° azimuth) and less likely (40% of trials) to be located at the left (270° azimuth).STUDY SAMPLE: The participants were eight older adults with bilateral HL (mean age = 73.3 yr, standard deviation [SD] = 8.4; three males) who wore their own HAs during testing and eight controls with normal hearing (NH) thresholds (mean age = 69.9 yr, SD = 5.4; two males). No participant had clinically significant visual, cognitive, or mobility impairments.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Word recognition accuracy and kinematic parameters (head and trunk angles, step width and length, stride time, cadence) were analyzed using mixed factorial analysis of variances with group as a between-subjects factor. Task condition (single versus dual) and probability (100% versus 60%) were within-subject factors. In analyses of the 60% listening condition, spatial expectation (likely versus unlikely) was a within-subject factor. Differences between groups in age and baseline measures of hearing, mobility, and cognition were tested using t tests.RESULTS: The NH group had significantly better word recognition accuracy than the HL group. Both groups performed better when the probability was higher and the target location more likely. For word recognition, dual-task costs for the HL group did not depend on condition, whereas the NH group demonstrated a surprising dual-task benefit in conditions with lower probability or spatial expectation. For the kinematic parameters, both groups demonstrated a more upright and less variable head position and more variable trunk position during dual-task conditions compared to the walking-only condition, suggesting that safe walking was prioritized. The HL group demonstrated more overall stride time variability than the NH group.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new knowledge about the effects of ARHL, HA use, and aging on word recognition when individuals also perform a mobility-related task that is typically experienced in everyday life. This research may help inform the development of more effective function-based approaches to assessment and intervention for people who are hard-of-hearing."

However, concerns have been raised regarding its systemic absorption and effect on developing tissues including brain. This study compared neurodevelopment at 18 months' corrected age in preterm infants of &lt;29 weeks' gestation treated with bevacizumab versus laser ablation.METHODS: Data from the Canadian Neonatal Network and the Canadian Neonatal Follow-Up Network databases were retrospectively reviewed. Infants born at &lt;29 weeks' in 2010-2011 with treated ROP were studied. Neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 months was assessed by using neurologic examination and the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition. Regression analyses were performed.RESULTS: Of 125 treated infants, 27 received bevacizumab and 98 laser. The bevacizumab group, compared with laser, obtained a median Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition motor composite score of 81 (interquartile range, 70-91) versus 88 (79-97), a language composite score of 79 (65-97) versus 89 (74-97), and a cognitive score of 90 (80-100) versus 90 (85-100). Difference was detected on the motor score only (P = .02). Odds of severe neurodevelopmental disabilities (Bayley scores &lt;70, severe cerebral palsy, hearing aids, or bilateral blindness) was 3.1 times higher (95% confidence interval: 1.2-8.4) in infants treated with bevacizumab versus laser after adjusting for gestational age, gender, maternal education, Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology-II score, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, sepsis, and severe brain injury.CONCLUSIONS: Preterm infants treated with bevacizumab versus laser had higher odds of severe neurodevelopmental disabilities.

Subjects underwent cognitive assessment using the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive and depressive symptoms evaluation using the Geriatric Depression Scale. The assessment of speech perception in noise (S/N ratio) was performed in free field using the Portuguese Sentence List test. Statistical analysis included the Spearman correlation calculation and multiple linear regression model, with 95% confidence level and 0.05 significance level.RESULTS: In the study of speech perception in noise (S/N ratio), there was statistically significant correlation between education scores (p=0.018), as well as with the Mini-Mental State Examination (p=0.002), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive (p=0.003), and Geriatric Depression Scale (p=0.022) scores. We found that for a one-unit increase in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive score, the S/N ratio increased on average 0.15dB, and for an increase of one year in education, the S/N ratio decreased on average 0.40dB.CONCLUSION: Level of education, cognitive performance, and depressive symptoms influence the speech perception in noise of elderly hearing aids users. The better the cognitive level and the higher the education, the better is the elderly communicative performance in noise."

We examined the association between hearing impairment and risk of incident disability and all-cause mortality.DESIGN AND SETTING: prospective cohort of community-dwelling older men aged 63-85 followed up for disability over 2 years and for all-cause mortality for 10 years in the British Regional Heart Study.METHODS: data were collected on self-reported hearing impairment including hearing aid use, and disability assessed as mobility limitations (problems walking/taking stairs), difficulties with activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL). Mortality data were obtained from the National Health Service register.RESULTS: among 3,981 men, 1,074 (27%) reported hearing impairment. Compared with men with no hearing impairment, men who could hear and used a hearing aid, and men who could not hear despite a hearing aid had increased risks of IADL difficulties (age-adjusted OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.29-2.70; OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.53-4.93, respectively). The associations remained after further adjustment for covariates including social class, lifestyle factors, co-morbidities and social engagement. Associations of hearing impairment with incident mobility limitations, incident ADL difficulties and all-cause mortality were attenuated on adjustment for covariates.CONCLUSION: this study suggests that hearing problems in later life could increase the risk of having difficulties performing IADLs, which include more complex everyday tasks such as shopping and light housework. However, further studies are needed to determine the associations observed including the underlying pathways."

The study was designed retrospectively, and those patients who have been using hearing aid for at least 6 months were invited for evaluation. Demographical data, hearing aid type (digital vs analog), general satisfaction, and daily usage time were asked. Then, the Hearing Aid Satisfaction Questionnaire (HASQ) was applied to all patients which included visual analog scale (VAS)-based 10 questions about the effects of hearing aid on social communication, efficiency, cosmetics, life quality and cost. Totally 400 patients were included in the study. The HASQ was confirmed to be highly reliable by &quot;Kaiser Meyer Olkin and Bartlett Sphericity&quot; tests after exclusion of aid-cost question. There was a negative correlation between age and satisfaction, and a positive correlation between hearing aid usage time (years) and satisfaction (p &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference between mean HASQ scores regarding gender, employment status, hearing aid type and the site of hearing aid wearing. HASQ scores were significantly worse in pure sensorineural loss type, lower educational status, shorter daily usage time, but better in higher pure tone threshold levels (p &lt; 0.05). Age, time of hearing aid usage daily, type of hearing impairment, the threshold of hearing and education were the factors affecting satisfaction. Regular daily usage of hearing aid should be encouraged in patients, since by this way aid usage and satisfaction may be improved."

This study explores how dietary fat intake in high-risk midlife adults living in the rural south is influenced by three behavior settings, i.e. in the home, at work, and at church.METHODS: Self-report data were collected from rural African American or Caucasian adults age 40-70 at three time points at baseline, 6, and 12 months post baseline. Multilevel analyses investigated the impact of determinants of fat intake over time.RESULTS: Home and work environments varied significantly over time in regard to healthy eating while church environments remained stable. Age, gender, and self-efficacy for healthy eating were individual factors associated with fat intake. In the home, presence of more high fat items, a time-varying variable, was significant. In the work environment, having access to healthy foods as well as healthy eating programs has positive impact as did hearing healthy eating messages and availability of healthy foods at church.CONCLUSIONS: Understanding stability and variability of dietary fat intake from a social ecologic perspective will aid in identifying targets of change for intervention. Understanding which components of key behavior settings are dynamic and which are relatively stable will help to disentangle the complexity of multi-level determinants of dietary behavior."

The objectives of this study are to determine the prevalence of UHL in U.S. adults and its treatment with hearing aids using a nationally representative study.STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional national epidemiologic study (n = 6,242).METHODS: Subjects = 18 years old with audiometric testing in the 2005 to 2006, 2009 to 2010, and 2011 to 2012 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study were included. UHL was defined as normal hearing (=25 decibels hearing level [dB HL] pure tone average [PTA]) in one ear and at least mild hearing loss (&gt;25 dB HL PTA) in the other ear. Hearing aid usage was defined by at least 5 hours per week (2005-2006) or at least seldom (2009-2012) use. Sampling weights were utilized to ensure generalizability to the U.S.RESULTS: The overall prevalence of UHL in adult Americans was 7.2% (95% confidence interval 6.1%-8.6%), with 5.7% (4.8%-6.7%) having mild and 1.5% (0.1%-2.1%) with moderate-or-worse UHL; nearly one-third of the latter reported trouble hearing. The prevalence of hearing aid usage in those with UHL was 2.0% (0.6%-6.7%). Of those with mild UHL, 1.4% (0.2%-8.0%) used hearing aids. Of those with moderate UHL, 4.2% (0.1%-22%) used hearing aids. Among those with UHL and also at least moderate subjective difficulty hearing, only 11% wore hearing aids.CONCLUSION: UHL is common among U.S. adults. Hearing aid usage is very low, even when there is perceived handicap. Public health education is needed to increase awareness of and auditory rehabilitation for UHL.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2.

"29187416","Improving hearing and vision in dementia: protocol for a field trial of a new intervention.","INTRODUCTION: Quality of life and other key outcomes may be improved by optimising hearing and vision function in people living with dementia. To date, there is limited research assessing the efficacy of interventions aimed at improving hearing and vision in people with dementia. Here, we outline a protocol to field test a newly developed home-based intervention, designed to optimise sensory functioning in people with dementia in three European sites. The results of this study will inform the design and conduct of a full-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) in five European sites.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this multisite, single arm, open label, feasibility study, participants with dementia (n=24) will be assessed for hearing and vision impairments and be prescribed a hearing aid and/or glasses. Each participant will have a study partner ('dyads'). A subset of dyads will receive 'sensory support' from a 'sensory support therapist', comprising home visits over 12 weeks. The therapist will offer the following intervention: adherence support for corrective devices; adaptations to the home environment to facilitate sensory function; communication training; and referral to community-based support services. The primary outcomes will be process measures assessing the feasibility, tolerability and acceptability of: (1) the intervention components; (2) the method of implementation of the intervention and (3) the study procedures, including outcome assessment measures. Quantitative data will be collected at baseline and follow-up. Qualitative data using semistructured interviews will be collected postintervention and weekly, using participant diaries. Finally, we will explore a model of cost-effectiveness to apply in the subsequent full-scale trial. This feasibility study is a necessary step in the development of a complex, individualised, psychosocial intervention. The data gathered will allow logistical and theoretical processes to be refined in preparation for a full-scale RCT.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained in all three participating countries. Results of the field trial will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal."

The effects, however, have never been examined using randomized controlled designs. To investigate the effects of education on anxiety and pain for patients undergoing spinal surgery, a randomized trial with block design was used. Patients were recruited from a medical center in central Taiwan. We invited 90 patients to participate in this study. Inclusion criteria were (a) age =20 years, (b) voluntary participation, (c) able to understand Taiwanese Mandarin Chinese or Taiwanese, and (4) no hearing or vision impairments after using aids. Patients (n = 86) undergoing lumbar spinal surgery were randomized into either an Intervention group (using educational intervention; n = 43) or a Control group (n = 43); four patients voluntarily dropped out after surgery (one in Intervention group; three in Control group). Patients had their anxiety (using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; STAI) and pain (using a visual analog scale) measured the day before surgery, 30 minutes before surgery, and the day after surgery. After controlling for demographics, the adjusted anxiety and pain levels were significantly lower for the Intervention group: mean STAI scores were 52.67 at baseline and 47.54 at 30 minutes before surgery (p &lt; .001); mean pain scores were 6.07 at baseline and 5.28 on day after surgery (p &lt; .001).

"29096117","Exploring an educational assessment tool to measure registered nurses' knowledge of hearing impairment and effective communication strategies: A USA study.","Poor communication between the Registered Nurse and a hearing impaired patient can affect quality of care and health outcomes. Communication skills training programs for healthcare providers are needed to improve patient centered care. A descriptive research study, using a knowledge assessment tool developed and validated by the researcher, was conducted on 339 Registered Nurses to identify knowledge deficits to be addressed in a communication skills training program being designed. The educational tool measured the Registered Nurses' knowledge across four areas - hearing impairment, hearing aids, communication strategies, and regulations regarding access to care for a person with a hearing disability. Knowledge deficits were detected in all four areas. Using this educational assessment tool may enable nurse educators to tailor communication skills training programs to specifically address the gaps identified regarding hearing impairment and how to effectively communicate with the hearing impaired patient. Post training program, nurse educators can use the tool to evaluate effectiveness."
"28830503","An economic evaluation of the healthcare cost of tinnitus management in the UK.","BACKGROUND: There is no standard treatment pathway for tinnitus patients in the UK. Possible therapies include education and reassurance, cognitive behavioural therapies, modified tinnitus retraining therapy (education and sound enrichment), or amplification of external sound using hearing aids. However, the effectiveness of most therapies is somewhat controversial. As health services come under economic pressure to deploy resources more effectively there is an increasing need to demonstrate the value of tinnitus therapies, and how value may be continuously enhanced. The objective of this project was to map out existing clinical practice, estimate the NHS costs associated with the management approaches used, and obtain initial indicative estimates of cost-effectiveness.METHODS: Current treatment pathways, costs and health outcomes were determined from the tinnitus literature, national statistics, a patient survey, and expert opinion. These were used to create an Excel-based economic model of therapy options for tinnitus patients. The probabilities associated with the likelihood of an individual patient receiving a particular combination of therapies was used to calculate the average cost of treatment per patient, average health outcome per patient measured in QALYs gained, and cost-effectiveness, measured by the average cost per QALY gained.RESULTS: The average cost of tinnitus treatment per patient per year is GB£717, equating to an NHS healthcare bill of GB£750 million per year. Across all pathways, tinnitus therapy costs £10,600 per QALY gained. Results were relatively insensitive to restrictions on access to cognitive behaviour therapy, and a subsequent reliance on other therapies.CONCLUSIONS: NHS provisions for tinnitus are cost-effective against the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence cost-effective threshold. Most interventions help, but education alone offers very small QALY gains. The most cost-effective therapies in the model were delivered within audiology."
"28792529","Discrepancy between self-assessed hearing status and measured audiometric evaluation.","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the difference between self-reported hearing status and hearing impairment assessed using conventional audiometry. The associated factors were examined when a concordance between self-reported hearing and audiometric measures was lacking.METHODS: In total, 19,642 individuals =20 years of age who participated in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys conducted from 2009 through 2012 were enrolled. Pure-tone hearing threshold audiometry (PTA) was measured and classified into three levels: &lt;25 dB (normal hearing); =25 dB &lt;40 dB (mild hearing impairment); and =40 dB (moderate-to-severe hearing impairment). The self-reported hearing loss was categorized into 3 categories. The participants were categorized into three groups: the concordance (matched between self-reported hearing loss and audiometric PTA), overestimation (higher self-reported hearing loss compared to audiometric PTA), and underestimation groups (lower self-reported hearing loss compared to audiometric PTA). The associations of age, sex, education level, stress level, anxiety/depression, tympanic membrane (TM) status, hearing aid use, and tinnitus with the discrepancy between the hearing self-reported hearing loss and audiometric pure tone threshold results were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression analysis with complex sampling.RESULTS: Overall, 80.1%, 7.1%, and 12.8% of the participants were assigned to the concordance, overestimation, and underestimation groups, respectively. Older age (adjusted odds ratios [AORs] = 1.28 [95% confidence interval = 1.19-1.37] and 2.80 [2.62-2.99] for the overestimation and the underestimation groups, respectively), abnormal TM (2.17 [1.46-3.23] and 1.59 [1.17-2.15]), and tinnitus (2.44 [2.10-2.83] and 1.61 [1.38-1.87]) were positively correlated with both the overestimation and underestimation groups. Compared with specialized workers, service workers, manual workers, and the unemployed were more likely to be in the overestimation group (1.48 [1.11-1.98], 1.39 [1.04-1.86], and 1.50 [1.18-1.90], respectively), and service workers were more likely to be in the underestimation group (AOR = 1.42 [1.01-1.99]). Higher education level (0.77 [0.59-1.01] and 0.43 [0.33-0.57]) and hearing aid use (0.36 [0.17-0.77] and 0.23 [0.13-0.43]) were negatively associated with being in the underestimation group (0.43 [0.37-0.50]). Compared with males, females were less likely to be assigned to the underestimation group (0.43 [0.37-0.50]). Stress (1.98 [1.32-2.98]) and anxiety/depression (1.30 [1.06-1.59]) were associated with overestimation group.CONCLUSION: Older age, lower education level, occupation, abnormal TM, non-hearing aid use, and tinnitus were related to both overestimation and underestimation groups. Male gender was related to underestimation, and stress and anxiety/depression were correlated with overestimation group. An understanding of these factors associated with the self-reported hearing loss will be instrumental to identifying and managing hearing-impaired individuals."

"28687058","The Participation Scale: psychometric properties of a South Indian translation with hearing-impaired respondents.","AIMS: The Participation Scale (P-Scale) is a widely used generic self-report measure designed to assess an individual's participation restriction consequent to any disease condition. The present study aimed to evaluate the validity and reliability of a south Indian (Kannada language) version of the P-Scale for use with adults with hearing loss. This study is a part of an ongoing research program on the assessment of outcomes of hearing health rehabilitation with hearing aids involving Indian client groups.METHODS: One hundred and three adults with hearing loss completed the original English and the newly translated-adapted Kannada P-Scale questionnaire. Nearly half of the participants completed repeat testing of the Kannada version 15<U+2009>days after the initial assessment. Along with the P-Scale, Kannada versions of the Hearing Handicap Questionnaire (HHQ) and the Assessment of Quality of Life - 4 Dimensions Questionnaire (AQoL-4D) were also administered. Based on predefined quality criteria, five different psychometric properties of the P-Scale were evaluated, together with an analysis of the Kannada P-Scale's factor structure. The psychometric properties assessed included internal consistency, test-retest reliability, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and floor-ceiling effects.RESULTS: Principal component analysis indicated a four-factor complex structure, which explained 69.78% of the variance in the Kannada P-Scale. High internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.90) and test-retest reliability (internal consistency coefficient <U+2009>&gt;0.90) were obtained. Comparisons with the HHQ (<U+03C1><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.52) and AQoL-4<U+2009>D (<U+03C1><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.76) indicated good convergent validity. Discriminant validity among the P-Scale questions was acceptable (inter-item correlation <U+2009>&lt;0.60). Floor and ceiling effects were not evident in the Kannada P-Scale.CONCLUSIONS: The psychometric characteristics of the Kannada P-scale were found to be sufficient for use with the participant group (literate, Kannada-speaking adults with hearing loss) who were assessed in this study. Further research is required to determine generalizability of the Kannada P-Scale among other Kannada-speaking communities. Implications for Rehabilitation The Kannada version of the Participation Scale (P-Scale) can be validly used with Kannada speaking adults with hearing loss. The Kannada P-Scale can be used for clinical/research purposes to assess outcome (specifically, change in participation restriction) before, during, and after the hearing rehabilitation process. However, education and socioeconomic status may have an effect of the Kannada P-Scale results and these factors need to be further investigated prior to wider clinical use."

"28634259","Effectiveness of an online SUpport PRogramme (SUPR) for older hearing aid users: study protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: An educational SUpport PRogramme called SUPR has been developed for hearing aid users (HAUs) and their communication partners (CPs) offering care beyond hearing aid fitting. SUPR teaches its users communication strategies, hearing aid handling skills and personal adjustment to hearing impairment.DESIGN: Using a cluster randomised controlled trial design, 70 Dutch hearing aid dispenser practices were randomised into hearing aid fitting (care as usual, 34 practices) and hearing aid fitting including SUPR (36 practices). The aim was to recruit a total of 569 older (aged 50+ years) first-time (n=258) and experienced (n=311) HAUs and their CPs. SUPR consists of a Practical Support Booklet and online material offered via email over a period of 6-7 months. The booklet provides practical information on hearing aids, advice on communication strategies and home exercises. The online material consists of educational videos on hearing aid functionality and usage, communication strategies and peer testimonials. Finally, noncommittal email contact with the dispenser is offered. Every HAU is asked to assign a CP who is advised to be involved intensively. Effect measurements for HAUs and their CPs will occur at baseline and at 6, 12 and 18<U+2009>months follow-up via online questionnaires. The primary outcomes for HAUs will be the use of communication strategies as measured by the subscales of the Communication Profile for the Hearing Impaired. A process evaluation will be performed.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Dutch Institutional Review Board of the VU Medical University Center Amsterdam. This intervention could contribute to lowering the hearing impairment burden in our ageing society. The results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and scientific conferences.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN77340339; Pre-results."
"28590895","A Qualitative Case Study of Smartphone-Connected Hearing Aids: Influences on Patients, Clinicians, and Patient-Clinician Interactions.","BACKGROUND: Innovations in hearing aid technology influence clinicians and individuals who use hearing aids. Little research, to date, explains the innovation adoption experiences and perspectives of clinicians and patients, which matter to a field like audiology, wherein technology innovation is constant. By understanding clinician and patient experiences with such innovations, the field of audiology may develop technologies and ways of practicing in a manner more responsive to patients' needs, and attentive to society's influence.PURPOSE: The authors aimed to understand how new innovations influence clinician and patient experiences, through a study focusing on connected hearing aids. &quot;Connected&quot; refers to the wireless functional connection of hearing aids with everyday technologies like mobile phones and tablets.RESEARCH DESIGN: The authors used a qualitative collective case study methodology, borrowing from constructivist grounded theory for data collection and analysis methods. Specifically, the authors designed a collective case study of a connected hearing aid and smartphone application, composed of two cases of experience with the innovation: the case of clinician experiences, and the case of patient experiences.STUDY SAMPLE: The qualitative sampling methods employed were case sampling, purposive within-case sampling, and theoretical sampling, and culminated in a total collective case n = 19 (clinician case n = 8; patient case n = 11). These data were triangulated with a supplementary sample of ten documents: relevant news and popular media collected during the study time frame.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The authors conducted interviews with the patients and clinicians, and analyzed the interview and document data using the constant comparative method. The authors compared their two cases by looking at trends within, between, and across cases.RESULTS: The clinician case highlighted clinicians' heuristic-based candidacy judgments in response to the adoption of the connected hearing aids into their practice. The patient case revealed patients' perceptions of themselves as technologically competent or incompetent, and descriptions of how they learned to use the new technology. Between cases, the study found a difference in the response to how the connected hearing aid changed the clinician-patient relationship. While clinicians valued the increased time they spent &quot;getting to know&quot; their patients, patients experienced some frustration specific to the additional troubleshooting related to Bluetooth connectivity. Across cases, there was a resounding theme of &quot;normalization&quot; of hearing aids via their integration with a &quot;normal&quot; technology (mobile phones) and general lack of concern about privacy in relation to the smartphone application and its tracking and geotagging features. Both audiologists and patients credited the connected hearing aids with increased opportunities to participate more fully in everyday life.CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of smartphone-connected hearing aids influenced the identities and candidate profiles of hearing aid users, and the nature of time spent in clinical interactions, in important and interesting ways. The influence of connected hearing aids on patient experience and audiology practice calls for continued research and clinical consideration, with implications for clinical decision-making regarding hearing aid candidacy. Further study should look critically at normalization and possible unintended stigmatizing effects of making hearing aids increasingly discreet."

Beneficiaries were categorized into 1 of 4 outcome categories: stable or improved function, functional deterioration, institutionalization, or death.RESULTS: Our model identified 16 factors for functional deterioration (age, gender, education, living arrangement, dual eligibility, proxy use, Alzheimer disease/dementia, angina pectoris/coronary heart disease, diabetes, emphysema/asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, mental/psychiatric disorder, Parkinson disease, stroke/brain hemorrhage, hearing impairment, vision impairment, and baseline ADL stage) after backward selection (P &lt; .05). Compared to stable or improved function, the risk of functional deterioration ranged from =1 to =6, =4 to =22 for the risk of institutionalization, and =3 to =16 for the risk of death.CONCLUSION: Predictive indices, or point and scoring systems used to predict outcomes, can identify elderly Medicare beneficiaries at risk for functional deterioration, institutionalization, and death and can aid policy makers, clinicians, and family members in improving care for older adults and supporting successful aging in the community.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III."
"28439694","Modifications to a 3D-printed temporal bone model for augmented stapes fixation surgery teaching.","Functional outcomes and complications in otosclerosis surgery are governed by the surgeon's experience. Thus, teaching the procedure to residents to guide them through the learning process as quickly as possible is challenging. Artificial 3D-printed temporal bones are replacing cadaver specimens in many institutions to learn mastoidectomy, but these are not suitable for middle ear surgery training. The goal of this work was to adapt such an artificial temporal bone to aid the teaching of otosclerosis surgery and to evaluate this tool. We have modified a commercially available 3D-printed temporal bone by replacing the incus and stapes of the model with in-house 3D-printed ossicles. The incus could be attached to a 6-axis force sensor. The stapes footplate was fenestrated and attached to a 1-axis force sensor. Six junior surgeons (residents) and seven senior surgeons (fellows or consultants) were enrolled to perform piston prosthesis placement and crimping as performed during otosclerosis surgery. The time required to perform the tasks and the forces applied to the incus and stapes were collected and analyzed. No statistically significant differences were observed between the junior and senior groups for time taken to perform the tasks and the forces applied to the incus during crimping and placement of the prosthesis. However, significantly lower forces were applied to the stapes by the senior surgeons in comparison with the junior surgeons during prosthesis placement (junior vs senior group, 328 ± 202.9 vs 80 ± 99.6 mN, p = 0.008) and during prosthesis crimping (junior vs senior group, 565 ± 233 vs 66 ± 48.6 mN, p = 0.02). We have described a new teaching tool for otosclerosis surgery based on the modification of a 3D-printed temporal bone to implement force sensors on the incus and stapes. This tool could be used as a training tool to help the residents to self-evaluate their progress with recording of objective measurements."

"28277215","Audiological Rehabilitation for Facilitating Hearing Aid Use: A Review.","PURPOSE: This article reviews and critically analyzes the design of studies on the effect of audiological rehabilitation (AR) programs on hearing aid (HA) outcomes, in order to guide future research.RESEARCH DESIGN: The design of this study was a narrative review. Studies were included in the review if they were randomized controlled trials that investigated the effects of AR on HA use and outcome between 2000 and 2016.RESULTS: Seven articles that met the inclusion criteria were included in the review. Most used educational rather than counseling approaches. Although educational AR programs seem to be useful in enhancing the use of communication strategies, there is limited evidence for their effect on HA use and self-perceived hearing handicap.CONCLUSIONS: More research is needed in this field. Future studies should (1) investigate the efficacy of AR interventions based on counseling and empathetic listening as opposed to or in addition to educational interventions, (2) use stricter criteria to include only a subpopulation of patients who do not get on well with their HAs, (3) measure the amount of HA use via data-logging and self-report questionnaires, and (4) use a matching comparison intervention for patients in the control group."

"28120586","Iranian Version of Speech, Spatial, and Qualities of Hearing Scale: A Psychometric Study.","Evaluation of communication abilities in the elderly is crucial for activities which will be performed to improve their quality of life. A valid and reliable questionnaire is needed for assessing communication abilities. We aimed to translate and validate the speech, spatial, and qualities of hearing scale (SSQ) in Iran. The forward-backward procedure was applied to translate the questionnaire from English into Persian. After linguistic validation and pilot study, a cross-sectional study was carried out, and psychometric properties of the Iranian version of the SSQ were tested. Number of 333 elderly individuals with impaired hearing completed the questionnaire. Number 48.3% were hearing aid users and 51.7% was not. Reliability was assessed by internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) and test-retest analysis. Exploratory factor analysis was performed for extracting factor structure of the Persian version of SSQ. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to compare different models of factor loadings. The Mean age of participants was 62.00 years (SD=9.58 years), and the mean SSQ score was 5.1 (SD=1.2, ranged: 3.17-6.27). Reliability evaluation revealed high internal consistency and good test- retest reliability. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.96 and the Pierson Correlation at test-retest analysis was 0.73 for Quality of hearing factor, 0.88 for Spatial and o.73 for Speech understanding factor. The results of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) indicated a four-factor solution for P-SSQ that jointly accounted for 52.40% of the variance observed. Confirmatory factor analysis approved the three factor solution but proposed a possible fourth factor. The Iranian version of the SSQ has acceptable psychometric properties, and it will be helpful for assessing different kinds of communication abilities in the Iranian elderly population."

"29794566","Effects of Amplification and Hearing Aid Experience on the Contribution of Specific Frequency Bands to Loudness.","OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study is to describe the effect of hearing aid amplification on the contribution of specific frequency bands to overall loudness in adult listeners with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Results for listeners with SNHL were compared with results for listeners with normal hearing (NH) to evaluate whether amplification restores the normal perception of loudness for broadband sound. A secondary aim of this study is to determine whether the loudness perception of new hearing aid users becomes closer to normal over the first few months of hearing aid use. It was hypothesized that amplification would cause the high-frequency bands to contribute most to the perception of loudness and that this effect might decrease as new hearing aid users adapt to amplification.DESIGN: In experiment 1, 8 adult listeners with SNHL completed a two-interval forced-choice loudness task in unaided and aided conditions. A control group of 7 listeners with NH completed the task in the unaided condition only. Stimuli were composed of seven summed noise bands whose levels were independently adjusted between presentations. During a trial, two stimuli were presented, and listeners determined the louder one. The correlation between the difference in levels for a given noise band on every trial and the listener's response was calculated. The resulting measure is termed the perceptual weight because it provides an estimate of the relative contribution of a given frequency region to overall loudness. In experiment 2, a separate group of 6 new hearing aid users repeated identical procedures on 2 sessions separated by 12 weeks.RESULTS: Results for listeners with SNHL were similar in experiments 1 and 2. In the unaided condition, perceptual weights were greatest for the low-frequency bands. In the aided condition, perceptual weights were greatest for the high-frequency bands. On average, the aided perceptual weights for listeners with SNHL for high-frequency bands were greater than the unaided weights for listeners with NH. In experiment 2, hearing aid experience did not have a significant effect on perceptual weights.CONCLUSIONS: The high frequencies seem to dominate loudness perception in listeners with SNHL using hearing aids as they do in listeners with NH. However, the results suggest that amplification causes high frequencies to have a larger contribution to overall loudness compared with listeners with NH. The contribution of the high frequencies to loudness did not change after an acclimatization period for the first-time hearing aid users."

"29708490","Audiology Assistants: Results of a Multicenter Survey.","BACKGROUND: Although audiologists have been using support personnel for over 45 yr, controversy and variability continue with respect to the entry-level education, training methods, and scope of practice.PURPOSE: As part of a larger clinical practices survey, this report focuses on use of audiology assistants (AAs) for pediatric settings and &quot;life-span&quot; facilities that had a significant population of pediatric patients.RESEARCH DESIGN: A questionnaire was sent to 116 facilities in geographically diverse locations. Of the 25 surveys returned, 22 had sufficient data to be included for analysis purposes.RESULTS: The majority of respondents assigned duties to AAs as follows: assisting with conditioned play audiometry and visual reinforcement audiometry, infection control, mail management, disposing of protected health information, ordering supplies, calling families, fielding family phone calls, and stocking supplies. In addition, of the nine pediatric facilities that used AAs and reported job duties, the majority assigned troubleshooting equipment and auditory brainstem response (ABR) screening. Two of the five life-span facilities that reported job duties assigned several duties not assigned by any of the pediatric facilities: pure-tone screening, earmold impressions, assisting with videonystagmography and ABR, and in-house hearing aid repairs. Of facilities that use AAs and reported staffing, the ratio of AAs to audiologists ranged from 0.03:1 to 1:0.37, with an average of 0.15 for life-span facilities and 0.17 for the pediatric facilities. Minimum educational levels required were reported as follows: high school (n = 8), college (n = 3), certificate (n = 1), and no requirement (n = 1).CONCLUSIONS: Within a small sample size of pediatric and life-span facilities, 14 of 22 centers used AAs to perform a variety of direct patient care, indirect patient care, and clerical duties. Based on the duties recommended within the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association guidelines and by many states, expanded employment of AAs, as well as expansion of assigned duties should be considered. Data are needed to determine the appropriate ratio of AAs to audiologists within different settings and to determine the impact of AAs for accessibility, productivity, and profitability."

However, 68.7% of the respondents said they cannot marry a person with SCD.CONCLUSION: The study results indicate that more effort needs to be done to promote sickle cell awareness in Uganda communities with emphasis on the inclusion of sickle cell in health education campaigns."
"29488873","Description, Normative Data, and Utility of the Hearing Aid Skills and Knowledge Test.","BACKGROUND: The ability to manage hearing aids is crucial for successful outcomes and for maintaining hearing aid use. It is therefore important to have a tool that can effectively identify which hearing aid management skills are lacking so that the audiologist can provide additional education and training on that skill. Such a tool can also provide useful quantitative data for researchers.PURPOSE: To collect normative data (Experiment 1) and assess inter- and intrarater reliability (Experiment 2) for a hearing aid management assessment tool known as the Hearing Aid Skills and Knowledge (HASK) test.STUDY SAMPLE: Two hundred thirty-six new hearing aid users recruited from the VA Portland Health Care System and 126 experienced hearing aid users recruited from the local Portland community participated in Experiment 1. The veteran participants were taking part in a larger hearing aid study, and the community participants were recruited at community events that took place around Portland, OR. Three clinical audiologists and two AuD students completing their fourth year externship participated in Experiment 2.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: In Experiment 1, HASK data were collected from the new hearing aid users at 4-8 wk and 6-8 mo after the fitting of their first pair of hearing aids, and from experienced users on a single occasion. In addition, self-reported hearing aid use, benefit, and satisfaction were assessed for all participants. The audiologists/students in Experiment 2 watched and independently scored videos of six individuals completing the HASK. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) across audiologists were computed for HASK scores. Three audiologists/students rated at least one video on two occasions to provide interrater reliability data.RESULTS: Mean performance on the HASK was about 70% for knowledge and 80% for skills for both the new and experienced hearing aid users. Performance did not change among the new users between the 4-8 wk and 6-8 mo administration. The specific skills lacking were associated with advanced management abilities (cleaning and troubleshooting). Experiment 2 revealed ICCs for inter- and intrarater reliability for HASK to range from 0.76 to 0.94, showing acceptable to excellent reliability.CONCLUSIONS: The HASK is a quick and easy test with good-to-excellent inter- and intrarater reliability. It can effectively identify which hearing aid management skills are lacking so that the audiologist can provide additional education and training on those skills. Data show performance is ~70% for knowledge and 80% for skills and this does not change with hearing aid experience. The significant positive correlations between HASK scores and hearing aid use and satisfaction highlight the notion that ability to manage hearing aids successfully is integral to good hearing aid outcome."
"29471613","Examination of Previously Published Data to Identify Patterns in the Social Representation of 'Hearing Aids' Across Countries.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Societal factors seem to exercise a strong influence on hearing aid uptake, use, and satisfaction. In particular, knowledge, perception, and attitude of people will have bearing towards their and others health behavior and decisions. The current study aimed at understanding the perception of hearing aids by adults belonging to the general population in different countries.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study employed a crosssectional design. A sample of 404 adults from India, Iran, Portugal, and the United Kingdom were recruited by relying on a convenience sampling. Previously published data was re-analyzed but it was applied for different approach. Free association task was used to collect the data. They were asked to provide up to five words or phrases that come to mind when thinking about &quot;hearing aids.&quot; The data was initially analyzed based on qualitative content analysis. This was followed by quantitative cluster analysis and chi square analysis.RESULTS: The content analysis suggested 39 main categories of responses related to hearing aids. The cluster analysis resulted in five main clusters, namely: 1) positive attitude, 2) external factors, 3) hearing aid use and satisfaction, 4) etiology, and 5) benefits and limitations of technology. A few demographic factors (i.e., education, occupation type, country) showed association with different clusters, although country of origin seemed to be associated with most clusters.CONCLUSIONS: The study provides us with unique insights into the perception of hearing aids by the general public, and additionally, the way demographic variables may influence these perceptions."
"29315179","Prevalence of Hearing Loss and Hearing Care Use Among Asian Americans: A Nationally Representative Sample.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of hearing loss and factors affecting hearing care use among Asian Americans, using the first nationally representative sample of Asian Americans.STUDY DESIGN: National cross-sectional survey.SETTING: Ambulatory examination centers.PATIENTS: Three thousand six hundred twelve adults (522 Asian American) aged 20 to 69 in the 2011 to 2012 National Health and Examination Survey with pure-tone audiometry.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S: Percentage with hearing loss, undertaking a hearing test before the study, and hearing aid use. Hearing loss was defined as better hearing ear speech frequency pure-tone average =25 dBHL. Analyses incorporated sampling weights to account for complex sampling design.RESULTS: The prevalence of hearing loss was 6.0% [95% CI 3.1-8.9%] among Asian Americans, comparable to White, Black, and Hispanic groups, and increased substantially with age (OR: 2.25 [95% CI: 1.6-3.2]). After adjusting for age and pure-tone average, Asian Americans with hearing loss were less likely to have received a hearing test compared with White (OR: 0.27 [95% CI: 0.20-0.36, p<U+200A>=<U+200A>&lt;0.001]) and Black groups (OR: 0.26 [95% CI: 0.16-0.38, p&lt;0.001]), less likely to use hearing aids compared with Whites (OR: 0.06 [95% CI: 0.01-0.64], p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.02), and less likely to self-report poor hearing compared with Whites (OR: 0.30 [95% CI: 0.10-0.90], p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.03). Among Asian Americans, using more non-English than English, being foreign-born, less education, being married, and not having insurance were associated with lower levels of receiving a hearing test.CONCLUSION: The nationally representative sample of Asian Americans with hearing data suggests that hearing loss prevalence is similar to other races/ethnicities. However, hearing aid adoption by Asian Americans tends to be less frequent."
