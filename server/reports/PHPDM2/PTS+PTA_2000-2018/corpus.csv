"12869924","Short-duration space flight and hearing loss.","OBJECTIVES: The study goal was to determine whether a single Space Shuttle mission can induce decrements in astronaut hearing. Study design We retrospectively compared audiogram information obtained from Space Shuttle astronauts at 10 days preflight, day of return (R + 0), 3 days after landing return (R + 3), and at a mean delayed postflight follow-up of 8 months.RESULTS: Temporary threshold shift (mean, 4.6 dB) was noted in R + 0 versus preflight conditions (P &lt; 0.01). Small permanent threshold shifts (mean, 0.83 dB) were found at R + 3 and postflight follow-up compared with preflight in the lower frequencies (500 to 2000 Hz), and corresponding pure tone average (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions and significance The data indicate that a single Shuttle flight can induce a substantial temporary threshold shift and a small but statistically significant permanent threshold shift, particularly in the frequencies involved in speech reception. Although single-mission effects are small, cumulative effects over several missions may ultimately produce clinically significant hearing loss."
"15457813","A longitudinal study of changes in evoked otoacoustic emissions and pure-tone thresholds as measured in a hearing conservation program.","Non-linear transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) at 74dB pSPL, distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) at 65/45dB SPL and pure-tone audiometry were used to detect noise-induced, inner car changes in a longitudinal study. Repeated-measures ANOVAs were made on the Noise (n=69) and Quiet (n=42) groups. The Noise group's hearing thresholds increased by 1.2 dB and DPOAE amplitude decreased by -0.9 dB. For both groups, TEOAE amplitude decreased by approximately -0.6 dB. Eight of 12 ears with permanent threshold shift (PTS) and 10 of 13 ears with temporary threshold shift (TTS) showed TEOAE decrements or low baseline TEOAE amplitudes. Fewer TTS and PTS ears also showed DPOAE decrements, and there was never a DPOAE decrement without a corresponding TEOAE decrement or low TEOAE baseline. Some TTS ears showed permanent emission decrements. Although otoacoustic emissions show promise in detecting noise-induced inner ear changes, it is premature to use them in hearing conservation programs."
"16377998","Estimating noise-induced permanent threshold shift from audiometric shape: the ISO-1999 model.","OBJECTIVE: To describe the relation between audiometric shape and noise-induced permanent threshold shift averaged across the speech frequencies (N5123).DESIGN: Using an international standard (ISO-1999), 270 audiograms were created, representing both sexes and a variety of ages, exposure levels, and percentiles. Bulge depth (BD) was defined as the difference between pure-tone average for 2, 3, and 4 kHz and PTA for 1 and 6 kHz.RESULTS: N5123 was well-predicted by quadratic functions of BD, which accounted for 72 to 95% of the variance in N5123.CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of N5123, based on BD, can be helpful in medical-legal diagnosis and allocation of hearing loss."
"15913155","Recreational noise exposure and its effects on the hearing of adolescents. Part II: development of hearing disorders.","Part II, continuation of a previous paper, describes the significant hearing threshold shift found during the third year of the long-term study, which continued to be present in the fourth year, in a number of adolescents classified as Subgroup 2, who showed a higher mean HTL in the middle and especially in the high frequency ranges than the rest of the studied adolescents, classified as Subgroup 1. In both subgroups, the subjects showed high participation in recreational activities; nevertheless, the adolescents in Subgroup 2 showed higher participation in some of them in the last year of the study. From the beginning of the study, the mean HTL of the adolescents in Subgroup 2 was higher than the mean HTL of the adolescents in Subgroup 1. The exposure to high sound levels during leisure activities can be a cause of permanent hearing damage among young people with 'tender ears'."
"19766602","Follow-up of latency and threshold shifts of auditory brainstem responses after single and interrupted acoustic trauma in guinea pig.","Thresholds of auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) are widely used to estimate the level of noise-induced hearing loss or the level of acquired resistance to acoustic trauma after repeated exposures, i.e., the &quot;toughening&quot; effect. Less is known about ABR latencies and their relation to threshold changes. Guinea pigs were exposed to a traumatic pure tone at 5 kHz, 120 dB SPL, as either single (2 h, 4 h) or repeated (1 h every 48 h, four times) sessions. Thresholds and latencies of ABRs were monitored up to 45 days following the acoustic trauma. We show that latencies are prolonged in the case of large temporary threshold shifts observed in the days following trauma. The latency shift decreases after several repeated exposures, then stabilizes, similar to thresholds, suggesting that the &quot;toughening&quot; effect also applies to latencies. Permanent latency shift is usually very small compared to the permanent threshold shift. This effect could produce a recovery in the ability to process auditory information through the precise timing of neuronal events. Our study indicates that when estimated at suprathreshold stimulation level (70 dB SPL), latency provides complementary information to the sole threshold."
"19597738","The effect of active sonar for the protection of moored and anchored warships on the human hearing.","This study wants to show the effects of active middle frequency sonar on a selected group of Italian Navy divers. Ten male divers with normal hearing were exposed to active sonar of the Italian Navy for more than 100 exposures, each of at least 1-h duration, in the course of 6 months. Before, at the end, and six months after the end of noise exposure, we performed pure-tone audiometry, Carhart test, Peyser test, thresholds of discomfort test (TDT), tympanometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), and auditory brainstem response (ABR). At the end of the noise exposure, the audiological tests showed a worsening of the mean air and bone audiometric thresholds at the 2,000 (1/10), 4,000 (7/10), and 8,000 Hz (6/10); a fail status of the TEOAE and DPOAE, which were previously present, in all the divers; temporary threshold shift, at the Peyser test, in 9/10 divers; discomfort for pulse tone presented at the TDT test, in all the divers; no post exposure significant differences at the Carhart and ABR tests, in any of the divers. Six months after the end of noise exposure, all the divers presented a complete recovery of their audio-vestibular functions. Our results show the temporary negative effects of repeated and lasting exposure to active sonar (Hull MF) on the divers; the last control demonstrate the absence of permanent noise-induced hearing loss in divers exposed to active sonar."
"20160390","Noise induced hearing loss risk assessment in truck drivers.","Hearing sense is one of the key elements which may have impact on the driver's task quality. This cross-sectional study investigates the hearing status of 500 truck drivers by pure tone audiometry (AC) in one of the cities in Fars province, Iran. Hearing threshold levels of the subjects were measured in frequencies of 500Hz-8000Hz. Screening and determination of permanent threshold shift (PTS) was the first aim of this study. Hence tests were done at least 16 hours after any exposure to noticeable sound. The effect of age as a confounding factor was considered using ISO equation and subtracted from whole hearing threshold. The threshold of 25 dB HL and above was considered abnormal but the calculation of hearing was also carried out using 0 dB HL as reference. Subjects were categorized into two groups on the basis of working experience and the hearing threshold of 25 dB was considered a boundary of normal hearing sense. The results of Pearson Chi-Square test showed that working experience as an independent variable has significant contributing effect on hearing thresholds of truck drivers in frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz (p greater than 0.05). Also, it was shown that currently nine and 12.6 % of truck drivers suffer from impaired hearing sense in left and right respectively (hearing threshold level greater than 25 dB) in mid frequencies (500, 1000, 2000 Hz) and 45% in high frequencies of both ears (4000 and 8000 Hz). The results indicated that hearing damage of professional drivers was expected to occur sooner at 4000 and 8000 Hz than lower frequencies. Finally it was deduced that the occupational conditions of truck drivers may have bilateral, symmetrical harmful effect on hearing threshold sense in all frequencies mainly in frequency of 4000 Hz, so health surveillance programs such as education and periodic medical examinations are emphasized for pre-diagnosing and prevention of any possible impairment and an urgent need to take up some interventions such as better maintenance of roads, automobile industry efforts to reduce the noise level emission of vehicles and reducing number of working hours per day of drivers are highlighted to improve the harmful working conditions of truck drivers."
"22122960","Increased vitamin plasma levels in Swedish military personnel treated with nutrients prior to automatic weapon training.","Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a significant clinical, social, and economic issue. The development of novel therapeutic agents to reduce NIHL will potentially benefit multiple very large noise-exposed populations. Oxidative stress has been identified as a significant contributor to noise-induced sensory cell death and NIHL, and several antioxidant strategies have now been suggested for potential translation to human subjects. One such strategy is a combination of beta-carotene, vitamins C and E, and magnesium, which has shown promise for protection against NIHL in rodent models, and is being evaluated in a series of international human clinical trials using temporary (military gunfire, audio player use) and permanent (stamping factory, military airbase) threshold shift models (NCT00808470). The noise exposures used in the recently completed Swedish military gunfire study described in this report did not, on average, result in measurable changes in auditory function using conventional pure-tone thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) amplitudes as metrics. However, analysis of the plasma samples confirmed significant elevations in the bloodstream 2 hours after oral consumption of active clinical supplies, indicating the dose is realistic. The plasma outcomes are encouraging, but clinical acceptance of any novel therapeutic critically depends on demonstration that the agent reduces noise-induced threshold shift in randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective human clinical trials. Although this noise insult did not induce hearing loss, the trial design and study protocol can be applied to other populations exposed to different noise insults."
"21246211","Hearing loss in divers: a 6-year prospective study.","Occupational diving is associated with hearing loss, but the cause is disputed. Our aim was to follow a cohort of divers through the first 6 years of their career in order to look for evidence of permanent threshold shift associated with diving activity, occupational noise exposure or acute injuries. Hearing was measured by pure tone audiometry in 67 participants at a basic course for working divers. Hearing thresholds were adjusted for age (ISO 7029). The subjects were examined and interviewed by an otologist. Additional medical and exposure data were recorded in questionnaires and personal logbooks. The procedure was repeated after 3 and 6 years. None of the subjects suffered inner ear barotrauma or inner ear decompression sickness during follow-up. Middle ear barotrauma was common. The prevalence of subjective hearing difficulties increased during follow-up, and there was a significant threshold shift at 4 kHz (mean 2.6 dB, 95% confidence interval 0.9-4.3 dB). Both subjective and objective hearing loss was associated with occupational noise exposure, but not with diving frequency or with a history of middle ear barotrauma. In the absence of manifest inner ear barotrauma or inner ear decompression sickness, noise seems to be the most important cause of long-term hearing loss in occupational divers. This study did not find evidence of long-term hearing loss caused by uneventful diving per se."
"23198571","[Audiometric findings of senior high school students belonging to a Kendo Club].","Between 1992 and 2010, we studied audiometric findings obtained from the annual hearing examination for senior high-school students who belonged to an active Kendo team. The subjects comprised 140 males and 88 females with ages between 15 and 18 years. The pure tone audiometry showed that 69 ears of 45 students (19.7%) had sensorineural hearing loss with the highest threshold shift at 2000 Hz, followed by 4000 Hz. Frequent audiometric patterns included a 2000 Hz-dip, a 4000 Hz-dip and a combined loss of 2000 and 4000 Hz. Some of these affected subjects had shown a completely normal audiogram at the previous examination. Moreover, small-dips with a depth less than 25 dB were found to be limited either at 2000 Hz or at 4000 Hz, suggesting early audiometric changes from a temporary or a permanent threshold shift caused by noise and/or head blows during Kendo practice. The incidence of such abnormal audiograms among this Kendo club members appears to be decreasing year by year owing to the annual check-ups over the 18-year study period, and student counseling regarding the possible adverse effect of Kendo on the inner ear function."
"22718110","Prevalence of permanent hearing threshold shift among workers of Indian iron and steel small and medium enterprises: a study.","Occupational noise exposure and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) have been recognized as a problem among workers in Indian industries. The major industries in India are based on manufacturing. There are appreciable numbers of casting and forging units spread across the country. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of permanent hearing threshold shift among the workers engaged in Indian iron and steel small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and compared with control group subjects. As a part of hearing protection intervention, audiometric tests were conducted at low (250-1000 Hz), medium (1500-3000 Hz), and high (4000-8000 Hz) frequencies. The occurrence of hearing loss was determined based on hearing threshold levels with a low fence of 25 dB. Comparisons were made for hearing threshold at different frequencies between the exposed and control groups using Student's t test. ANOVA was used for the comparison of hearing threshold dB at different frequencies among occupation and year of experience. A P value &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All data were presented as mean value (SD). Over 90% of workers engaged in various processes of casting and forging industry showed hearing loss in the noise-sensitive medium and higher frequencies. Occupation was significantly associated with NIHL, and hearing loss was particularly high among the workers of forging section. The analyses revealed a higher prevalence of significant hearing loss among the forging workers compared to the workers associated with other activities. The study shows alarming signals of NIHL, especially in forging workers. The occupational exposure to noise could be minimized by efficient control measures through engineering controls, administrative controls, and the use of personal protective devices. Applications of engineering and/or administrative controls are frequently not feasible in the developing countries for technical and financial reasons. A complete hearing conservation programme, including training, audiometry, job rotation, and the use of hearing protection devices, is the most feasible method for the protection of industrial workers from prevailing noise in workplace environments in the developing countries."
"22710537","Prevalence of noise induced hearing loss among traffic police personnel of Kathmandu Metropolitan City.","BACKGROUND: Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a major preventable occupational health hazard.OBJECTIVE: To measure permanent threshold shift in traffic police personnel due to noise exposure and to examine whether it was associated with duration of noise exposure, years of work and risk factors.METHODS: Cross sectional, descriptive study conducted at Dhulikhel hospital, Kathmandu University Hospital in 110 responding traffic police personnel. Detailed history and clinical examination of ear, impedence audiometry and pure tone audiometry was performed.RESULTS: Mean age group was 29.82 years; 82(74.5%) were males and 28 (25.5%) were females. Mean duration of service is 11.86 years. Twenty six (23.6%) had tinnitus and 39(35.5%) had blocked sensation in ear. Sixty five (59.1%) worked between 10- 19 years. Alcohol and smoking shows positive impact on NIHL (p value =0.00). Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval were 4.481 (1.925-10.432) and 6.578 (2.306- 18.764) respectively. Among 73(66.4%) noise induced hearing loss positive cases, bilateral involvement was seen in 45 (40.9%) and unilateral in 28(25.4 %) cases. Among unilateral cases most were left sided. Hearing threshold at 4 kHz increased according to age and duration of service.CONCLUSION: Traffic police personnel are in constant risk of noise induced hearing loss. Screening for hearing loss is recommended for people exposed to noise."
"24805896","Proposed comprehensive ototoxicity monitoring program for VA healthcare (COMP-VA).","Prevention and rehabilitation of hearing loss and tinnitus, the two most commonly awarded service-connected disabilities, are high priority initiatives in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). At least 4,000 Veterans, most with significant hearing loss, will receive cisplatin this year, with more than half sustaining permanent hearing shift and nearly 40% developing new tinnitus. With improved survivability following cancer treatment, Veterans treated with cisplatin are approached with the dual goals of effective treatment and preserved quality of life. This article describes COMP-VA, a comprehensive ototoxicity monitoring program developed for VA patients receiving cisplatin. The program includes an individualized pretreatment prediction model that identifies the likelihood of hearing shift given cisplatin dose and patient factors. It supports both manual and automated hearing testing with a newly developed portable audiometer capable of performing the recommended procedures on the chemotherapy unit during treatment. It also includes objective methods for identifying outer hair cell changes and predicting audiogram changes using distortion-product otoacoustic emissions. We describe this program of evidence-based ototoxicity monitoring protocols using a case example to give the reader an understanding of how this program would be applied, along with a plan for future work to accomplish the final stages of program development.

"26572701","Hearing loss and tinnitus in rock musicians: A Norwegian survey.","Our focus in this study was to assess hearing thresholds and the prevalence and characteristics of tinnitus in a large group of rock musicians based in Norway. A further objective was to assess related factors such as exposure, instrument category, and the preventive effect of hearing protection. The study was a cross-sectional survey of rock musicians selected at random from a defined cohort of musicians. A random control group was included for comparison. We recruited 111 active musicians from the Oslo region, and a control group of 40 nonmusicians from the student population at the University of Tromsÿ. The subjects were investigated using clinical examination, pure tone audiometry, tympanometry, and a questionnaire. We observed a hearing loss in 37.8% of the rock musicians. Significantly poorer hearing thresholds were seen at most pure-tone frequencies in musicians than controls, with the most pronounced threshold shift at 6 kHz. The use of hearing protection, in particular custom-fitted earplugs, has a preventive effect but a minority of rock musicians apply them consistently. The degree of musical performance exposure was inversely related to the degree of hearing loss in our sample. Bass and guitar players had higher hearing thresholds than vocalists. We observed a 20% prevalence of chronic tinnitus but none of the affected musicians had severe tinnitus symptomatology. There was no statistical association between permanent tinnitus and hearing loss in our sample. We observed an increased prevalence of hearing loss and tinnitus in our sample of Norwegian rock musicians but the causal relationship between musical exposure and hearing loss or tinnitus is ambiguous. We recommend the use of hearing protection in rock musicians. "
"25620313","Efficacy and safety of N-acetylcysteine in prevention of noise induced hearing loss: a randomized clinical trial.","Despite a robust hearing conservation program, military personnel continue to be at high risk for noise induced hearing loss (NIHL). For more than a decade, a number of laboratories have investigated the use of antioxidants as a safe and effective adjunct to hearing conservation programs. Of the antioxidants that have been investigated, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has consistently reduced permanent NIHL in the laboratory, but its clinical efficacy is still controversial. This study provides a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating the safety profile and the efficacy of NAC to prevent hearing loss in a military population after weapons training. Of the 566 total study subjects, 277 received NAC while 289 were given placebo. The null hypothesis for the rate of STS was not rejected based on the measured results. While no significant differences were found for the primary outcome, rate of threshold shifts, the right ear threshold shift rate difference did approach significance (p†=†0.0562). No significant difference was found in the second primary outcome, percentage of subjects experiencing an adverse event between placebo and NAC groups (26.7% and 27.4%, respectively, p†=†0.4465). Results for the secondary outcome, STS rate in the trigger hand ear, did show a significant difference (34.98% for placebo-treated, 27.14% for NAC-treated, p-value†=†0.0288). Additionally, post-hoc analysis showed significant differences in threshold shift rates when handedness was taken into account. While the secondary outcomes and post-hoc analysis suggest that NAC treatment is superior to the placebo, the present study design failed to confirm this. The lack of significant differences in overall hearing loss between the treatment and placebo groups may be due to a number of factors, including suboptimal dosing, premature post-exposure audiograms, or differences in risk between ears or subjects. Based on secondary outcomes and post hoc analyses however, further studies seem warranted and are needed to clarify dose response and the factors that may have played a role in the observed results.

"27349914","Prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex vs. auditory brainstem response for hearing assessment.","The high prevalence of noise-induced and age-related hearing loss in the general population has warranted the use of animal models to study the etiology of these pathologies. Quick and accurate auditory threshold determination is a prerequisite for experimental manipulations targeting hearing loss in animal models. The standard auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurement is fairly quick and translational across species, but is limited by the need for anesthesia and a lack of perceptual assessment. The goal of this study was to develop a new method of hearing assessment utilizing prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle reflex, a commonly used tool that measures detection thresholds in awake animals, and can be performed on multiple animals simultaneously. We found that in control mice PPI audiometric functions are similar to both ABR and traditional operant conditioning audiograms. The hearing thresholds assessed with PPI audiometry in sound exposed mice were also similar to those detected by ABR thresholds one day after exposure. However, three months after exposure PPI threshold shifts were still evident at and near the frequency of exposure whereas ABR thresholds recovered to the pre-exposed level. In contrast, PPI audiometry and ABR wave one amplitudes detected similar losses. PPI audiometry provides a high throughput automated behavioral screening tool of hearing in awake animals. Overall, PPI audiometry and ABR assessments of the auditory system are robust techniques with distinct advantages and limitations, which when combined, can provide ample information about the functionality of the auditory system."
"28716314","Safety and efficacy of ebselen for the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial.","BACKGROUND: Noise-induced hearing loss is a leading cause of occupational and recreational injury and disease, and a major determinant of age-related hearing loss. No therapeutic agent has been approved for the prevention or treatment of this disorder. In animal models, glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) activity is reduced after acute noise exposure. Ebselen, a novel GPx1 mimic, has been shown to reduce both temporary and permanent noise-induced hearing loss in preclinical studies. We assessed the safety and efficacy of ebselen for the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss in young adults in a phase 2 clinical trial.METHODS: In this single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial, healthy adults aged 18-31 years were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) at the University of Florida (Gainsville, FL, USA) to receive ebselen 200 mg, 400 mg, or 600 mg, or placebo orally twice daily for 4 days, beginning 2 days before a calibrated sound challenge (4 h of pre-recorded music delivered by insert earphones). Randomisation was done with an allocation sequence generated by an independent third party. The primary outcome was mean temporary threshold shift (TTS) at 4 kHz measured 15 min after the calibrated sound challenge by pure tone audiometry; a reduction of 50% in an ebselen dose group compared with the placebo group was judged to be clinically relevant. All participants who received the calibrated sound challenge and at least one dose of study drug were included in the efficacy analysis. All randomly assigned patients were included in the safety analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01444846.FINDINGS: Between Jan 11, 2013, and March 24, 2014, 83 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive ebselen 200 mg (n=22), 400 mg (n=20), or 600 mg (n=21), or placebo (n=20). Two participants in the 200 mg ebselen group were discontinued from the study before the calibrated sound challenge because they no longer met the inclusion criteria; these participants were excluded from the efficacy analysis. Mean TTS at 4 kHz was 1∑32 dB (SE 0∑91) in the 400 mg ebselen group compared with 4∑07 dB (0∑90) in the placebo group, representing a significant reduction of 68% (difference -2∑75 dB, 95% CI -4∑54 to -0∑97; p=0∑0025). Compared with placebo, TTS at 4 kHz was non-significantly reduced by 21% in the 200 mg ebselen group (3∑23 dB [SE 0∑91] vs 4∑07 dB [0∑90] in the placebo group; difference -0∑84 dB, 95% CI -2∑63 to 0∑94; p=0∑3542) and by 7% in the 600 mg ebselen group (3∑81 dB [0∑90] vs 4∑07 dB [0∑90] in the placebo group; difference -0∑27, 95% CI -2∑03 to 1∑50; p=0∑7659). Ebselen treatment was well tolerated across all doses and no significant differences were seen in any haematological, serum chemistry, or radiological assessments between the ebselen groups and the placebo group.INTERPRETATION: Treatment with ebselen was safe and effective at a dose of 400 mg twice daily in preventing a noise-induced TTS. These data lend support to a role of GPx1 activity in acute noise-induced hearing loss.FUNDING: Sound Pharmaceuticals."
