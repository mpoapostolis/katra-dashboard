"12176760","Noise exposure and hearing loss among student employees working in university entertainment venues.","OBJECTIVES: Most studies to date on sound levels in entertainment establishments have concentrated on exposure levels for the attending public, rather than employees who may be at greater risk of hearing loss. Of particular concern are young employees. The aim of this pilot study was to (i) estimate typical sound levels in different areas where amplified music was played, (ii) measure temporary threshold shift (TTS) and (iii) estimate the dependence of hearing threshold shifts on measured noise levels.METHODS: This study focused on students working part-time (up to 16 h/week) in music bars and discotheques in a university entertainment venue. All 28 staff were invited to participate in the study. Pre- and post-exposure audiometry was used to determine hearing threshold at both high and low frequencies. Personal dosemeters and static measurements were made to assess noise levels and frequency characteristics. A questionnaire was used to determine patterns of noise exposure and attitudes to noise levels and hearing loss.RESULTS: Of the 28 student employees working in the three areas, 14 (50%) agreed to take part in the study, giving 21 pre- and post-shift audiograms. The mean personal exposure levels for security staff were higher than those of bar staff, with both groups exceeding 90 dB(A). The maximum peak pressure reading for security staff was 124 dB. Although TTS values were moderate, they were found to be highly significant at both low and high frequencies and for both ears. Twenty-nine per cent of subjects showed permanent hearing loss of more than 30 dB at either low or high frequencies. The correlation between TTS and personal exposure was higher at 4 kHz than the low and high frequencies.CONCLUSIONS: Contemporary music may be an important yet little considered contributor to total personal noise exposure, especially amongst young employees. Employees need to be better informed of risks of hearing loss and the need to report changes in hearing acuity. Suggestions are made on strategies for improving the assessment of noise exposure in entertainment venues."
"12001022","[Follow-up assessment of intratympanic gentamicin therapy and Saccotomia in Menière's Disease].","BACKGROUND: The intratympanic application of ototoxic antibiotics and saccotomia have been well documented in severe cases of one-sided Menière's disease for 30 years now. Both treatment methods are still subject to controversial discussion.PATIENTS AND MATERIAL: This study includes 8 patients suffering from persistent one-sided Menière's disease after treatment with gentamicin application and additional saccotomia (n=2). We performed follow-up visits including the assessment of hearing ability, vestibular function and cranial MRI, 2-10 years after onset of treatment.RESULTS: After therapeutic interventions 7 patients reported to be healed of their symptom vertigo. In 4 patients the gentamicin-treated vestibular organ did not respond to thermic stimulus at the time of follow-up examination. Auditory threshold shift was observed in 3 patients (1 permanent, 2 temporary), whereas hearing threshold improved in 2 patients. Tinnitus was attenuated in 3 patients, while 1 patient suffered from posttherapeutic onset of tinnitus. Morphological and structural changes due to Menière's disease and treatment procedures were ruled out by cranial MRI.CONCLUSION: The intratympanic application of ototoxic medication is a safe and effective treatment method in severe cases of Menière's disease. Saccotomia should be considered as therapeutic regimen for persistent symptoms after repeated application of gentamicin."
"12869924","Short-duration space flight and hearing loss.","OBJECTIVES: The study goal was to determine whether a single Space Shuttle mission can induce decrements in astronaut hearing. Study design We retrospectively compared audiogram information obtained from Space Shuttle astronauts at 10 days preflight, day of return (R + 0), 3 days after landing return (R + 3), and at a mean delayed postflight follow-up of 8 months.RESULTS: Temporary threshold shift (mean, 4.6 dB) was noted in R + 0 versus preflight conditions (P &lt; 0.01). Small permanent threshold shifts (mean, 0.83 dB) were found at R + 3 and postflight follow-up compared with preflight in the lower frequencies (500 to 2000 Hz), and corresponding pure tone average (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions and significance The data indicate that a single Shuttle flight can induce a substantial temporary threshold shift and a small but statistically significant permanent threshold shift, particularly in the frequencies involved in speech reception. Although single-mission effects are small, cumulative effects over several missions may ultimately produce clinically significant hearing loss."
"15457813","A longitudinal study of changes in evoked otoacoustic emissions and pure-tone thresholds as measured in a hearing conservation program.","Non-linear transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) at 74dB pSPL, distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) at 65/45dB SPL and pure-tone audiometry were used to detect noise-induced, inner car changes in a longitudinal study. Repeated-measures ANOVAs were made on the Noise (n=69) and Quiet (n=42) groups. The Noise group's hearing thresholds increased by 1.2 dB and DPOAE amplitude decreased by -0.9 dB. For both groups, TEOAE amplitude decreased by approximately -0.6 dB. Eight of 12 ears with permanent threshold shift (PTS) and 10 of 13 ears with temporary threshold shift (TTS) showed TEOAE decrements or low baseline TEOAE amplitudes. Fewer TTS and PTS ears also showed DPOAE decrements, and there was never a DPOAE decrement without a corresponding TEOAE decrement or low TEOAE baseline. Some TTS ears showed permanent emission decrements. Although otoacoustic emissions show promise in detecting noise-induced inner ear changes, it is premature to use them in hearing conservation programs."
"16377998","Estimating noise-induced permanent threshold shift from audiometric shape: the ISO-1999 model.","OBJECTIVE: To describe the relation between audiometric shape and noise-induced permanent threshold shift averaged across the speech frequencies (N5123).DESIGN: Using an international standard (ISO-1999), 270 audiograms were created, representing both sexes and a variety of ages, exposure levels, and percentiles. Bulge depth (BD) was defined as the difference between pure-tone average for 2, 3, and 4 kHz and PTA for 1 and 6 kHz.RESULTS: N5123 was well-predicted by quadratic functions of BD, which accounted for 72 to 95% of the variance in N5123.CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of N5123, based on BD, can be helpful in medical-legal diagnosis and allocation of hearing loss."
"15913155","Recreational noise exposure and its effects on the hearing of adolescents. Part II: development of hearing disorders.","Part II, continuation of a previous paper, describes the significant hearing threshold shift found during the third year of the long-term study, which continued to be present in the fourth year, in a number of adolescents classified as Subgroup 2, who showed a higher mean HTL in the middle and especially in the high frequency ranges than the rest of the studied adolescents, classified as Subgroup 1. In both subgroups, the subjects showed high participation in recreational activities; nevertheless, the adolescents in Subgroup 2 showed higher participation in some of them in the last year of the study. From the beginning of the study, the mean HTL of the adolescents in Subgroup 2 was higher than the mean HTL of the adolescents in Subgroup 1. The exposure to high sound levels during leisure activities can be a cause of permanent hearing damage among young people with 'tender ears'."
"15703144","Critical period for styrene ototoxicity in the rat.","The current experiments were undertaken to determine whether or not styrene-induced hearing loss in the rat depends more on the existence of a critical period between 14 and 21 weeks of age than on body weight. For these purposes, two experiments were carried out with mature Long-Evans rats. In the first experiment, two groups of 5-month old rats, but having different body weight (slim: 314 g vs. fat: 415 g) were exposed to 700 ppm styrene for 4 consecutive weeks, 5 days per week, 6 hours per day. In the second experiment, two groups of rats having the same weight: 345 g, but different ages (14- vs. 21- week old) were exposed to styrene in strictly identical experimental conditions. Auditory sensitivity was tested by recording evoked potentials from the inferior colliculus. Surface preparations of the organ of Corti were also performed to complete the investigation. At the end of the six week recovery period following the styrene exposure, a 7 dB permanent threshold shift (PTS) was obtained with the same age animals regardless of the body weight. Consequently, weight was not a major factor in styrene-induced hearing loss. Age was a more critical factor in determining higher sensitivity to styrene. Indeed, the three months old group had 23.5 dB PTS, whereas the five months old group had only a 7.7 dB PTS at 16 kHz. Thus, a 15 dB difference of PTS was obtained between the rats having the same weight but different age. While the weight does not play a major role in styrene ototoxicity, there is a critical period whose duration lasts more than three months and for which the susceptibility to styrene is enhanced."
"16875225","Low-level otoacoustic emissions may predict susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss.","In a longitudinal study with 338 volunteers, audiometric thresholds and otoacoustic emissions were measured before and after 6 months of noise exposure on an aircraft carrier. While the average amplitudes of the otoacoustic emissions decreased significantly, the average audiometric thresholds did not change. Furthermore, there were no significant correlations between changes in audiometric thresholds and changes in otoacoustic emissions. Changes in transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions were moderately correlated. Eighteen ears acquired permanent audiometric threshold shifts. Only one-third of those ears showed significant otoacoustic emission shifts that mirrored their permanent threshold shifts. A Bayesian analysis indicated that permanent threshold shift status following a deployment was predicted by baseline low-level or absent otoacoustic emissions. The best predictor was transient-evoked otoacoustic emission amplitude in the 4-kHz half-octave frequency band, with risk increasing more than sixfold from approximately 3% to 20% as the emission amplitude decreased. It is possible that the otoacoustic emissions indicated noise-induced changes in the inner ear, undetected by audiometric tests. Otoacoustic emissions may therefore be a diagnostic predictor for noise-induced-hearing-loss risk."
"18420380","Toluene-induced hearing loss in acivicin-treated rats.","Toluene can be considered an ototoxic chemical compound in the rat. Outer hair cells are particularly sensitive to this aromatic organic solvent or to one of its metabolites. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the possible role played by cysteine S-conjugates in the ototoxic process in Long-Evans rats. To this end, renal and hepatic metabolism of toluene was modified by treatment with acivicin, an inhibitor of gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma-GT). First, the efficacy of the acivicin treatment was established from a dose-response investigation in which urinary gamma-GT was measured daily in rats exposed to 1750 ppm toluene, 6 h per day for five days. A twice weekly 5 mg/kg dose was reduced urinary gamma-GT by 70-78%. In a subacute experiment, rats were exposed to 1750 ppm toluene for four consecutive weeks, in which the efficacy of the acivicin treatment was monitored by quantifying the urinary end product of the conjugate pathway: benzyl mercapturic acid (BMA). A 38.5% decrease in BMA was measured at the end of the exposure period. Hearing impairment was evaluated using auditory (inferior colliculus) evoked potentials and completed with conventional histological approaches. The toluene-exposed and the acivicin-treated rats exposed to toluene both had a 7-dB permanent auditory threshold shift at 16-20 kHz. Hair cell loss was not dependent on acivicin treatment. Therefore, the partial inhibition of gamma-GT did not modify the toluene ototoxicity, suggesting that toluene-induced hearing loss is not strongly mediated by the production of cysteine S-conjugates. However, the data do not rule out the possibility that these metabolites may play a minor role."
"18189581","Onset, growth, and recovery of in-air temporary threshold shift in a California sea lion (Zalophus californianus).","A California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) was tested in a behavioral procedure to assess noise-induced temporary threshold shift (TTS) in air. Octave band fatiguing noise was varied in both duration (1.5-50 min) and level (94-133 dB re 20 muPa) to generate a variety of equal sound exposure level conditions. Hearing thresholds were measured at the center frequency of the noise (2500 Hz) before, immediately after, and 24 h following exposure. Threshold shifts generated from 192 exposures ranged up to 30 dB. Estimates of TTS onset [159 dB re (20 muPa)(2) s] and growth (2.5 dB of TTS per dB of noise increase) were determined using an exponential function. Recovery for threshold shifts greater than 20 dB followed an 8.8 dB per log(min) linear function. Repeated testing indicated possible permanent threshold shift at the test frequency, but a later audiogram revealed no shift at this frequency or higher. Sea lions appear to be equally susceptible to noise in air and in water, provided that the noise exposure levels are referenced to absolute sound detection thresholds in both media. These data provide a framework within which to consider effects arising from more intense and/or sustained exposures."
"19766602","Follow-up of latency and threshold shifts of auditory brainstem responses after single and interrupted acoustic trauma in guinea pig.","Thresholds of auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) are widely used to estimate the level of noise-induced hearing loss or the level of acquired resistance to acoustic trauma after repeated exposures, i.e., the &quot;toughening&quot; effect. Less is known about ABR latencies and their relation to threshold changes. Guinea pigs were exposed to a traumatic pure tone at 5 kHz, 120 dB SPL, as either single (2 h, 4 h) or repeated (1 h every 48 h, four times) sessions. Thresholds and latencies of ABRs were monitored up to 45 days following the acoustic trauma. We show that latencies are prolonged in the case of large temporary threshold shifts observed in the days following trauma. The latency shift decreases after several repeated exposures, then stabilizes, similar to thresholds, suggesting that the &quot;toughening&quot; effect also applies to latencies. Permanent latency shift is usually very small compared to the permanent threshold shift. This effect could produce a recovery in the ability to process auditory information through the precise timing of neuronal events. Our study indicates that when estimated at suprathreshold stimulation level (70 dB SPL), latency provides complementary information to the sole threshold."
"19597738","The effect of active sonar for the protection of moored and anchored warships on the human hearing.","This study wants to show the effects of active middle frequency sonar on a selected group of Italian Navy divers. Ten male divers with normal hearing were exposed to active sonar of the Italian Navy for more than 100 exposures, each of at least 1-h duration, in the course of 6 months. Before, at the end, and six months after the end of noise exposure, we performed pure-tone audiometry, Carhart test, Peyser test, thresholds of discomfort test (TDT), tympanometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), and auditory brainstem response (ABR). At the end of the noise exposure, the audiological tests showed a worsening of the mean air and bone audiometric thresholds at the 2,000 (1/10), 4,000 (7/10), and 8,000 Hz (6/10); a fail status of the TEOAE and DPOAE, which were previously present, in all the divers; temporary threshold shift, at the Peyser test, in 9/10 divers; discomfort for pulse tone presented at the TDT test, in all the divers; no post exposure significant differences at the Carhart and ABR tests, in any of the divers. Six months after the end of noise exposure, all the divers presented a complete recovery of their audio-vestibular functions. Our results show the temporary negative effects of repeated and lasting exposure to active sonar (Hull MF) on the divers; the last control demonstrate the absence of permanent noise-induced hearing loss in divers exposed to active sonar."
"20160390","Noise induced hearing loss risk assessment in truck drivers.","Hearing sense is one of the key elements which may have impact on the driver's task quality. This cross-sectional study investigates the hearing status of 500 truck drivers by pure tone audiometry (AC) in one of the cities in Fars province, Iran. Hearing threshold levels of the subjects were measured in frequencies of 500Hz-8000Hz. Screening and determination of permanent threshold shift (PTS) was the first aim of this study. Hence tests were done at least 16 hours after any exposure to noticeable sound. The effect of age as a confounding factor was considered using ISO equation and subtracted from whole hearing threshold. The threshold of 25 dB HL and above was considered abnormal but the calculation of hearing was also carried out using 0 dB HL as reference. Subjects were categorized into two groups on the basis of working experience and the hearing threshold of 25 dB was considered a boundary of normal hearing sense. The results of Pearson Chi-Square test showed that working experience as an independent variable has significant contributing effect on hearing thresholds of truck drivers in frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz (p greater than 0.05). Also, it was shown that currently nine and 12.6 % of truck drivers suffer from impaired hearing sense in left and right respectively (hearing threshold level greater than 25 dB) in mid frequencies (500, 1000, 2000 Hz) and 45% in high frequencies of both ears (4000 and 8000 Hz). The results indicated that hearing damage of professional drivers was expected to occur sooner at 4000 and 8000 Hz than lower frequencies. Finally it was deduced that the occupational conditions of truck drivers may have bilateral, symmetrical harmful effect on hearing threshold sense in all frequencies mainly in frequency of 4000 Hz, so health surveillance programs such as education and periodic medical examinations are emphasized for pre-diagnosing and prevention of any possible impairment and an urgent need to take up some interventions such as better maintenance of roads, automobile industry efforts to reduce the noise level emission of vehicles and reducing number of working hours per day of drivers are highlighted to improve the harmful working conditions of truck drivers."
"22122960","Increased vitamin plasma levels in Swedish military personnel treated with nutrients prior to automatic weapon training.","Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a significant clinical, social, and economic issue. The development of novel therapeutic agents to reduce NIHL will potentially benefit multiple very large noise-exposed populations. Oxidative stress has been identified as a significant contributor to noise-induced sensory cell death and NIHL, and several antioxidant strategies have now been suggested for potential translation to human subjects. One such strategy is a combination of beta-carotene, vitamins C and E, and magnesium, which has shown promise for protection against NIHL in rodent models, and is being evaluated in a series of international human clinical trials using temporary (military gunfire, audio player use) and permanent (stamping factory, military airbase) threshold shift models (NCT00808470). The noise exposures used in the recently completed Swedish military gunfire study described in this report did not, on average, result in measurable changes in auditory function using conventional pure-tone thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) amplitudes as metrics. However, analysis of the plasma samples confirmed significant elevations in the bloodstream 2 hours after oral consumption of active clinical supplies, indicating the dose is realistic. The plasma outcomes are encouraging, but clinical acceptance of any novel therapeutic critically depends on demonstration that the agent reduces noise-induced threshold shift in randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective human clinical trials. Although this noise insult did not induce hearing loss, the trial design and study protocol can be applied to other populations exposed to different noise insults."
"21708356","Nutrient plasma levels achieved during treatment that reduces noise-induced hearing loss.","Hearing loss encompasses both temporary and permanent deficits. If temporary threshold shift (TTS) and permanent threshold shift (PTS) share common pathological mechanisms, then agents that reduce PTS also should reduce TTS. Several antioxidant agents have reduced PTS in rodent models; however, reductions in TTS have been inconsistent. This study first determined whether dietary antioxidants (beta-carotene and vitamins C and E) delivered in combination with magnesium (Mg) reliably increase plasma concentrations of the active agents. Then, additional manipulations tested the hypothesis that these nutrients reduce acute TTS insult in the first 24 h after loud sound as well as longer lasting changes in hearing measured up to 7 days postnoise. Saline or nutrients were administered to guinea pigs prior to and after noise exposure. Sound-evoked electrophysiological responses were measured before noise, with tests repeated 1-h postnoise, as well as 1-day, 3-days, 5-days, and 7-days postnoise. All subjects showed significant functional recovery; subjects treated with nutrients recovered more rapidly and had better hearing outcomes at early postnoise times as well as the final test time. Thus, this combination of nutrients, which produced significant increases in plasma concentrations of vitamins C and E and Mg, effectively reduced hearing loss at multiple postnoise times. These data suggest that free radical formation contributes to TTS as well as PTS insults and suggest a potential opportunity to prevent TTS in human populations."
"21246211","Hearing loss in divers: a 6-year prospective study.","Occupational diving is associated with hearing loss, but the cause is disputed. Our aim was to follow a cohort of divers through the first 6 years of their career in order to look for evidence of permanent threshold shift associated with diving activity, occupational noise exposure or acute injuries. Hearing was measured by pure tone audiometry in 67 participants at a basic course for working divers. Hearing thresholds were adjusted for age (ISO 7029). The subjects were examined and interviewed by an otologist. Additional medical and exposure data were recorded in questionnaires and personal logbooks. The procedure was repeated after 3 and 6 years. None of the subjects suffered inner ear barotrauma or inner ear decompression sickness during follow-up. Middle ear barotrauma was common. The prevalence of subjective hearing difficulties increased during follow-up, and there was a significant threshold shift at 4 kHz (mean 2.6 dB, 95% confidence interval 0.9-4.3 dB). Both subjective and objective hearing loss was associated with occupational noise exposure, but not with diving frequency or with a history of middle ear barotrauma. In the absence of manifest inner ear barotrauma or inner ear decompression sickness, noise seems to be the most important cause of long-term hearing loss in occupational divers. This study did not find evidence of long-term hearing loss caused by uneventful diving per se."
"23257587","The use of the kurtosis metric in the evaluation of occupational hearing loss in workers in China: implications for hearing risk assessment.","This study examined: (1) the value of using the statistical metric, kurtosis [ß(t)], along with an energy metric to determine the hazard to hearing from high level industrial noise environments, and (2) the accuracy of the International Standard Organization (ISO-1999:1990) model for median noise-induced permanent threshold shift (NIPTS) estimates with actual recent epidemiological data obtained on 240 highly screened workers exposed to high-level industrial noise in China. A cross-sectional approach was used in this study. Shift-long temporal waveforms of the noise that workers were exposed to for evaluation of noise exposures and audiometric threshold measures were obtained on all selected subjects. The subjects were exposed to only one occupational noise exposure without the use of hearing protection devices. The results suggest that: (1) the kurtosis metric is an important variable in determining the hazards to hearing posed by a high-level industrial noise environment for hearing conservation purposes, i.e., the kurtosis differentiated between the hazardous effects produced by Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise environments, (2) the ISO-1999 predictive model does not accurately estimate the degree of median NIPTS incurred to high level kurtosis industrial noise, and (3) the inherent large variability in NIPTS among subjects emphasize the need to develop and analyze a larger database of workers with well-documented exposures to better understand the effect of kurtosis on NIPTS incurred from high level industrial noise exposures. A better understanding of the role of the kurtosis metric may lead to its incorporation into a new generation of more predictive hearing risk assessment for occupational noise exposure."
"23198571","[Audiometric findings of senior high school students belonging to a Kendo Club].","Between 1992 and 2010, we studied audiometric findings obtained from the annual hearing examination for senior high-school students who belonged to an active Kendo team. The subjects comprised 140 males and 88 females with ages between 15 and 18 years. The pure tone audiometry showed that 69 ears of 45 students (19.7%) had sensorineural hearing loss with the highest threshold shift at 2000 Hz, followed by 4000 Hz. Frequent audiometric patterns included a 2000 Hz-dip, a 4000 Hz-dip and a combined loss of 2000 and 4000 Hz. Some of these affected subjects had shown a completely normal audiogram at the previous examination. Moreover, small-dips with a depth less than 25 dB were found to be limited either at 2000 Hz or at 4000 Hz, suggesting early audiometric changes from a temporary or a permanent threshold shift caused by noise and/or head blows during Kendo practice. The incidence of such abnormal audiograms among this Kendo club members appears to be decreasing year by year owing to the annual check-ups over the 18-year study period, and student counseling regarding the possible adverse effect of Kendo on the inner ear function."
"22718110","Prevalence of permanent hearing threshold shift among workers of Indian iron and steel small and medium enterprises: a study.","Occupational noise exposure and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) have been recognized as a problem among workers in Indian industries. The major industries in India are based on manufacturing. There are appreciable numbers of casting and forging units spread across the country. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of permanent hearing threshold shift among the workers engaged in Indian iron and steel small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and compared with control group subjects. As a part of hearing protection intervention, audiometric tests were conducted at low (250-1000 Hz), medium (1500-3000 Hz), and high (4000-8000 Hz) frequencies. The occurrence of hearing loss was determined based on hearing threshold levels with a low fence of 25 dB. Comparisons were made for hearing threshold at different frequencies between the exposed and control groups using Student's t test. ANOVA was used for the comparison of hearing threshold dB at different frequencies among occupation and year of experience. A P value &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All data were presented as mean value (SD). Over 90% of workers engaged in various processes of casting and forging industry showed hearing loss in the noise-sensitive medium and higher frequencies. Occupation was significantly associated with NIHL, and hearing loss was particularly high among the workers of forging section. The analyses revealed a higher prevalence of significant hearing loss among the forging workers compared to the workers associated with other activities. The study shows alarming signals of NIHL, especially in forging workers. The occupational exposure to noise could be minimized by efficient control measures through engineering controls, administrative controls, and the use of personal protective devices. Applications of engineering and/or administrative controls are frequently not feasible in the developing countries for technical and financial reasons. A complete hearing conservation programme, including training, audiometry, job rotation, and the use of hearing protection devices, is the most feasible method for the protection of industrial workers from prevailing noise in workplace environments in the developing countries."
"22710537","Prevalence of noise induced hearing loss among traffic police personnel of Kathmandu Metropolitan City.","BACKGROUND: Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a major preventable occupational health hazard.OBJECTIVE: To measure permanent threshold shift in traffic police personnel due to noise exposure and to examine whether it was associated with duration of noise exposure, years of work and risk factors.METHODS: Cross sectional, descriptive study conducted at Dhulikhel hospital, Kathmandu University Hospital in 110 responding traffic police personnel. Detailed history and clinical examination of ear, impedence audiometry and pure tone audiometry was performed.RESULTS: Mean age group was 29.82 years; 82(74.5%) were males and 28 (25.5%) were females. Mean duration of service is 11.86 years. Twenty six (23.6%) had tinnitus and 39(35.5%) had blocked sensation in ear. Sixty five (59.1%) worked between 10- 19 years. Alcohol and smoking shows positive impact on NIHL (p value =0.00). Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval were 4.481 (1.925-10.432) and 6.578 (2.306- 18.764) respectively. Among 73(66.4%) noise induced hearing loss positive cases, bilateral involvement was seen in 45 (40.9%) and unilateral in 28(25.4 %) cases. Among unilateral cases most were left sided. Hearing threshold at 4 kHz increased according to age and duration of service.CONCLUSION: Traffic police personnel are in constant risk of noise induced hearing loss. Screening for hearing loss is recommended for people exposed to noise."
"23862780","Comparative temporary threshold shifts in a harbor porpoise and harbor seal, and severe shift in a seal.","Anthropogenic noise may cause temporary hearing threshold shifts (TTSs) in marine mammals. Tests with identical methods show that harbor porpoises are more susceptible to TTS induced by octave-band white noise (OBN) centered around 4<U+2009>kHz than harbor seals, although their unmasked (basic) hearing thresholds for that frequency are similar. A harbor seal was exposed for 1<U+2009>h to an OBN with a very high sound pressure level (SPL), 22-30<U+2009>dB above levels causing TTS onset. This elicited 44<U+2009>dB TTS; hearing recovered within 4 days. Thus, for this signal and this single exposure, permanent threshold shift requires levels at least 22 dB above TTS onset levels. The severe TTS in the seal suggests that the critical level (above which TTS increases rapidly with increasing SPL) is between 150 and 160<U+2009>dB re 1<U+2009>µPa for a 60<U+2009>min exposure to OBN centered at 4<U+2009>kHz. In guidelines on TTS in marine mammals produced by policy makers in many countries, TTS is assumed to follow the equal energy hypothesis, so that when the sound exposure levels of fatiguing sounds are equal, the same TTS is predicted to be induced. However, like previous studies, the present study calls this model into question. "
"24805896","Proposed comprehensive ototoxicity monitoring program for VA healthcare (COMP-VA).","Prevention and rehabilitation of hearing loss and tinnitus, the two most commonly awarded service-connected disabilities, are high priority initiatives in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). At least 4,000 Veterans, most with significant hearing loss, will receive cisplatin this year, with more than half sustaining permanent hearing shift and nearly 40% developing new tinnitus. With improved survivability following cancer treatment, Veterans treated with cisplatin are approached with the dual goals of effective treatment and preserved quality of life. This article describes COMP-VA, a comprehensive ototoxicity monitoring program developed for VA patients receiving cisplatin. The program includes an individualized pretreatment prediction model that identifies the likelihood of hearing shift given cisplatin dose and patient factors. It supports both manual and automated hearing testing with a newly developed portable audiometer capable of performing the recommended procedures on the chemotherapy unit during treatment. It also includes objective methods for identifying outer hair cell changes and predicting audiogram changes using distortion-product otoacoustic emissions. We describe this program of evidence-based ototoxicity monitoring protocols using a case example to give the reader an understanding of how this program would be applied, along with a plan for future work to accomplish the final stages of program development.

"24603543","Hearing loss in relation to sound exposure of professional symphony orchestra musicians.","OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to: (1) estimate the hearing status of classical symphony orchestra musicians and (2) investigate the hypothesis that occupational sound exposure of symphony orchestra musicians leads to elevated hearing thresholds.DESIGN: The study population comprised all the musicians from five symphony orchestras. Questionnaires were filled in by 337 subjects, and 212 subjects performed an audiometric test. For a group of 182 musicians (363 ears) the results of the audiometry was analyzed in relation to the individual exposure, which was estimated on the basis of sound measurements and questionnaire data regarding the exposure time. The mean hearing threshold at the frequencies 3, 4, and 6 kHz, corrected for age and sex, was used as outcome.RESULTS: The musician ears with the highest exposure (29 of 363) had an additional threshold shift of 6.3 dB compared with the 238 ears with lowest exposure. The observed hearing loss of musicians was smaller compared with the noise-induced permanent threshold shift (NIPTS) predicted from ISO1999. A remaining confounding effect of age after ISO7029 age corrections could be observed to explain the difference in observed and predicted NIPTS. However, the observed hearing loss difference between the left and the right ear of musicians was 2.5 dB (95% confidence interval 1.5-3.6), which was similar to the NIPTS predicted from ISO1999. Most of the musicians had better hearing at 3, 4, and 6 kHz for age than expected, however, 29 ears with the highest exposure above 90.4 dBA with a mean exposure time of 41.7 years had significantly elevated hearing thresholds. Trumpet players and the left ear of first violinists had significantly elevated hearing thresholds compared with other musicians.CONCLUSION: Most of the symphony orchestra musicians had better hearing than expected but they had a work-related risk of developing additional noise-induced hearing loss. The additional NITPS of the left ear compared with the right ear was at the expected level based on the cumulated sound exposure and ISO1999, indicating that performing music may induce hearing loss to the same extent as industrial noise."
"26572701","Hearing loss and tinnitus in rock musicians: A Norwegian survey.","Our focus in this study was to assess hearing thresholds and the prevalence and characteristics of tinnitus in a large group of rock musicians based in Norway. A further objective was to assess related factors such as exposure, instrument category, and the preventive effect of hearing protection. The study was a cross-sectional survey of rock musicians selected at random from a defined cohort of musicians. A random control group was included for comparison. We recruited 111 active musicians from the Oslo region, and a control group of 40 nonmusicians from the student population at the University of TromsØ. The subjects were investigated using clinical examination, pure tone audiometry, tympanometry, and a questionnaire. We observed a hearing loss in 37.8% of the rock musicians. Significantly poorer hearing thresholds were seen at most pure-tone frequencies in musicians than controls, with the most pronounced threshold shift at 6 kHz. The use of hearing protection, in particular custom-fitted earplugs, has a preventive effect but a minority of rock musicians apply them consistently. The degree of musical performance exposure was inversely related to the degree of hearing loss in our sample. Bass and guitar players had higher hearing thresholds than vocalists. We observed a 20% prevalence of chronic tinnitus but none of the affected musicians had severe tinnitus symptomatology. There was no statistical association between permanent tinnitus and hearing loss in our sample. We observed an increased prevalence of hearing loss and tinnitus in our sample of Norwegian rock musicians but the causal relationship between musical exposure and hearing loss or tinnitus is ambiguous. We recommend the use of hearing protection in rock musicians. "
"25920815","Effects of exposure to intermittent and continuous 6-7 kHz sonar sweeps on harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) hearing.","Safety criteria for mid-frequency naval sonar sounds are needed to protect harbor porpoise hearing. A porpoise was exposed to sequences of one-second 6-7 kHz sonar down-sweeps, with 10-200 sweeps in a sequence, at an average received sound pressure level (SPLav.re.) of 166 dB re 1 µPa, with duty cycles of 10% (intermittent sounds) and 100% (continuous). Behavioral hearing thresholds at 9.2 kHz were determined before and after exposure to the fatiguing noise, to quantify temporary hearing threshold shifts (TTS1-4 min) and recovery. Significant TTS1-4 min occurred after 10-25 sweeps when the duty cycle was 10% (cumulative sound exposure level, SELcum: ~178 dB re 1 µPa(2)s). For the same SELcum, the TTS1-4 min was greater for exposures with 100% duty cycle. The difference in TTS between the two duty cycle exposures increased as the number of sweeps in the exposure sequences increased. Therefore, to predict TTS and permanent threshold shift, not only SELcum needs to be known, but also the duty cycle or equivalent sound pressure level (Leq). It appears that the injury criterion for non-pulses proposed by Southall, Bowles, Ellison, Finneran, Gentry, Greene, Kastak, Ketten, Miller, Nachtigall, Richardson, Thomas, and Tyack [(2007). Aquat. Mamm. 33, 411-521] for cetaceans echolocating at high frequency (SEL 215 dB re 1 µPa(2)s) is too high for the harbor porpoise. "
"25620313","Efficacy and safety of N-acetylcysteine in prevention of noise induced hearing loss: a randomized clinical trial.","Despite a robust hearing conservation program, military personnel continue to be at high risk for noise induced hearing loss (NIHL). For more than a decade, a number of laboratories have investigated the use of antioxidants as a safe and effective adjunct to hearing conservation programs. Of the antioxidants that have been investigated, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has consistently reduced permanent NIHL in the laboratory, but its clinical efficacy is still controversial. This study provides a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating the safety profile and the efficacy of NAC to prevent hearing loss in a military population after weapons training. Of the 566 total study subjects, 277 received NAC while 289 were given placebo. The null hypothesis for the rate of STS was not rejected based on the measured results. While no significant differences were found for the primary outcome, rate of threshold shifts, the right ear threshold shift rate difference did approach significance (p = 0.0562). No significant difference was found in the second primary outcome, percentage of subjects experiencing an adverse event between placebo and NAC groups (26.7% and 27.4%, respectively, p = 0.4465). Results for the secondary outcome, STS rate in the trigger hand ear, did show a significant difference (34.98% for placebo-treated, 27.14% for NAC-treated, p-value = 0.0288). Additionally, post-hoc analysis showed significant differences in threshold shift rates when handedness was taken into account. While the secondary outcomes and post-hoc analysis suggest that NAC treatment is superior to the placebo, the present study design failed to confirm this. The lack of significant differences in overall hearing loss between the treatment and placebo groups may be due to a number of factors, including suboptimal dosing, premature post-exposure audiograms, or differences in risk between ears or subjects. Based on secondary outcomes and post hoc analyses however, further studies seem warranted and are needed to clarify dose response and the factors that may have played a role in the observed results.

"27518134","Guidelines for Auditory Threshold Measurement for Significant Threshold Shift.","The purpose of this article is to provide guidelines for determining a Significant Noise-Induced Threshold Shift in clinical trials involving human populations. The article reviews recommendations for the standards to be referenced for human subjects, equipment, test environment, and personnel. Additional guidelines for military populations are provided. Guidelines for the calibration of audiometers, sound booth noise levels, and immitance equipment are provided. In addition the guidance provides specific suggestions for the subjects history before study onset, and otoscopy.Test frequencies for threshold determination and methods of threshold determination are reviewed for both air conduction and bone conduction for both baseline testing and later determination of either a temporary (TTS) or permanent threshold shift (PTS). Once a Significant Noise-Induced Threshold Shift has been determined, subjects should be retested, conductive component should be ruled out or addressed, and the subject should be counseled or referred for additional medical evaluation. Guidance for reporting procedures and the computerized study database are described. Finally, experimental designs suggested for noise-induced otoprotection clinical trials are described."
"27349914","Prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex vs. auditory brainstem response for hearing assessment.","The high prevalence of noise-induced and age-related hearing loss in the general population has warranted the use of animal models to study the etiology of these pathologies. Quick and accurate auditory threshold determination is a prerequisite for experimental manipulations targeting hearing loss in animal models. The standard auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurement is fairly quick and translational across species, but is limited by the need for anesthesia and a lack of perceptual assessment. The goal of this study was to develop a new method of hearing assessment utilizing prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle reflex, a commonly used tool that measures detection thresholds in awake animals, and can be performed on multiple animals simultaneously. We found that in control mice PPI audiometric functions are similar to both ABR and traditional operant conditioning audiograms. The hearing thresholds assessed with PPI audiometry in sound exposed mice were also similar to those detected by ABR thresholds one day after exposure. However, three months after exposure PPI threshold shifts were still evident at and near the frequency of exposure whereas ABR thresholds recovered to the pre-exposed level. In contrast, PPI audiometry and ABR wave one amplitudes detected similar losses. PPI audiometry provides a high throughput automated behavioral screening tool of hearing in awake animals. Overall, PPI audiometry and ABR assessments of the auditory system are robust techniques with distinct advantages and limitations, which when combined, can provide ample information about the functionality of the auditory system."

"26720128","Prevalence of permanent threshold shifts in the United States Air Force hearing conservation program by career field, 2005-2011.","The purpose of this study was to describe changes in hearing, using the permanent threshold shift metric, among United States Air Force servicemembers, including active duty, Reserve and Air National Guard components, for demographics, job categories, and career fields. In the United States Air Force, only servicemembers who are occupationally exposed routinely to hazardous noise are monitored. Audiogram records and demographic variables were analyzed for servicemembers from 2005-2011 using data from the Department of Defense system that captures occupational hearing tests worldwide. Results suggest that occupational hearing loss was larger in males than females, in officers than enlisted populations, and in Reserve and Air National Guard than in active duty. Compared to similar civilian career fields, active duty has lower prevalence rates for occupational hearing loss overall, although Reserve and Air National Guard prevalence rates were more similar to the civilian reported rates. The proportion of personnel with permanent threshold shifts varied between 4.6-16.7% within active duty career fields, which includes 76% of the population for study timeframe. Permanent threshold shift was larger in small job categories, and in jobs that are not considered exposed to hazardous noise routinely which is comparative with results from civilian data analysis of occupational hearing loss. Further investigation into testing practices for Air Force specific groups, use of the system for nonoccupational hearing testing, and challenges to follow-up compliance is warranted. Increased surveillance procedures for occupational hearing loss are needed to address concerns on the prevalence of servicemember hearing loss, the role of recreational and lifestyle factors to contribute the high reported hearing loss prevalence of veterans compared to nonveterans.
