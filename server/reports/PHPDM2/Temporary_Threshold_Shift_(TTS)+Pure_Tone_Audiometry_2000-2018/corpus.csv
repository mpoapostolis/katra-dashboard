"11314916","The human temporary threshold shift after exposure to 60 minutes' noise in an aerobics class.","The potential hazard of noise to hearing is well documented. However, there are some experiences of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) that are not so well-known, for example the effects of leisure noise, and in particular, leisure noise experienced during an aerobics class. A preliminary study of the noise level in aerobics classes in the Manchester region was carried out and their mean noise level was found to be 89.6 dB(A) (+/-4.7 dB(A)). Pure tone thresholds in the audible frequency range were obtained from 28 young adult volunteers (mean age 21 years; standard deviation (SD) 2.3 years) and 14 subjects (the 'exposure' group) were then invited to join (but not participate in) an aerobics class (mean noise level 91.8 dB(A) (+/-1.5 dB(A)) for 60 minutes. The noise levels in the aerobics class were monitored throughout the 60 minutes and the subjects did not stray from a small marked area (2 m2). Subjects' hearing thresholds were obtained for a second time, beginning within 2 minutes of the cessation of the noise, and any temporary threshold shifts (TTS) were noted. A second group of 14 subjects (the control group) was invited for a second audiogram after at least 60 minutes, during which time subjects were not exposed to any noise. The data obtained here were analysed and of the 14 subjects in the exposure group all had significant TTS at all frequencies except 1,000 Hz. Subjects in the control group, who had not experienced any noise, showed significantly reduced hearing thresholds (all frequencies; p&gt;0.02), showing evidence of a possible practice effect with audiometric testing."

"12869924","Short-duration space flight and hearing loss.","OBJECTIVES: The study goal was to determine whether a single Space Shuttle mission can induce decrements in astronaut hearing. Study design We retrospectively compared audiogram information obtained from Space Shuttle astronauts at 10 days preflight, day of return (R + 0), 3 days after landing return (R + 3), and at a mean delayed postflight follow-up of 8 months.RESULTS: Temporary threshold shift (mean, 4.6 dB) was noted in R + 0 versus preflight conditions (P &lt; 0.01). Small permanent threshold shifts (mean, 0.83 dB) were found at R + 3 and postflight follow-up compared with preflight in the lower frequencies (500 to 2000 Hz), and corresponding pure tone average (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions and significance The data indicate that a single Shuttle flight can induce a substantial temporary threshold shift and a small but statistically significant permanent threshold shift, particularly in the frequencies involved in speech reception. Although single-mission effects are small, cumulative effects over several missions may ultimately produce clinically significant hearing loss."
"12701733","Effect of ipsilateral and contralateral low-frequency narrow-band noise on temporary threshold shift in humans.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of ipsilateral and contralateral low-frequency (250 Hz) narrow-band noise (NBN) on the temporary threshold shift (TTS) induced by a 2 kHz tone in young normally hearing subjects with a functioning auditory efferent system.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixteen young volunteers served as subjects. All the subjects were young (20-30 years), disease-free and had a medical history negative for otological disease, noise exposure and use of ototoxic drugs. They had normal hearing [thresholds of 125-8,000 Hz below 20 dB hearing level (HL)], transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions and contralateral suppression. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of three different groups. Subjects in Group A (n = 5) were exposed to a 90 dB HL 2 kHz pure tone for 10 min. Subjects in Group B (n = 6) were exposed to a 90 dB HL 2 kHz pure tone and an ipsilateral 45 dB HL 250 Hz NBN for 10 min. Subjects in Group C (n = 5) were exposed to a 90 dB HL 2 kHz pure tone and a contralateral 45 dB HL 250 Hz NBN for 10 min. The right ear served as the test ear. The TTS 2 min after the end of the exposure (TTS2) was measured in all subjects at 2, 3 and 4 kHz.RESULTS: TTS, in Group A was significantly higher at 3 kHz (p = 0.011) and at 4 kHz (p = 0.003) than TTS2 in Group B. At 4 kHz, TTS2 in Group C was significantly higher (p = 0.013) than TTS2 in Group B. Although TTS2 in Group C was lower than TTS2 in Group A, this difference was not significant. The presence of an ipsilateral low-frequency NBN significantly reduced TTS2 induced by a 90 dB HL 2 kHz tone. A contralateral low-frequency NBN reduced TTS2 in this group of subjects; however, the reduction was not significant.CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that an ipsilateral low-intensity, low-frequency (250 Hz) NBN can give protection from a TTS induced by a 2 kHz tone. Contralateral low-frequency NBN did not induce any protective effect."
"12564513","Temporary threshold shift in military pilots measured using conventional and extended high-frequency audiometry after one flight.","Noise of such a high level that it can result in hearing deterioration is an inherent characteristic of military flying. Susceptibility to hearing impairment was studied using 51 Finnish Air Force military personnel as subjects. The test persons flew missions on a British Aerospace Hawk 51 advanced jet trainer, Boeing F-18 Hornet, Mikoyan &amp; Gurevich MiG-21bis and Saab 35 Draken interceptors, and a Valmet Redigo turboprop liaison aircraft. The duration of noise exposure was one flight mission, which varied from 30 to 60 min. Noise doses and levels were measured using a miniature microphone at the inlet of the ear canal, while a second microphone was located at the level of the subject's shoulder. Hearing thresholds were measured before each flight using conventional (0.125-8 kHz) and extended high-frequency (EHF) (8.20 kHz) audiometry. The measurements were repeated as soon as possible after the flight. The study showed that the pre-flight threshold levels of the subjects were good. Both conventional and EHF audiometry revealed statistically significant temporary threshold shifts (TTS) at several frequencies and with all aircraft types involved. The changes were, however, minor. The risk of noise-induced hearing impairment at the studied exposure levels is, in all probability, rather small. The role of extended high-frequency audiometry would be in research, and it might be performed for flying personnel upon entering service and every fifth year thereafter."
"15457813","A longitudinal study of changes in evoked otoacoustic emissions and pure-tone thresholds as measured in a hearing conservation program.","Non-linear transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) at 74dB pSPL, distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) at 65/45dB SPL and pure-tone audiometry were used to detect noise-induced, inner car changes in a longitudinal study. Repeated-measures ANOVAs were made on the Noise (n=69) and Quiet (n=42) groups. The Noise group's hearing thresholds increased by 1.2 dB and DPOAE amplitude decreased by -0.9 dB. For both groups, TEOAE amplitude decreased by approximately -0.6 dB. Eight of 12 ears with permanent threshold shift (PTS) and 10 of 13 ears with temporary threshold shift (TTS) showed TEOAE decrements or low baseline TEOAE amplitudes. Fewer TTS and PTS ears also showed DPOAE decrements, and there was never a DPOAE decrement without a corresponding TEOAE decrement or low TEOAE baseline. Some TTS ears showed permanent emission decrements. Although otoacoustic emissions show promise in detecting noise-induced inner ear changes, it is premature to use them in hearing conservation programs."
"15198380","The effects of 'supra-physiological' vitamin B12 administration on temporary threshold shift.","The aim of this study was to evaluate, in 20 young volunteer subjects, the effects of supra-physiological vitamin B12 administration on noise-induced temporary threshold shift (TTS). All subjects had hearing thresholds within 15 dBHL and type A tympanograms. The subjects were randomly assigned to two different groups. Experimental group subjects received cyanocobalamin, 1 mg daily for 7 days, and 5 mg on the eighth day. Control group subjects received a placebo injection daily for 8 days. The vitamin B12 concentration, hearing thresholds and TTS2 (10 min of exposure, narrowband noise centred at 3 kHz, bandwidth of 775 Hz, 112 dBSPL) were measured before and 8 days after treatment. At the end of treatment, the serum vitamin B12 concentration was significantly increased in the experimental group. After 8 days of treatment, the control group showed the same hearing thresholds and TTS2 degrees. Statistical analysis showed that TTS2 decreased significantly at 3 and 4kHz when cobalamin was used to increase the serum concentration of vitamin B12 to &gt; 2350 pg/ml. In addition, a protective effect at 3 kHz in the experimental group was evident when compared with the placebo group. These results suggest that elevated plasma cyanocobalamin levels may reduce the risk of hearing dysfunction resulting from noise exposure in healthy, young subjects."
"14979949","Noise induced hearing loss in dance music disc jockeys and an examination of sound levels in nightclubs.","Noise exposure, hearing loss and associated otological symptoms have been studied in a group of 23 disc jockeys using a questionnaire and pure tone audiometry. The level of noise exposure in the venues where they work has also been studied using Ametek Mk-3 audio dosimeters. Three members of the study group showed clear evidence of noise-induced hearing loss on audiometry, 70 per cent reported temporary threshold shift after sessions and 74 per cent reported tinnitus. Sound levels of up to 108 dB(A) were recorded in the nightclubs. The average level for a typical session was 96 dB(A) which is above the level at which the provision of ear protection is mandatory for employers in industry. It can be concluded that DJs are at substantial risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss and noise exposure in nightclubs frequently exceeds safe levels."
"14763230","Effects of discotheque music on audiometric results and central acoustic evoked neuromagnetic responses.","Audiograms and auditory evoked magnetic fields (AEFs) were observed in young male and female adults at different ages before and after being exposed to discotheque music for 4 hours. Sound pressure levels (SPLs) ranged from 95 dB (SPL) up to 130 dB (SPL). After exposure, subjects had temporary threshold shifts up to 20-25 dB, which almost disappeared after 2 hours. The majority of the subjects suffered from tinnitus that lasted approximately as long as the temporary threshold shift. Correspondingly, a transient delay and prolongation of the main component of the acoustically evoked magnetic field (AEF) negative wave, occurring 100 msec after stimulus (N100 m), was seen after this exposure; other components of the AEF (positive wave, occurring 50, 160, and 200 msec after stimulus [P50 m, P160 m, and P200 m, respectively]) occurred less often as compared to nonexposed controls. Because effects of vigilance on the AEF could be excluded, these changes can be related to the loud music, indicating an influence of noise on central auditory processing. The transient tinnitus could be caused by acoustic microinjuries (hidden acoustic predamage) of outer hair cells, leading to the persistent hearing threshold shifts from which many young adults aged 20-24 years are suffering. Occurrence of tinnitus closely coincides with the changes in hearing threshold and AEF, thus, a limitation of loudness in discotheques is needed to prevent this kind of hearing hazard."
"16266189","Temporary threshold shift in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) exposed to mid-frequency tones.","A behavioral response paradigm was used to measure hearing thresholds in bottlenose dolphins before and after exposure to 3 kHz tones with sound exposure levels (SELs) from 100 to 203 dB re 1 microPa2 s. Experiments were conducted in a relatively quiet pool with ambient noise levels below 55 dB re 1 microPa2/Hz at frequencies above 1 kHz. Experiments 1 and 2 featured 1-s exposures with hearing tested at 4.5 and 3 kHz, respectively. Experiment 3 featured 2-, 4-, and 8-s exposures with hearing tested at 4.5 kHz. For experiment 2, there were no significant differences between control and exposure sessions. For experiments 1 and 3, exposures with SEL=197 dB re 1 microPa2 s and SEL &gt; or = 195 dB re 1 microPa2 s, respectively, resulted in significantly higher TTS4 than control sessions. For experiment 3 at SEL= 195 dB re 1 microPa2 s, the mean TTS4 was 2.8 dB. These data are consistent with prior studies of TTS in dolphins exposed to pure tones and octave band noise and suggest that a SEL of 195 dB re 1 microPa2 s is a reasonable threshold for the onset of TTS in dolphins and white whales exposed to midfrequency tones."
"16213939","Electrocochleography is more sensitive than distortion-product otoacoustic emission test for detecting noise-induced temporary threshold shift.","OBJECTIVE: We investigated and compared the usefulness of the electrocochleography and distortion product otoacoustic emission tests for detecting the earliest noise-induced damage by analyzing the sensitivity and specificity of the 2 tests.STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study.METHODS: After listening to music at 90.3 +/- 4.2 dB in the same night-club for 2 hours continuously, 23 healthy normal ears experienced a temporary threshold shift exceeding 5 dB. Pure-tone audiometry, the distortion product otoacoustic emission test, and electrocochleography were performed before, immediately after, and 24 hours after the exposure.RESULTS: Before exposure, the measured distortion product/noise floor was 9.8 +/- 10.4, 23.5 +/- 6.4, 18.7 +/- 6.4, and 19.1 +/- 5.6 dB sound pressure level (SPL) at frequencies of 1, 2, 3, and 4 kHz, respectively. Immediately after exposure, it decreased significantly at 2, 3, and 4 kHz to 16.6 +/- 7.6, 12.5 +/- 6.8, and 14.8 +/- 7.7 dB SPL, respectively. Marked increases in the amplitude of the summating potential and summating potential/action potential ratio were recorded from 0.15 +/- 0.06 to 0.32 +/- 0.11 and 0.23 +/- 0.06 to 0.44 +/- 0.08, respectively. The respective sensitivity and specificity of electrocochleography were 76.7% to 88.5% and 91.0% to 100%. Those of the distortion product otoacoustic emission test were 54.8% to 62.2% and 75.5% to 87.0%, respectively.CONCLUSION: Electrocochleography appears to provide more sensitive and specific information than the distortion product otoacoustic emission test for detecting a noise-induced temporary threshold shift."
"17147841","Temporary threshold shift due to recreational firearm use.","OBJECTIVE: To assess whether a temporary threshold shift occurred after recreational firearm use.DESIGN: An observational study of 25 subjects using ear protection in an indoor rifle range. Hearing was evaluated before and after shooting five rounds with a 0.22 calibre rifle over 10 minutes. A threshold shift of 5 dB was found to be statistically significant, while a shift of 10 dB was clinically significant.RESULTS: Twenty-four candidates had a statistically significant threshold shift, while 12 had a clinically significant threshold shift. Two subjects with previous industrial noise exposure had threshold shifts at more frequencies than other subjects. There was no significant preference for either ear. One subject showed no changes.CONCLUSION: This small study sheds some light on impulse noise behaviour in an indoor shooting range, but no definite conclusions can be drawn. The side of shooting did not influence threshold changes in either ear."
"16871954","[Analysis of hearing threshold shift measured by otoacoustic emissions in soldiers after shooting with use hearing protectors].","BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to assess the influence of short-term impulse noise on the size of temporary threshold shift in soldiers using hearing protectors during exposure.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study covered 80 subjects with normal tympanic membrane and thresholds measured by pure tone audiometry lower than 20 dB. There were two groups: I--composed of 40 soldiers protected during shooting and II--comprised 40 young males which did not shoot (controls). Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions were performed by an ILO 292 Echoport Otodynamics device 3-5 min before shooting and 2 min, 1, 2 and 3 h after shooting.RESULTS: The results showed that post-exposure changes in soldiers who used ear-muffs were not significant.CONCLUSION: The use of hearing protectors is strongly recommended because most of them seem to sufficiently attenuate impulse noise from firearms."
"16761701","Efficacy of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in protecting ears exposed to loud music.","Antioxidants have been reported to be effective in reducing acoustic trauma in animal models but have not been studied in humans. In this study, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was evaluated to determine if it would reduce temporary changes in auditory function as a result of exposure to loud music in humans. Pure-tone thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were collected in 31 normal-hearing participants, using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, before and after two hours of live music in a nightclub. Using repeated measures analysis of variance, no statistically significant differences were found between participants who received NAC versus a placebo for any of the outcome measures. Across all subjects, the largest pure-tone threshold shift occurred at 4 kHz. DPOAE measures were characterized by reductions in amplitude and a trend for shorter group delay values. When the 3 and 4 kHz data were examined by imposing specific criteria of greater than 2 dB DPOAE amplitude reductions and 10 dB or greater pure-tone threshold shifts, DPOAE reductions occurred more often at 3 kHz, and pure-tone shifts occurred more often at 4 kHz."
"17977289","An assessment of the effect of sound produced in a dental clinic on the hearing of dentists.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of sound produced in a dental clinic on the hearing of dentists in a dental school.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two dentists were evaluated for changes in their hearing thresholds at the Speech and Audiology Department, Manipal College of Allied Health Sciences, Manipal, India. Middle Ear Analyser (MEA), Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA) and Oto-Acoustic Emission (OAE) were used to evaluate changes in the hearing thresholds.RESULTS: There was a change in distortion product (DP) amplitude (temporary shift) in all frequencies. Statistically significant changes were found in the 6 kHz and 4 kHz ranges in the left ear and 6 kHz in the right ear. There was a larger DP shift in the left ear than in the right ear. A comparison of the hearing thresholds of males and females showed a significant difference of 3 kHz in the left ear, where males had a higher hearing loss.CONCLUSION: There were shifts of hearing threshold at 6 kHz and 4 kHz. The danger to hearing from dental clinic working environment in a dental school cannot be underestimated."
"17804978","An assessment of threshold shifts in nonprofessional pop/rock musicians using conventional and extended high-frequency audiometry.","The clinical value of extended high-frequency audiometry for the detection of noise-induced hearing loss has not been established conclusively. The purpose of this study was to assess the relative temporary threshold shift (TTS) in two frequency regions (conventional versus extended high frequency). In this exploratory study, pure-tone thresholds from 0.5 to 14 kHz were measured in both ears of 16 nonprofessional pop/rock musicians (mean age, 35 yr; range, 27 to 49 yr), before and after a 90-minute rehearsal session. All had experienced repeated exposures to intense sound levels during at least 5 yr of their musical careers. After the rehearsal, median threshold levels were found to be significantly poorer for frequencies from 0.5 to 8 kHz (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p &lt;or= 0.004) but were unchanged in the extended high-frequency range from 9 to 14 kHz. Decreases in the median threshold values measured before the rehearsal were present across the conventional frequency range, most notably at 6 kHz, but were not observed in the extended high-frequency range. On the basis of these results, extended high-frequency audiometry does not seem advantageous as a means of the early detection of noise-induced hearing loss."
"17614497","Overexposure effects of a 1-kHz tone on the distortion product otoacoustic emission in humans.","The effects of overexposure on the properties of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) are investigated. In total, 39 normal-hearing humans were monaurally exposed to a 1-kHz tone lasting for 3 min at an equivalent threshold sound-pressure level of 105.5 dB. The effects of overexposure were studied in two experiments (1) on the broadband DPOAE and (2) on the DPOAE fine structure, measured using a higher frequency resolution in a narrower frequency range. The obtained DPOAE shifts were compared to temporary threshold shift (TTS) obtained after a similar exposure. Similarities between DPOAE shifts and TTS were found in the affected frequency range and the time course of recovery. The amount of TTS was higher in the early recovery time (1-4-min postexposure), but similar to the DPOAE shift (even in absolute terms) at later recovery times (5-20-min postexposure). The DPOAE fine structure was not systematically changed after the exposure."

TEOAE were performed by ILO 292 Echoport Otodynamics device 3 to 5 minutes before shooting and 2 minutes and 1, 2, and 3 hours after shooting.RESULTS: Short-term exposure to impulse noise generated by five gunshots from the rifle kbk AKMS hasn't induced temporary threshold shift of hearing for chosen frequencies in soldiers using hearing protectors. Spectral analysis for chosen frequencies revealed that measurement reproducibility, stimuli level, and probe stability appeared to be comparable and repeatable.CONCLUSION: Our results show that the use of hearing protectors safeguarded against impulse noise.SIGNIFICANCE: The use of earmuffs is strongly recommended because they seem to sufficiently attenuate shooting noise."
"18552039","[The evaluation of usefullnes of hearing protectors while exposure to impulse noise].","INTRODUCTION: It is generally agreed that impulse noise that occurs mainly in industrial processes, military forces and recreational target practice und hunting is especially hazardous to the ear. From the physical point of view the phenomenon is defined as an acoustic pressure disturbance of short duration less than 1 sec and high intensity with the peak sound pressure levels greater than 100 dB SPL.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 80 subjects (160 ears) aged 19-23 with correct tympanic membrane and thresholds measured by pure tone audiometry less than 20 dB. There were divided into two groups: I comprised 40 recruit soldiers put to the shooting training and group II consisted of 40 recruit soldiers using hearing protectors during shooting. Transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) measurements were performed by ILO 292 Echoport Otodynamics device 3-5 min before shooting and then 2 min, 1, 2 and 3 hours respectively after shooting in both groups.RESULTS: It was found that the gunshot impulse noise from kbk AKMS rifle caused in group I temporary hearing threshold shift (TTS) for 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 kHz frequencies of 1.07; 0.96; 1.41; 0.88 and 1.25 dB SPL respectively. TTS turned out to be maximum at 4 and 5 kHz and minimum at 1 and 2 kHz. In group II the soldiers used ear-muffs post-exposure changes were not significant.CONCLUSIONS: Short-term impulse noise generated by the rifle gunshots induced threshold shift of hearing. The usage of hearing protectors should be highly recommended because most of them seem to sufficiently attenuate impulse noise from firearms should be highly recommended because most of them seem to sufficiently attenuate impulse noise from firearms."
"18363008","Effect of basic military training on hearing in the Singapore Armed Forces.","INTRODUCTION: In the military service, hearing is at risk through exposure to impulse noise from firing and detonations. This study aims at looking into the consequences of military training on hearing acuity, as it would be useful to confirm the effectiveness of the hearing conservation programme in the Singapore Armed Forces.METHODS: A self-controlled study of 118 Singapore military conscripts was carried out, using questionnaires administered by trained personnel and pure tone audiometric assessments performed for both ears. The questionnaire and audiometry were done at the start of basic military training (BMT), with follow-up audiometry done at the end of BMT and one year into vocational military training (VT).RESULTS: 33 military conscripts were excluded subsequently in latter phases of the study. Of the 85 remaining conscripts, 16.5 percent of the study population were found to have abnormal audiograms at the start of BMT. At the end of the BMT phase, the percentage of enlistees with abnormal audiograms was 9.4 percent. By the end of one year of VT, the percentage of enlistees with abnormal audiograms was still 9.4 percent. Analysis of the differences in number of enlistees with hearing loss was done with the McNemar's test, and was found to be statistically insignificant (p-value equals 0.238).CONCLUSION: The prevalence of 16.5 percent abnormal audiograms at the pre-BMT stage is probably related to unfamiliarity with the audiogram testing and/or &quot;temporary threshold shift&quot; effect. There was no significant difference in the number of enlistees with hearing loss upon enlistment and after one year of military training in this cohort of soldiers."
"19766602","Follow-up of latency and threshold shifts of auditory brainstem responses after single and interrupted acoustic trauma in guinea pig.","Thresholds of auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) are widely used to estimate the level of noise-induced hearing loss or the level of acquired resistance to acoustic trauma after repeated exposures, i.e., the &quot;toughening&quot; effect. Less is known about ABR latencies and their relation to threshold changes. Guinea pigs were exposed to a traumatic pure tone at 5 kHz, 120 dB SPL, as either single (2 h, 4 h) or repeated (1 h every 48 h, four times) sessions. Thresholds and latencies of ABRs were monitored up to 45 days following the acoustic trauma. We show that latencies are prolonged in the case of large temporary threshold shifts observed in the days following trauma. The latency shift decreases after several repeated exposures, then stabilizes, similar to thresholds, suggesting that the &quot;toughening&quot; effect also applies to latencies. Permanent latency shift is usually very small compared to the permanent threshold shift. This effect could produce a recovery in the ability to process auditory information through the precise timing of neuronal events. Our study indicates that when estimated at suprathreshold stimulation level (70 dB SPL), latency provides complementary information to the sole threshold."
"19643173","Glutathione S-transferase M1, T1, and P1 polymorphisms as susceptibility factors for noise-induced temporary threshold shift.","The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is thought to be part of the mechanism underlying noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Glutathione is an important cellular antioxidant that limits cell damage by ROS. We aimed to determine the effect of genetic polymorphisms of glutathione S-transferase (GST) T1, GSTM1, and GSTP1, on temporary threshold shift (TTS) in 58 noise-exposed male workers from a steel factory. The pre-shift hearing impairment at high frequency (HF, average of 3, 4, and 6kHz) was 30.7dB HL (S.D.=19.3). The amount of daily noise exposure was 83.0dBA (S.D.=5.0). Noise-induced TTS at HF by pure-tone audiometry (PTA) was related to the daily noise exposure (p&lt;0.05). Based on combinatory analysis, we found that individuals carrying all genotypes with GSTT1 null, GSTM1 null, and GSTP1 Ile(105)/Ile(105) were more susceptible to NIHL. These results suggest that pre-shift hearing impairment and daily noise exposure had impacts on TTS at HF by PTA. In addition, GST genetic polymorphisms may modify the susceptibility to noise-induced TTS."
"19597738","The effect of active sonar for the protection of moored and anchored warships on the human hearing.","This study wants to show the effects of active middle frequency sonar on a selected group of Italian Navy divers. Ten male divers with normal hearing were exposed to active sonar of the Italian Navy for more than 100 exposures, each of at least 1-h duration, in the course of 6 months. Before, at the end, and six months after the end of noise exposure, we performed pure-tone audiometry, Carhart test, Peyser test, thresholds of discomfort test (TDT), tympanometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), and auditory brainstem response (ABR). At the end of the noise exposure, the audiological tests showed a worsening of the mean air and bone audiometric thresholds at the 2,000 (1/10), 4,000 (7/10), and 8,000 Hz (6/10); a fail status of the TEOAE and DPOAE, which were previously present, in all the divers; temporary threshold shift, at the Peyser test, in 9/10 divers; discomfort for pulse tone presented at the TDT test, in all the divers; no post exposure significant differences at the Carhart and ABR tests, in any of the divers. Six months after the end of noise exposure, all the divers presented a complete recovery of their audio-vestibular functions. Our results show the temporary negative effects of repeated and lasting exposure to active sonar (Hull MF) on the divers; the last control demonstrate the absence of permanent noise-induced hearing loss in divers exposed to active sonar."
"20584863","Temporary threshold shifts at 1500 and 2000 Hz induced by loud voice signals communicated through earphones in the pinball industry.","To assess the risk of hearing loss among workers using earphones as communication devices at noisy worksites, we compared temporary threshold shifts (TTS) between ears on which workers wore earphones and ears on which no earphones were worn. We measured ambient noise and personal noise exposure as well as noise generated by and passed through earphones by applying frequency analysis at three pinball facilities during their hours of actual operation. We assessed hearing levels before and after a work shift (prework and postwork) of 54 workers by pure tone audiometry at six frequencies. The time-weighted averages for ambient noise and personal noise exposure exceeded 85 dB(A) and 90 dB(A), respectively. Overall sound pressure levels generated by and passing through earphones reached 109 dB(A). The one-third octave band spectrum of the earphone noise during the shift exceeded 90 dB(SPL) in the range of 315-2000 Hz. The number of ears demonstrating a TTS, defined as a shift of 10 dB or more in postwork over prework hearing thresholds, was significantly greater at 1500 and 2000 Hz among ears with earphones (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively) compared to those without. The reverse was observed at 4000 Hz for ears without earphones (P &lt; 0.01). Workers wearing earphones or headsets as communication devices in noisy environments are exposed to high risk of hearing loss, particularly at the frequencies of 1500 and 2000 Hz. Ideally, hearing conservation programs for such workers should account for potential hearing losses at frequencies of 2000 Hz or lower frequencies induced by amplified voice signals."
"22122960","Increased vitamin plasma levels in Swedish military personnel treated with nutrients prior to automatic weapon training.","Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a significant clinical, social, and economic issue. The development of novel therapeutic agents to reduce NIHL will potentially benefit multiple very large noise-exposed populations. Oxidative stress has been identified as a significant contributor to noise-induced sensory cell death and NIHL, and several antioxidant strategies have now been suggested for potential translation to human subjects. One such strategy is a combination of beta-carotene, vitamins C and E, and magnesium, which has shown promise for protection against NIHL in rodent models, and is being evaluated in a series of international human clinical trials using temporary (military gunfire, audio player use) and permanent (stamping factory, military airbase) threshold shift models (NCT00808470). The noise exposures used in the recently completed Swedish military gunfire study described in this report did not, on average, result in measurable changes in auditory function using conventional pure-tone thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) amplitudes as metrics. However, analysis of the plasma samples confirmed significant elevations in the bloodstream 2 hours after oral consumption of active clinical supplies, indicating the dose is realistic. The plasma outcomes are encouraging, but clinical acceptance of any novel therapeutic critically depends on demonstration that the agent reduces noise-induced threshold shift in randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective human clinical trials. Although this noise insult did not induce hearing loss, the trial design and study protocol can be applied to other populations exposed to different noise insults."
"21236610","Hearing loss after noise exposure.","The higher field strength magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) such as 3 Tesla (T) and above generates noise that has potential detrimental effects on the hearing. Temporary threshold shifts following MRI examination have been reported for MRI with lower field strength. Such effect, however, have not been reported so far for a 3T MRI. We report a case that exemplifies the possible detrimental effects of a 3 T MRI generated noise on the auditory system. Our patient underwent investigation of his chronic backache in a 3 T MRI unit and developed hearing loss and tinnitus post-MRI examination. Hearing assessment was done using pure tone audiogram, distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) and brainstem electrical response audiometry (BERA) which revealed a unilateral sensorineural hearing loss which recovered within 3 days. However the tinnitus persisted. This is possibly a case of temporary threshold shift following noise exposure. However a sudden sensorineural hearing loss remains the other possibility."
"23198571","[Audiometric findings of senior high school students belonging to a Kendo Club].","Between 1992 and 2010, we studied audiometric findings obtained from the annual hearing examination for senior high-school students who belonged to an active Kendo team. The subjects comprised 140 males and 88 females with ages between 15 and 18 years. The pure tone audiometry showed that 69 ears of 45 students (19.7%) had sensorineural hearing loss with the highest threshold shift at 2000 Hz, followed by 4000 Hz. Frequent audiometric patterns included a 2000 Hz-dip, a 4000 Hz-dip and a combined loss of 2000 and 4000 Hz. Some of these affected subjects had shown a completely normal audiogram at the previous examination. Moreover, small-dips with a depth less than 25 dB were found to be limited either at 2000 Hz or at 4000 Hz, suggesting early audiometric changes from a temporary or a permanent threshold shift caused by noise and/or head blows during Kendo practice. The incidence of such abnormal audiograms among this Kendo club members appears to be decreasing year by year owing to the annual check-ups over the 18-year study period, and student counseling regarding the possible adverse effect of Kendo on the inner ear function."
"22885407","Digital music exposure reliably induces temporary threshold shift in normal-hearing human subjects.","OBJECTIVES: One of the challenges for evaluating new otoprotective agents for potential benefit in human populations is the availability of an established clinical paradigm with real-world relevance. These studies were explicitly designed to develop a real-world digital music exposure that reliably induces temporary threshold shift (TTS) in normal-hearing human subjects.DESIGN: Thirty-three subjects participated in studies that measured effects of digital music player use on hearing. Subjects selected either rock or pop music, which was then presented at 93 to 95 (n = 10), 98 to 100 (n = 11), or 100 to 102 (n = 12) dBA in-ear exposure level for a period of 4 hr. Audiograms and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were measured before and after music exposure. Postmusic tests were initiated 15 min, 1 hr 15 min, 2 hr 15 min, and 3 hr 15 min after the exposure ended. Additional tests were conducted the following day and 1 week later.RESULTS: Changes in thresholds after the lowest-level exposure were difficult to distinguish from test-retest variability; however, TTS was reliably detected after higher levels of sound exposure. Changes in audiometric thresholds had a &quot;notch&quot; configuration, with the largest changes observed at 4 kHz (mean = 6.3 ± 3.9 dB; range = 0-14 dB). Recovery was largely complete within the first 4 hr postexposure, and all subjects showed complete recovery of both thresholds and DPOAE measures when tested 1 week postexposure.CONCLUSIONS: These data provide insight into the variability of TTS induced by music-player use in a healthy, normal-hearing, young adult population, with music playlist, level, and duration carefully controlled. These data confirm the likelihood of temporary changes in auditory function after digital music-player use. Such data are essential for the development of a human clinical trial protocol that provides a highly powered design for evaluating novel therapeutics in human clinical trials. Care must be taken to fully inform potential subjects in future TTS studies, including protective agent evaluations, that some noise exposures have resulted in neural degeneration in animal models, even when both audiometric thresholds and DPOAE levels returned to pre-exposure values."
"22619989","[Temporary hearing threshold shift in policemen after firearm training].","BACKGROUND: The paper involves exposure to noise of the State Police officers connected with the use of firearms. The noise generated by these weapons is of short duration and high intensity.METHODS: The research was carried out during the sessions of firearm training of State Police officers to assess exposure to noise.RESULTS: The values of the various investigations, both audiometric and phonometric, carried out made it possible to demonstrate a significant exposure and a temporary increase in the threshold, above the frequency of 6000 Hz.CONCLUSION: Even taking account of the abatement from use of headphones, an exposure was demonstrated that was above the statutory limits, as was confirmed by the temporary hearing threshold shift."
"23771423","Auditory risk assessment of college music students in jazz band-based instructional activity.","It is well-known that musicians are at risk for music-induced hearing loss, however, systematic evaluation of music exposure and its effects on the auditory system are still difficult to assess. The purpose of the study was to determine if college students in jazz band-based instructional activity are exposed to loud classroom noise and consequently exhibit acute but significant changes in basic auditory measures compared to non-music students in regular classroom sessions. For this we (1) measured and compared personal exposure levels of college students (n = 14) participating in a routine 50 min jazz ensemble-based instructional activity (experimental) to personal exposure levels of non-music students (n = 11) participating in a 50-min regular classroom activity (control), and (2) measured and compared pre- to post-auditory changes associated with these two types of classroom exposures. Results showed that the L eq (equivalent continuous noise level) generated during the 50 min jazz ensemble-based instructional activity ranged from 95 dBA to 105.8 dBA with a mean of 99.5 ± 2.5 dBA. In the regular classroom, the L eq ranged from 46.4 dBA to 67.4 dBA with a mean of 49.9 ± 10.6 dBA. Additionally, significant differences were observed in pre to post-auditory measures between the two groups. The experimental group showed a significant temporary threshold shift bilaterally at 4000 Hz (P &lt; 0.05), and a significant decrease in the amplitude of transient-evoked otoacoustic emission response in both ears (P &lt; 0.05) after exposure to the jazz ensemble-based instructional activity. No significant changes were found in the control group between pre- and post-exposure measures. This study quantified the noise exposure in jazz band-based practice sessions and its effects on basic auditory measures. Temporary, yet significant, auditory changes seen in music students place them at risk for hearing loss compared to their non-music cohorts."
"25549167","Short-term music-induced hearing loss after sound exposure to discotheque music: the effectiveness of a break in reducing temporary threshold shift.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a break in music exposure on temporary threshold shifts.DESIGN: A cross-over design where subjects are exposed to dance music for either two hours consecutively, or exposed to two hours of dance music with a one-hour break in between. Outcome measure was the change in hearing threshold, measured in 1-dB steps at different time points after ending the music.STUDY SAMPLE: Eighteen normal-hearing subjects participated in this study.RESULTS: Changes in pure-tone threshold were observed in both conditions and were similar, regardless of the break. Threshold shifts could be averaged for 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. The shift immediately after the ending of the music was 1.7 dB for right ears, and 3.4 dB for left ears. The difference between left and right ears was significant. One hour after the exposure, right ears were recovered to baseline conditions whereas left ears showed a small but clinically irrelevant remaining shift of approximately 1 dB.CONCLUSIONS: The advice to use chill-out zones is still valid, because this helps to reduce the duration to the exposure. This study does not provide evidence that a rest period gives an additional reduction of temporary threshold shifts."
"25205300","3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging noise in standard head and neck sequence does not cause temporary threshold shift in high frequency.","High acoustic noise level is one of the unavoidable side effects of 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A case of hearing loss after 3 T MRI has been reported in this institution and hence this study. The objective of this study was to determine whether temporary threshold shift (TTS) in high frequency hearing occurs in patients undergoing 3 T MRI scans of the head and neck. A total of 35 patients undergoing head and neck 3 T MRI for various clinical indications were tested with pure tone audiometry in different frequencies including high frequencies, before and after the MRI scan. Any threshold change from the recorded baseline of 10 dB was considered significant. All patients were fitted with foamed 3 M earplugs before the procedure following the safety guidelines for 3 T MRI. The mean time for MRI procedure was 1,672 s (range 1,040-2,810). The noise dose received by each patient amounted to an average of 3,906.29% (1,415-9,170%). The noise dose was derived from a normograph used by Occupational Noise Surveys. This was calculated using the nomograph of L eq, L EX, noise dose and time. There was no statistically significant difference between the hearing threshold before and after the MRI procedures for all the frequencies (paired t test, P &gt; 0.05). For patients using 3 M foamed earplugs, noise level generated by 3 T MRI during routine clinical sequence did not cause any TTS in high frequency hearing."
"25033789","Comparison of the effects of N-acetyl-cysteine and ginseng in prevention of noise induced hearing loss in male textile workers.","Previous studies revealed the role of antioxidant agents in prevention of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL). The aim of this study was to compare the protective effect of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and ginseng on protection of NIHL in textile workers exposed to continuous noise in daily working. In this study, 48 participants were randomly allocated to three groups; Group I received NAC 1200 mg/day, Group II received ginseng 200 mg/day, and Group III (control group) received no supplement. Pure tone audiometry and high frequency audiometry were performed preshift before and after 14 days (on day 15). Linear regression analysis results showed reduced noise-induced temporary threshold shift (TTS) for NAC and ginseng groups at 4, 6 and 16 kHz (P &lt; 0.001) in both ears. Furthermore, the protective effects were more prominent in NAC than ginseng. Our results show that NAC and ginseng can reduce noise induced TTS in workers exposed to occupational noise. Further studies are needed to prove antioxidants benefits in hearing conservation programs. "
"24708640","Using prophylactic antioxidants to prevent noise-induced hearing damage in young adults: a protocol for a double-blind, randomized controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: During leisure activities young people are often exposed to excessive noise levels resulting in an increase of noise-induced symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus and hyperacusis. Noise-induced tinnitus is often perceived after loud music exposure and provides an important marker for overexposure as a temporary threshold shift that is often not experienced by the individual itself. As oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of noise-induced hearing loss, the use of antioxidants to prevent hearing damage has recently become the subject of research.METHODS: This study proposes a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial to assess the effects of a prophylactic combination of N-acetylcysteine (600 mg) and magnesium (200 mg) prior to leisure noise exposure in young adults. The primary outcome measure is the tinnitus loudness scored by a visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary outcome measures are the differences in audiological measurements for the antioxidant treatments compared to placebo intake. Audiological testing comprising of pure tone audiometry including frequencies up to 16 kHz, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions and speech-in-noise testing will be performed prior to and within 7 hours after noise exposure. By use of a mixed effects statistical model, the effects of antioxidants compared to placebo intake will be assessed.DISCUSSION: As adolescents and young adults often do not use hearing protection while being exposed to loud music, the use of preventive antioxidant intake may provide a useful and harmless way to prevent noise-induced hearing damage in this population. Furthermore, when exposed to hazardous noise levels the protection provided by hearing protectors might not be sufficient to prevent hearing damage and antioxidants may provide additive otoprotective effects. Previous research mainly focused on occupational noise exposure. The present study provides a protocol to assess the usefulness of antioxidants during leisure noise activities.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The present protocol is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01727492."
"24564694","Temporary threshold shift after impulse-noise during video game play: laboratory data.","OBJECTIVE: Prevention of temporary threshold shift (TTS) after laboratory-based exposure to pure-tones, broadband noise, and narrowband noise signals has been achieved, but prevention of TTS under these experimental conditions may not accurately reflect protection against hearing loss following impulse noise. This study used a controlled laboratory-based TTS paradigm that incorporated impulsive stimuli into the exposure protocol; development of this model could provide a novel platform for assessing proposed therapeutics.DESIGN: Participants played a video game that delivered gunfire-like sound through headphones as part of a target practice game. Effects were measured using audiometric threshold evaluations and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). The sound level and number of impulses presented were sequentially increased throughout the study.STUDY SAMPLE: Participants were normal-hearing students at the University of Florida who provided written informed consent prior to participation.RESULTS: TTS was not reliably induced by any of the exposure conditions assessed here. However, there was significant individual variability, and a subset of subjects showed TTS under some exposure conditions.CONCLUSIONS: A subset of participants demonstrated reliable threshold shifts under some conditions. Additional experiments are needed to better understand and optimize stimulus parameters that influence TTS after simulated impulse noise."
"27540829","A faceoff with hazardous noise: Noise exposure and hearing threshold shifts of indoor hockey officials.","Noise exposure and hearing thresholds of indoor hockey officials of the Western States Hockey League were measured to assess the impact of hockey game noise on hearing sensitivity. Twenty-nine hockey officials who officiated the league in an arena in southeastern Wyoming in October, November, and December 2014 participated in the study. Personal noise dosimetry was conducted to determine if officials were exposed to an equivalent sound pressure level greater than 85 dBA. Hearing thresholds were measured before and after hockey games to determine if a 10 dB or greater temporary threshold shift in hearing occurred. Pure-tone audiometry was conducted in both ears at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz. All noise exposures were greater than 85 dBA, with a mean personal noise exposure level of 93 dBA (SD = 2.2), providing 17.7% (SD = 6.3) of the officials' daily noise dose according to the OSHA criteria. Hearing threshold shifts of 10 dB or greater were observed in 86.2% (25/29) of officials, with 36% (9/25) of those threshold shifts equaling 15 dB or greater. The largest proportion of hearing threshold shifts occurred at 4000 Hz, comprising 35.7% of right ear shifts and 31.8% of left ear shifts. The threshold shifts between the pre- and post-game audiometry were statistically significant in the left ear at 500 (p=.019), 2000 (p=.0009), 3000 (p&lt;.0001) and 4000 Hz (p=.0002), and in the right ear at 2000 (p=.0001), 3000 (p=.0001) and 4000 Hz (p&lt;.0001), based on Wilcoxon-ranked sum analysis. Although not statistically significant at alpha = 0.05, logistic regression indicated that with each increase of one dB of equivalent sound pressure measured from personal noise dosimetry, the odds of a = 10 dB TTS were increased in the left ear at 500 (OR=1.33, 95% CI 0.73-2.45), 3000 (OR=1.02, 95% CI 0.68-1.51), 4000 (OR=1.26, 95% CI 0.93-1.71) and 8000 Hz (OR=1.22, 95% CI 0.76-1.94) and in the right ear at 6000 (OR=1.03, 95% CI 0.14-7.84) and 8000 Hz (OR=1.29, 95% CI 0.12-13.83). These findings suggest that indoor hockey officials are exposed to hazardous levels of noise, experience temporary hearing loss after officiating games, and a hearing conservation program is warranted. Further temporary threshold shift research has the potential to identify officials of other sporting events that are at an increased risk of noise-induced hearing loss."

"27349914","Prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex vs. auditory brainstem response for hearing assessment.","The high prevalence of noise-induced and age-related hearing loss in the general population has warranted the use of animal models to study the etiology of these pathologies. Quick and accurate auditory threshold determination is a prerequisite for experimental manipulations targeting hearing loss in animal models. The standard auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurement is fairly quick and translational across species, but is limited by the need for anesthesia and a lack of perceptual assessment. The goal of this study was to develop a new method of hearing assessment utilizing prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle reflex, a commonly used tool that measures detection thresholds in awake animals, and can be performed on multiple animals simultaneously. We found that in control mice PPI audiometric functions are similar to both ABR and traditional operant conditioning audiograms. The hearing thresholds assessed with PPI audiometry in sound exposed mice were also similar to those detected by ABR thresholds one day after exposure. However, three months after exposure PPI threshold shifts were still evident at and near the frequency of exposure whereas ABR thresholds recovered to the pre-exposed level. In contrast, PPI audiometry and ABR wave one amplitudes detected similar losses. PPI audiometry provides a high throughput automated behavioral screening tool of hearing in awake animals. Overall, PPI audiometry and ABR assessments of the auditory system are robust techniques with distinct advantages and limitations, which when combined, can provide ample information about the functionality of the auditory system."

Hearing thresholds were measured by pure tone audiometry in two consecutive examinations (n = 226). STS was defined as an average change in hearing thresholds = + 10 dB at 2,000 Hz, 3,000 Hz, and 4,000 Hz in either ear. Determinants of STS were assessed through a questionnaire. The incidence of STS was 23.0%. Significant determinants of STS were the number of episodes of temporary threshold shifts (TTS) in the Navy, exposure to continuous loud noise during work on board, and the number of gun shots (in the Navy, hunting, and sports). This study indicated a significant association between noise exposure on board Navy vessels and development of STS. "

We investigated primary and secondary outcome measures: i) temporary threshold shift (TTS), defined as &gt;10 dB shift in pure tone air conduction thresholds and/or a decrement in distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) &gt;10 dB at two or more frequencies; ii) presence of new-onset otologic symptoms after exposure. Twenty adult subjects with normal hearing underwent a pre-exposure assessment (pure tone air conduction audiometry, tympanometry, DPOAEs and otologic symptoms questionnaire) followed by exposure to a 2-h movie with sound delivered through the HSS emitter followed by a post-exposure assessment. No TTS or new-onset otological symptoms were identified. HSS demonstrates excellent safety in normal hearing subjects under normal use conditions. "
"28716314","Safety and efficacy of ebselen for the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial.","BACKGROUND: Noise-induced hearing loss is a leading cause of occupational and recreational injury and disease, and a major determinant of age-related hearing loss. No therapeutic agent has been approved for the prevention or treatment of this disorder. In animal models, glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) activity is reduced after acute noise exposure. Ebselen, a novel GPx1 mimic, has been shown to reduce both temporary and permanent noise-induced hearing loss in preclinical studies. We assessed the safety and efficacy of ebselen for the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss in young adults in a phase 2 clinical trial.METHODS: In this single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial, healthy adults aged 18-31 years were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) at the University of Florida (Gainsville, FL, USA) to receive ebselen 200 mg, 400 mg, or 600 mg, or placebo orally twice daily for 4 days, beginning 2 days before a calibrated sound challenge (4 h of pre-recorded music delivered by insert earphones). Randomisation was done with an allocation sequence generated by an independent third party. The primary outcome was mean temporary threshold shift (TTS) at 4 kHz measured 15 min after the calibrated sound challenge by pure tone audiometry; a reduction of 50% in an ebselen dose group compared with the placebo group was judged to be clinically relevant. All participants who received the calibrated sound challenge and at least one dose of study drug were included in the efficacy analysis. All randomly assigned patients were included in the safety analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01444846.FINDINGS: Between Jan 11, 2013, and March 24, 2014, 83 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive ebselen 200 mg (n=22), 400 mg (n=20), or 600 mg (n=21), or placebo (n=20). Two participants in the 200 mg ebselen group were discontinued from the study before the calibrated sound challenge because they no longer met the inclusion criteria; these participants were excluded from the efficacy analysis. Mean TTS at 4 kHz was 1·32 dB (SE 0·91) in the 400 mg ebselen group compared with 4·07 dB (0·90) in the placebo group, representing a significant reduction of 68% (difference -2·75 dB, 95% CI -4·54 to -0·97; p=0·0025). Compared with placebo, TTS at 4 kHz was non-significantly reduced by 21% in the 200 mg ebselen group (3·23 dB [SE 0·91] vs 4·07 dB [0·90] in the placebo group; difference -0·84 dB, 95% CI -2·63 to 0·94; p=0·3542) and by 7% in the 600 mg ebselen group (3·81 dB [0·90] vs 4·07 dB [0·90] in the placebo group; difference -0·27, 95% CI -2·03 to 1·50; p=0·7659). Ebselen treatment was well tolerated across all doses and no significant differences were seen in any haematological, serum chemistry, or radiological assessments between the ebselen groups and the placebo group.INTERPRETATION: Treatment with ebselen was safe and effective at a dose of 400 mg twice daily in preventing a noise-induced TTS. These data lend support to a role of GPx1 activity in acute noise-induced hearing loss.FUNDING: Sound Pharmaceuticals."
