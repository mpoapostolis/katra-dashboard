"11126936","Specificity of auditory implicit and explicit memory: is perceptual priming for environmental sounds exemplar specific?","Previous research (Stuart &amp; Jones, 1995) has suggested that identification of environmental sounds may be mediated by abstract sound recognition units. This article reports the results of four repetition priming experiments that find evidence to the contrary. Participants attempted to identify environmental sounds from the initial sound stems (Experiments 1 and 2) or when the sounds were embedded in white noise (Experiments 3 and 4). Repetition of an identical exemplar sound led to more priming than did exposure to a different exemplar, provided that the perceptual difference between the two different exemplars was sufficiently large. Such an exemplar specificity effect was independent of the depth of prior encoding. A similar exemplar specificity effect was also found in explicit stem-cued recall (Experiments 1 and 2) and recognition (Experiment 3). Depth of encoding dissociated performance on tests of repetition priming and explicit memory. These results suggest that a significant amount of specific information is remembered, both implicitly and explicitly, to characterize individual exemplars of a sound category."
"10810771","Communicative ability in an audiological perspective. Theory and application to post-secondary school students.","The underlying assumption in the present study is that the individual's speech and hearing communicative ability is composed of three components, each corresponding to different functional systems of the brain: afferent functions (A) represent the auditory activity and sound perception largely corresponding to activity in the ascending auditory pathways. The central functions (C) include cortical auditory and language abilities controlled in parts of the left temporal lobe and subcortical centres. The efferent functions (E) consist of speech motor processes and articulation. A test battery of 20 tests measuring several aspects of afferent, central and efferent functions was applied to 11 hearing-impaired post-secondary school students and several control groups. All data were normalized with the normal materials as references. Individual communicative profiles were obtained from these primary data, which consisted of audiometric tests (tone and speech audiometry, impedance tests, brainstem response audiometry and phase audiometry), sound environmental tests with hearing aids (directional speech-in-noise, word localization, sound environment identification test), and language tests (reading tests, prosody, auditory memory and recall, phonology and articulation). Since the central functions cannot truly and directly be determined in hearing-imparied subjects, they were assessed under optimal listening conditions. Furthermore, central functions were estimated according to three different models: distributive, parallel model (model 1), multiplicative, serial model (model 2) and compensatory model (model 3). On the basis of these models, a three-component description of the communicative ability consisting of A,C and E functions was obtained. It was found that C and E functions were largely independent of the adult afferent functions, but C functions were negatively correctly to hearing in childhood. A preliminary comparison between the tests and a comparison between the models was performed by predicting benefit of hearing aid. Model 3 gave the best prediction. Beyond the three-component A,C, and E characterization of the students, a total communicative ability score could be calculated giving values from 37% to 79% of the normal mean. On the basis of the conceptual and statistical analyses, the test battery could be reduced to include tone 0-12 years, tone adults, word localization test (afferent); word chain, lecture test (central), articulatory test (efferent) and audiovisual test. The simple algorithm of adding the normalized loss of afferent (peripheral) function to the normalized results of the acoustic central tests seems to be promising for isolation for the central auditory capacity even in cases with peripheral impairment. It is concluded that a wider perspective is desirable in the diagnostic evaluation of the hearing-impaired individual in order to understand his communicative abilities and form a cornerstone in the planning of rehabilitation in conjunction with social and psychological factors."
"11678172","Long-term objective and subjective audiologic consequences of closed head injury.","During a period of 5 years, a total of 47 patients, 16-60 years of age, with major closed head injury (CHI) were admitted to 2 Swedish medical centres. Seven to 11 years after injury, 25 of them (mean age 40.8 years; range 25-59 years) were evaluated using peripheral and central auditory tests, and most of them also completed 2 questionnaires concerning self-assessed hearing ability and quality of life. Twenty-two patients did not participate in the long-term follow-up tests: 15 were excluded for medical reasons and 4 did not wish to participate; an additional 2 were impossible to trace and 1 had died. As many as 68% of patients (17/25) demonstrated abnormalities on 1 or more of the audiometric tests, 14 on pure-tone audiometry (p &lt; 0.02) and/or central audiometric tests (3 on central tests only and 2 on pure-tone audiometry only). Four out of six patients with available early post-traumatic audiograms showed a significant progressive deterioration. As a group, their assessments of hearing ability and quality of life were equal to or better than those of the controls. These results may indicate that a higher priority should be given to obtaining an early audiologic evaluation of every CHI patient than is the rule today. The impact of post-traumatic progress and central lesions on social hearing at an advanced age is highlighted."
"11519579","Spatial unmasking of nearby speech sources in a simulated anechoic environment.","Spatial unmasking of speech has traditionally been studied with target and masker at the same, relatively large distance. The present study investigated spatial unmasking for configurations in which the simulated sources varied in azimuth and could be either near or far from the head. Target sentences and speech-shaped noise maskers were simulated over headphones using head-related transfer functions derived from a spherical-head model. Speech reception thresholds were measured adaptively, varying target level while keeping the masker level constant at the &quot;better&quot; ear. Results demonstrate that small positional changes can result in very large changes in speech intelligibility when sources are near the listener as a result of large changes in the overall level of the stimuli reaching the ears. In addition, the difference in the target-to-masker ratios at the two ears can be substantially larger for nearby sources than for relatively distant sources. Predictions from an existing model of binaural speech intelligibility are in good agreement with results from all conditions comparable to those that have been tested previously. However, small but important deviations between the measured and predicted results are observed for other spatial configurations, suggesting that current theories do not accurately account for speech intelligibility for some of the novel spatial configurations tested."
"12002867","Assessing auditory distance perception using virtual acoustics.","In most naturally occurring situations, multiple acoustic properties of the sound reaching a listener's ears change as sound source distance changes. Because many of these acoustic properties, or cues, can be confounded with variation in the acoustic properties of the source and the environment, the perceptual processes subserving distance localization likely combine and weight multiple cues in order to produce stable estimates of sound source distance. Here, this cue-weighting process is examined psychophysically, using a method of virtual acoustics that allows precise measurement and control of the acoustic cues thought to be salient for distance perception in a representative large-room environment. Though listeners' judgments of sound source distance are found to consistently and exponentially underestimate true distance, the perceptual weight assigned to two primary distance cues (intensity and direct-to-reverberant energy ratio) varies substantially as a function of both sound source type (noise and speech) and angular position (0 degrees and 90 degrees relative to the median plane). These results suggest that the cue-weighting process is flexible, and able to adapt to individual distance cues that vary as a result of source properties and environmental conditions."
"14665814","Noise exposure and hearing loss in agriculture: a survey of farmers and farm workers in the Southland region of New Zealand.","Farmers are known to be exposed to intermittent intense noise from a variety of sources, but long-term exposure and the resulting risk of hearing loss have not been well characterized. We studied a cross-sectional random sample of farms on which agricultural workers completed an audiometric test and questionnaire, and performed noise dosimetry on a subsample. Sixty-five percent of farms and a total of 586 workers participated. Noise on the subsample of 60 farms lay in a range between 84.8 to 86.8 dB(A) and hearing losses were consistent with this level of exposure. Age, driving tractors without cabs, and working with metal were important risk factors. Reported compliance with hearing protection was higher than that actually observed. The majority of farmers have a moderate risk of hearing loss, but a significant minority is at high risk. Elimination and isolation of noise sources are the control methods of choice, and if residual hearing protection is required, compliance must be improved."
"14570238","King-Kopetzky syndrome in the light of an ecological conceptual framework.","The principal symptom of subjects suffering from King-Kopetzky syndrome is a perceived difficulty in recognizing and understanding speech in noisy backgrounds. For some patients, minor disturbances in auditory function, e.g. a deteriorated signal-to-noise ratio for speech, can be demonstrated; for others, all measurements of hearing are normal. A conceptual framework developed for the analysis of communication disorders is applied to King-Kopetzky syndrome in the present article. The usefulness of the framework is evaluated, and an extended system for the analysis of King-Kopetzky syndrome patients is suggested. It is emphasized that changes in demands resulting from external conditions and altered perception and evaluation of the conditions may generate the symptoms. A change in the subjects' desired self-image (preferendum) and a change in social role, new, unfamiliar vocabulary, as well as minor dysfunctions in peripheral and central auditory processing, might generate the characteristic features of the syndrome. The framework is related to the current literature, and arguments for the usefulness of the framework in the planning of support and rehabilitation are presented. Several new questions are generated for further analysis of King-Kopetzky syndrome."
"14514220","Auditory and behavioral responses of California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) to single underwater impulses from an arc-gap transducer.","A behavioral response paradigm was used to measure underwater hearing thresholds in two California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) before and after exposure to underwater impulses from an arc-gap transducer. Preexposure and postexposure hearing thresholds were compared to determine if the subjects experienced temporary shifts in their masked hearing thresholds (MTTS). Hearing thresholds were measured at 1 and 10 kHz. Exposures consisted of single underwater impulses produced by an arc-gap transducer referred to as a &quot;pulsed power device&quot; (PPD). The electrical charge of the PPD was varied from 1.32 to 2.77 kJ; the distance between the subject and the PPD was varied over the range 3.4 to 25 m. No MTTS was observed in either subject at the highest received levels: peak pressures of approximately 6.8 and 14 kPa, rms pressures of approximately 178 and 183 dB re: 1 microPa, and total energy fluxes of 161 and 163 dB re: 1 microPa2s for the two subjects. Behavioral reactions to the tests were observed in both subjects. These reactions primarily consisted of temporary avoidance of the site where exposure to the PPD impulse had previously occurred."
"12921383","Polish version of standardized noise reaction questions for community noise surveys.","OBJECTIVES: This article presents the Polish version of two standardized noise reaction questions for community noise surveys. An internationally comparable noise reaction measure for social surveys was published by Fields et al. as a result of work performed by the Community Response to Noise Team of the International Commission on the Biological Effects of Noise. This measure consists of two recommended noise reaction questions: a 5-point verbal scale question and a 0-10-point numeric scale question.METHODS: The Polish words for a 5-point noise annoyance verbal scale were selected by respondents from a group of 21 potential adverbs following the method described by Fields et al. The same standardized empirical study protocol was used to select annoyance scale words (a 5-point verbal scale question) for the nine different languages.RESULTS: The following words for a 5-point noise annoyance scale were obtained: not at all, a little, rather, substantially, extremely annoying.CONCLUSIONS: The Polish version of the scale described in this paper has international counterparts. It means that our data expand the world database on human reactions to noise in different communities and become more comparable with the data from other countries."
"12921130","Noise-induced hearing loss in snorers and their bed partners.","OBJECTIVE: As habitual snoring affects a large percentage of the population and is associated with various medical and social complications, we examined whether loud snoring is also associated with noise-induced hearing loss for the snorers and/or their bed partners.PATIENT SELECTION: Healthy adults between the ages of 35 and 55 years with subjective symptoms of severe snoring were screened to exclude those with a past history of noise exposure (e.g., factory workers, army personnel), use of ototoxic medications, and previously diagnosed hearing disorder.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Behavioural audiograms and otoacoustic emission testing were used to evaluate the subjects' hearing.RESULTS: Although all of the snorers did not demonstrate consistent hearing loss patterns, all four bed partners of snorers in our study demonstrated a unilateral high-frequency pattern of hearing loss consistent with noise-induced hearing loss. Furthermore, the affected ear in every case was the one that was claimed to be chronically exposed to snoring noise.CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that there may be a relationship between snoring and noise-induced hearing loss in the bed partners of chronic snorers. Further investigation of this association may enable the population at risk to identify early hearing loss in order that appropriate management of noise exposure and snoring can be recommended, including preventive measures and medical and surgical therapies."
"12723484","[Utility and limitations of speech audiometry testing in the detection of occupational noise-induced hearing loss: a comparative study in two groups in the hospital setting].","OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is the evaluation of the calculation of 100% intelligibility threshold and noise resistance index as a monitoring test in populations exposed to noise in their work environment.METHOD: This is a retrospective exposed-unexposed study as the exposure to the risk factors took place before the survey. The exposed subjects were chosen in principle on sonometric criteria and the unexposed subjects among employees whom we believe were not exposed. The exploration method included history taking, clinical examination, free field audiometry and speech audiometry with background noise.RESULTS: The exposed population has a 100% intelligibility threshold on average equal to 29.69 dB, significantly higher than in the unexposed population where it is calculated at 25.30 dB (p = 0.07). The noise resistance index varies with age (p = 0.04).CONCLUSION: Our study shows the existence of a significant hearing difference between two populations with different noise exposure. It demonstrates a relationship between a hearing loss risk factor such as noise and the occurrence of the &quot;professional hearing loss&quot; disorder. The calculation of the 100% intelligibility index and the noise resistance index advantageously complements tonal audiometry. These procedures provide a better approach to the social impact of hearing loss but were not useful in the detection of hearing loss."
"12689366","The contribution of social noise to tinnitus in young people - a preliminary report.","In our study of the Hearing in Young Adults (HIYA) aged 18-25 years, there appeared to be little effect of social noise on hearing thresholds (Smith et al. 1998). There was however, a threefold increase in the reports of tinnitus in those subjects with significant social noise exposure (&gt;/=97 dB NIL). No other abnormality was found of hearing function for those who were exposed to the most social noise. In an attempt to investigate this further we invited a sub-sample of those tested in the earlier phase of the study, to conduct further examinations of their hearing function. The three groups eventually consisted of those in the most social noise group who reported tinnitus (n=15) and those who did not (n=15), plus a group of people who had no social noise exposure but who reported tinnitus (n=8). All the groups were retested for their hearing thresholds, using standard audiometry and also the Audioscan technique to look for notches in the audiogram. Speech tests were carried out using an adaptive FAAF test. Transient-evoked oto-acoustic emissions were measured and also suppressed with a contralateral broad-band noise. Some evidence has been found to suggest that those young people who reported tinnitus are affected by social noise exposure, in terms of pure tone thresholds, speech tests, oto-acoustic emissions and reported hearing problems. Lessons can be drawn from our attempt to follow up this interesting population. First, the population is highly mobile and follow-up is difficult. Second, the presumed noise exposure was often not appropriate because even after a year it was possible for several individuals with insignificant social noise to move into the group with significant social noise exposure. Third, there is a need for a larger multi-centre study to look at the effect of social noise in more detail using a common protocol. The results of our study will be very useful in calculating the numbers needed in such a multi-centre study."
"15592858","Detecting components of hearing aid fitting using a self-assessment-inventory.","The evaluation of hearing-aid fitting includes numerous assessments such as electro- and psychoacoustic tests. The subjective estimation of the hearing aid user can be elicited with self-assessment inventories encompassing various parameters, e.g., benefit, satisfaction and usage. A questionnaire comprising 11 domains (disability, handicap, frequency and significance of the listening situation, importance of the hearing aid, expectation, demand, aided performance, benefit, satisfaction and usage) within three different conditions (speech in quiet and in noise and listening to sounds) was used to detect components underlying hearing aid fitting. The data show a three-factor structure (situation-, restriction- and aid-related variables) independent from the conditions. Usage depends on all of the three factors. Disability and handicap reveal the highest values for speech in noise, whereas the aid-related factor shows the lowest values for this condition. Global satisfaction with the hearing aid is significantly correlated with the aid-related factor, but independent from the restriction of hearing. The aid-related factor is positively influenced by the amount of social activity because more active persons report higher benefit and satisfaction for all listening conditions. Age does not exhibit a significant relationship to one of the components. Basically, all correlation coefficients are only intermediate, revealing that inter-individual differences of the patients are rather high. The data indicate that extra-audiological factors might also play an important role in the success of hearing aid fitting."
"15289584","Noise-induced hearing loss and hearing conservation in mining.","BACKGROUND: Noise exposure is prevalent in mining, and as the prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss has not changed much in the past two decades, hearing conservation is an important issue.OBJECTIVES: To review the literature and highlight important developments in the field.METHODS: A review of the literature using OVID as the primary search engine, using the search terms as: noise, occupational; hearing loss, noise induced; ear protective devices; and mining.RESULTS: A total of 66 articles were found, but only 11 were in the English language and few were published in the past 10 years. This is disappointing, because neither noise exposure nor the consequent risk of noise-induced hearing loss seems to have changed much in the past 20 years. Noise is, however, a generic hazard, and this article reviews current best practice in prevention."
"15258659","Communication by unvoiced speech: the role of whispering.","Most studies on whispering deal with its production and perception, neglecting its communicative role. I have focused on this, especially some social and psychobiological objectives. I have combined a general inquiry into the use of unvoiced speech with stimulus-response experiments on particular signal properties. (1) Analyses of answers to queries revealed that judgments about whispering depend on the social contexts. In the private domain it plays a clearly positive role, but in the public domain it is more problematical. Two causative factors were identified as relevant: (a) an 'ingroup' function of whispering which could induce negative 'outgroup' effects in co-listeners, and (b) a psychobiological component of whispering which could affect the auditory vigilance of co-listeners who were not addressed personally by the signaling, but often wanted to understand a whispered message. (2) Analyses of experimental data confirmed the relevance of these factors. Additionally, they showed that unvoiced speech has a limited transmission range, and is easily masked by background noise. Taken together, the results suggest that whispering is explained best as a close-distance signal adapted for private use among partners."
"14974628","Self-reported hearing difficulty and hearing impairment in Japanese people living in a community.","Nine hundred and eighteen people aged 40 years and over were examined to assess the relationship between self-reported hearing difficulty and hearing impairment at 1 kHz and 4kHz during annual health check-ups. After adjustment for potential confounding factors of self-reported hearing difficulty such as age, sex, noise exposure, ear disease and tinnitus. the odds ratios for self-reported hearing difficulty at 1 kHz compared with a hearing threshold of 30 dB were 1.74. 3.37 and 4.97 for hearing thresholds of 40 dB, 50 dB, and over 50 dB, respectively (p-value for trend = 0.003). At 4 kHz, the respective odds ratios for self-reported hearing difficulty were 1.53, 2.59 and 1.83 (p-value for trend = 0.012). These results suggest that self-reported hearing difficulty is closely associated with the severity of hearing impairment at 1 kHz and 4 kHz in a community-residing population and that people with hearing impairment at 1 kHz would be more sensitive to their hearing difficulty than those with hearing impairment at 4 kHz."
"14759029","Performance of time- and frequency-domain binaural beamformers based on recorded signals from real rooms.","Extraction of a target sound source amidst multiple interfering sound sources is difficult when there are fewer sensors than sources, as is the case for human listeners in the classic cocktail-party situation. This study compares the signal extraction performance of five algorithms using recordings of speech sources made with three different two-microphone arrays in three rooms of varying reverberation time. Test signals, consisting of two to five speech sources, were constructed for each room and array. The signals were processed with each algorithm, and the signal extraction performance was quantified by calculating the signal-to-noise ratio of the output. A frequency-domain minimum-variance distortionless-response beamformer outperformed the time-domain based Frost beamformer and generalized sidelobe canceler for all tests with two or more interfering sound sources, and performed comparably or better than the time-domain algorithms for tests with one interfering sound source. The frequency-domain minimum-variance algorithm offered performance comparable to that of the Peissig-Kollmeier binaural frequency-domain algorithm, but with much less distortion of the target signal. Comparisons were also made to a simple beamformer. In addition, computer simulations illustrate that, when processing speech signals, the chosen implementation of the frequency-domain minimum-variance technique adapts more quickly and accurately than time-domain techniques."
"15704422","Across-ear interference from parametrically degraded synthetic speech signals in a dichotic cocktail-party listening task.","Recent results have shown that listeners attending to the quieter of two speech signals in one ear (the target ear) are highly susceptible to interference from normal or time-reversed speech signals presented in the unattended ear. However, speech-shaped noise signals have little impact on the segregation of speech in the opposite ear. This suggests that there is a fundamental difference between the across-ear interference effects of speech and nonspeech signals. In this experiment, the intelligibility and contralateral-ear masking characteristics of three synthetic speech signals with parametrically adjustable speech-like properties were examined: (1) a modulated noise-band (MNB) speech signal composed of fixed-frequency bands of envelope-modulated noise; (2) a modulated sine-band (MSB) speech signal composed of fixed-frequency amplitude-modulated sinewaves; and (3) a &quot;sinewave speech&quot; signal composed of sine waves tracking the first four formants of speech. In all three cases, a systematic decrease in performance in the two-talker target-ear listening task was found as the number of bands in the contralateral speech-like masker increased. These results suggest that speech-like fluctuations in the spectral envelope of a signal play an important role in determining the amount of across-ear interference that a signal will produce in a dichotic cocktail-party listening task."
"15700442","Psychoacoustic quantification of mechanical heart valve noise.","BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Mechanical heart valves produce short clicking sounds during closure. These closing sounds are annoying for some patients and their partners by causing sleeping disorders or social embarrassment. Various methods for measuring the sounds have been developed both in vitro and in vivo using calculation of A-weighted sound pressure level or loudness according to ISO 532 B. The study aim was to evaluate the relevance of different psychoacoustic parameters in the evaluation of closing sounds.METHODS: Closing sounds were recorded from patients with ATS valves (n = 13), On-X valves (n = 18) and St. Jude Medical heart valve prostheses (n = 16). The sounds were recorded 5 cm above the chest of patients in a supine position, in a sound-insulated chamber. The mean peak values of loudness and sharpness were calculated and used to determine the psychoacoustic annoyance using a modification of the Widmann formula. This was verified by a listening test for ranking closing sounds of different level and sharpness by annoyance.RESULTS: There was no statistically significant independence between loudness difference or psychoacoustic annoyance difference and agreement among the test persons. For the valves, loudness ranged from 0.07 to 2.57 sone, and the psychoacoustic annoyance from 0.1 to 5.4.CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that both sharpness and loudness have a significant influence on annoyance from closing sounds from mechanical heart valves, and indicated that the substantial variation in the parameters may be due to individual patient physiology."
"15658698","The role of noise sensitivity in the noise-response relation: a comparison of three international airport studies.","In order to examine the role of noise sensitivity in response to environmental noise, this paper presents detailed comparisons of socio-acoustic studies conducted around international airports in Amsterdam, Sydney, and London. Earlier findings that noise sensitivity moderates the effect of noise on annoyance were examined to see if they could be replicated in each of the datasets, independent of the technique of measuring noise sensitivity. The relation between exposure to aircraft noise and noise annoyance was studied separately for groups of individuals with low, medium, and high noise sensitivity, with statistical adjustment for relevant confounders. Results support the previous findings that noise sensitivity is an independent predictor of annoyance and adds to the prediction of noise annoyance afforded by noise exposure level by up to 26% of explained variance. There is no evidence of a moderating effect, whereby the covariation between noise exposure level and annoyance is weak for people who score at the extreme high or low end of the sensitivity scale, and strong for people who score in the middle of the sensitivity scale. Generally, noise sensitivity appears to increase annoyance independently of the level of noise exposure after adjustment for relevant confounders. These findings were consistent across the three datasets."
"15658697","Perception and annoyance due to wind turbine noise--a dose-response relationship.","Installed global wind power increased by 26% during 2003, with U.S and Europe accounting for 90% of the cumulative capacity. Little is known about wind turbines' impact on people living in their vicinity. The aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of annoyance due to wind turbine noise and to study dose-response relationships. Interrelationships between noise annoyance and sound characteristics, as well as the influence of subjective variables such as attitude and noise sensitivity, were also assessed. A cross-sectional study was performed in Sweden in 2000. Responses were obtained through questionnaires (n = 351; response rate 68.4%), and doses were calculated as A-weighted sound pressure levels for each respondent. A statistically significant dose-response relationship was found, showing higher proportion of people reporting perception and annoyance than expected from the present dose-response relationships for transportation noise. The unexpected high proportion of annoyance could be due to visual interference, influencing noise annoyance, as well as the presence of intrusive sound characteristics. The respondents' attitude to the visual impact of wind turbines on the landscape scenery was found to influence noise annoyance."

They were divided in two age-matched groups and with tonal audiometric values within the acceptable limits: 37 were exposed to occupational noise and 37 were not exposed.RESULTS: Risk estimates (Odds Ratio) of absent DPOAE was 12 fold higher for the group exposed to occupational noise (CI 95% 3.1-45.9), in the frequencies of 3. 4 and 6 kHz.CONCLUSION: DPOAE may be useful in the identification of physiopathological hearing alterations caused by exposure to occupational noise, even in individuals with tonal audiometric responses within acceptable limits."
"16850905","Hypertension and hearing impairment in workers of iron and steel industry.","The objectives of the present study were to study the (i) prevalence of hypertension and hearing impairment in iron and steel industry workers, (ii) association between hypertension and hearing impairment, (iii) association between hypertension and hearing impairment, with duration of exposure, and (iv) correlation between levels of sound and noise induced health problems viz. hypertension and hearing impairment in a cross sectional study involving Workers working in iron and steel industry at Nagpur. Of a total of 804 workers, 770 workers participated in the study. There were five sections in the factory; Steel melting section (SMS), rolling mill section (RMS), quality control department (QCD), maintenance department (MD) and administration department (AD). Workers working in SMS, RMS, &amp; QCD formed a continuously exposed group (CEG); workers of MD and AD formed intermittently exposed group (IEG). Workers were interviewed, examined and information was collected in a pre-tested pro-forma. Blood pressure was measured, and tuning fork tests were done to assess hearing ability. Prevalence of hypertension among CEG (25.51%) was significantly higher than IEG (14.05%). (X2-14.28, df-1, P&lt;0.001). There was positive association between duration of exposure and prevalence of hypertension. The prevalence of hearing impairment was significantly more in CEG (20.5%) as compared to IEG (8.91%). (X2-11.69, df-1, P&lt;0.001). Occurrence of hearing impairment was also directly proportional to the duration of exposure. The correlation between level of sound exposure and hearing impairment was found to be significant (r=0.98; P&lt;0.05), the correlation between level of sound and hypertension was found to be statistically insignificant (r=0.84; P&gt;0.05). The results of the present study indicate that hypertension and hearing impairment are commoner in workers continuously exposed to high levels of occupational noise."
"16716004","Field study to explore possible effects of styrene on auditory function in exposed workers.","OBJECTIVES: We conducted this study to examine, whether occupational styrene exposures are associated with reduced hearing ability.METHODS: The auditory function was investigated by pure tone audiometry and registration of transitory evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) in 32 workers of a fibre-reinforced plastic boat building factory. Sixteen subjects were laminators (mean age: 41 yr (SD: 8)) and therefore regularly exposed to styrene with mean duration of exposure to styrene of 7.5 yr (SD 5.0). The tests were applied to a reference group of 16 workers (mean age: 39 yr (SD: 8)) who were not directly exposed to styrene but had a similar noise exposure.RESULTS: A few and isolated correlations between the parameters of hearing acuity and exposure indices, such as current internal styrene exposures (sum of MA and PGA) and duration of styrene exposure, were statistically significant, but no consistent association was found.CONCLUSION: The results of this study do not support the assumption of an ototoxic effect of chronic styrene exposure in workers."

A hundred and three adults with normal hearing, male and female, with ages varying from 18 to 45 years were divided in three groups: G1 with 41 adults exposed to noise and who used AIPE; G2 with 32 adults exposed to noise and who did not use AIPE; G3 with 30 adults who were not exposed to noise. Participants were submitted to audiologic evaluation, including the analysis of the acoustic reflex level (ARL) and discomfort level (DL) at the frequencies of 500 HZ, 1000Hz, 2000Hz, 3000Hz, 4000Hz and WN. For the statistical analysis the tests of Mann Whitney, Wilcoxon and Kruskal, with significance levels of 5%, were used.RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was identified for the ARL between the three groups, with mean values ranging from 93 to 103dBHL; the ARL was significantly smaller than the DL, with the mean values of DL varying from 111 to 119 dBHL for G1, from 113 to 120dBHL for G2 and from 106 to 114dBHL for G3; the DL is higher in individuals of G1 followed by individuals of G2 and G3.CONCLUSION: The exposure to noise does not determine changes in the behavior of the ARL; the DL rises with the exposure to occupational noise; the DL is higher than the ARL in 10 to 25dB."
"17664866","The complexity of age-related hearing impairment: contributing environmental and genetic factors.","Age-related hearing impairment (ARHI) is the most common sensory impairment seen in the elderly. It is a complex disorder, with both environmental as well as genetic factors contributing to the impairment. The involvement of several environmental factors has been partially elucidated. A first step towards the identification of the genetic factors has been made, which will result in the identification of susceptibility genes, and will provide possible targets for the future treatment and/or prevention of ARHI. This paper aims to give a broad overview of the scientific findings related to ARHI, focusing mainly on environmental and genetic data in humans and in animal models. In addition, methods for the identification of contributing genetic factors as well as possible future therapeutic strategies are discussed."
"17564499","Auditory cortical detection and discrimination correlates with communicative significance.","Plasticity studies suggest that behavioral relevance can change the cortical processing of trained or conditioned sensory stimuli. However, whether this occurs in the context of natural communication, where stimulus significance is acquired through social interaction, has not been well investigated, perhaps because neural responses to species-specific vocalizations can be difficult to interpret within a systematic framework. The ultrasonic communication system between isolated mouse pups and adult females that either do or do not recognize the calls' significance provides an opportunity to explore this issue. We applied an information-based analysis to multi- and single unit data collected from anesthetized mothers and pup-naïve females to quantify how the communicative significance of pup calls affects their encoding in the auditory cortex. The timing and magnitude of information that cortical responses convey (at a 2-ms resolution) for pup call detection and discrimination was significantly improved in mothers compared to naïve females, most likely because of changes in call frequency encoding. This was not the case for a non-natural sound ensemble outside the mouse vocalization repertoire. The results demonstrate that a sensory cortical change in the timing code for communication sounds is correlated with the vocalizations' behavioral relevance, potentially enhancing functional processing by improving its signal to noise ratio."
"19025035","Psychoacoustic tests for central auditory processing: normative data.","The comprehension of spoken language is based on the analysis of complex acoustic signals by the central auditory system, Direct relationships between gradual, spectrotemporal modifications of speech sounds and the impairment of the comprehension of such altered sounds have been found in many psychophysical studies. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that deficits in the understanding of speech seen in patients with acquired brain lesions may, to a certain degree, result from impaired central processing of acoustic signals. We report normative data collected from 94 young normal-hearing subjects on a battery of psychoacoustic tests designed to evaluate signal processing at different levels of the central auditory system. Monaural pure tone thresholds were used to evaluate the performance of peripheral hearing. The integrity of auditory brainstem processing was evaluated by quantifying masking level difference (MLD) values and gap detection (GD) thresholds. Three monaural speech tests (time-compressed speech [CS], filtered speech [FS] and speech in noise [SIN]) were conducted to evaluate the processing of distorted speech materials by cortical auditory processing mechanisms. Evaluating performance of naïve, young normal-hearing subjects, as we did here, is indispensable for (a) evaluating the effectiveness of potential tests, (b) evaluating their suitability for the examination of patients, and (c) the revision and further development of central auditory tests."
"19020928","Understanding and managing experiential aspects of soundscapes at Muir woods national monument.","Research has found that human-caused noise can detract from the quality of the visitor experience in national parks and related areas. Moreover, impacts to the visitor experience can be managed by formulating indicators and standards of quality as suggested in park and outdoor recreation management frameworks, such as Visitor Experience and Resource Protection (VERP), as developed by the U.S. National Park Service. The research reported in this article supports the formulation of indicators and standards of quality for human-caused noise at Muir Woods National Monument, California. Phase I identified potential indicators of quality for the soundscape of Muir Woods. A visitor &quot;listening exercise&quot; was conducted, where respondents identified natural and human-caused sounds heard in the park and rated the degree to which each sound was &quot;pleasing&quot; or &quot;annoying.&quot; Certain visitor-caused sounds such as groups talking were heard by most respondents and were rated as annoying, suggesting that these sounds may be a good indicator of quality. Loud groups were heard by few people but were rated as highly annoying, whereas wind and water were heard by most visitors and were rated as highly pleasing. Phase II measured standards of quality for visitor-caused noise. Visitors were presented with a series of 30-second audio clips representing increasing amounts of visitor-caused sound in the park. Respondents were asked to rate the acceptability of each audio clip on a survey. Findings suggest a threshold at which visitor-caused sound is judged to be unacceptable, and is therefore considered as noise. A parallel program of sound monitoring in the park found that current levels of visitor-caused sound sometimes violate this threshold. Study findings provide an empirical basis to help formulate noise-related indicators and standards of quality in parks and related areas."
"18773733","Vibrotactile--auditory interactions are post-perceptual.","Vibrotactile stimuli can elicit compelling auditory sensations, even when sound energy levels are minimal and undetectable. It has previously been shown that subjects judge auditory tones embedded in white noise to be louder when they are accompanied by a vibrotactile stimulus of the same frequency. A first experiment replicated this result at four different levels of auditory stimulation (no tone, tone at detection threshold, tone at 5 dB above threshold, and tone at 10 dB above threshold). The presence of a vibrotactile stimulus induced an increase in the perceived loudness of auditory tones at three of the four values in this range. In two further experiments, a 2-interval forced-choice procedure was used to assess the nature of this cross-modal interaction. Subjects were biased when vibrotaction was applied in one interval, but applying vibrotaction in both intervals produced performance comparable to conditions without vibrotactile stimuli. This demonstrates that vibrotaction is sometimes ignored when judging the presence of an auditory tone. Hence the interaction between vibrotaction and audition does not appear to occur at an early perceptual level."
"18559825","Diabetes and hearing impairment in the United States: audiometric evidence from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999 to 2004.","BACKGROUND: Diabetes might affect the vasculature and neural system of the inner ear, leading to hearing impairment.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hearing impairment is more prevalent among U.S. adults with diabetes.DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of nationally representative data.SETTING: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999 to 2004.PARTICIPANTS: 5140 noninstitutionalized adults age 20 to 69 years who had audiometric testing.MEASUREMENTS: Hearing impairment was assessed from the pure tone average of thresholds over low or mid-frequencies (500, 1000, and 2000 Hz) and high frequencies (3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz) and was defined as mild or greater severity (pure tone average &gt;25 decibels hearing level [dB HL]) and moderate or greater severity (pure tone average &gt;40 dB HL).RESULTS: Hearing impairment was more prevalent among adults with diabetes. Age-adjusted prevalence of low- or mid-frequency hearing impairment of mild or greater severity in the worse ear was 21.3% (95% CI, 15.0% to 27.5%) among 399 adults with diabetes compared with 9.4% (CI, 8.2% to 10.5%) among 4741 adults without diabetes. Similarly, age-adjusted prevalence of high-frequency hearing impairment of mild or greater severity in the worse ear was 54.1% (CI, 45.9% to 62.3%) among those with diabetes compared with 32.0% (CI, 30.5% to 33.5%) among those without diabetes. The association between diabetes and hearing impairment was independent of known risk factors for hearing impairment, such as noise exposure, ototoxic medication use, and smoking (adjusted odds ratios for low- or mid-frequency and high-frequency hearing impairment were 1.82 [CI, 1.27 to 2.60] and 2.16 [CI, 1.47 to 3.18], respectively).LIMITATIONS: The diagnosis of diabetes was based on self-report. The investigators could not distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Noise exposure was based on participant recall.CONCLUSION: Hearing impairment is common in adults with diabetes, and diabetes seems to be an independent risk factor for the condition."
"18469720","The contribution of family history to hearing loss in an older population.","OBJECTIVES: Although it has been well established that the prevalence of and severity of hearing loss increase with age, the contribution of familial factors to age-related hearing loss cannot be quantified. This is largely because hearing loss in older people has both genetic and environmental contributions. As environmental factors play an increasing role with age, it is difficult to delineate the separate contribution of genetic factors to age-related hearing loss. In a population-based survey of hearing loss in a representative older Australian community, we attempted to overcome this using logistic regression analysis, accounting for known factors associated with hearing loss including age, sex, noise exposure at work, diabetes, and current smoking.DESIGN: We tested hearing thresholds using pure tone audiometry and used a forced choice questionnaire to determine the nature of family history in a population of individuals aged 50 yrs or older in a defined region, west of Sydney, Australia (N = 2669). We compared the characteristics of participants with and without family history of hearing loss. Of those reporting a positive family history, we compared subgroups for age, gender and severity of hearing loss, and trends by the severity of hearing loss. Logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) that compared the chances of having hearing loss in participants with and without family history, after adjusting for other factors known associated with hearing loss.RESULTS: Our findings indicate that family history was most strongly associated with moderate to severe age-related hearing loss. We found a strong association between maternal family history of hearing loss and moderate to severe hearing loss in women (adjusted OR 3.0; 95% CI 1.6-5.6 in women with without a maternal history). Paternal family history of hearing loss was also significantly, though less strongly, associated with moderate-severe hearing loss in men (adjusted OR 2.0; CI 1.01-3.9 in men with than without a paternal history).CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study are important in the identification of individuals whose auditory system may be genetically susceptible to aging and environmental insult. Genetic counseling may assist in ameliorating the effects of hearing loss."
"18409685","[Hearing function and solvent exposure: study of a worker population exposed to styrene].","The aim of the study was to investigate the ototoxic effects of occupational styrene exposure, in absence of other risk factors. Pure-tone audiometric thresholds of 32 workers exposed to styrene, but not to noise, in fibreglass reinforced plastic boat manufacturing process were detected and compared to audiometric thresholds of a control unexposed group composed by 60 subjects. Exposure to styrene was measured by urinary mandelic + phenylglyoxylic acid (mean value 149 mg/g crea, SD 80 mg/g crea). For all the frequencies investigated (0,5-1-2-3-4-6-8 KHz) the exposed group showed slight higher mean (median) audiometric thresholds (p &lt; 0.05) compared to controls matched by age and sex, except for 8 KHz in the right ear. The present experience seems to confirm the hypothesis that styrene exposure alone can determine a weak sensorineural high-frequency hearing loss. Such slight impairment, even if statistically significant, does not remarkably limit social hearing and do not involve legal medical aspects. Sample expansion and objective diagnostic tests (auditory brainstem evoked potentials, acoustic otoemissions) are needed."
"18404896","[Working and health conditions and preventive measures in a random sample of 5000 workers in the Veneto Region examined by telephone interview].","BACKGROUND: A survey was carried out in 2000 by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in a random sample of workers from 15 countries of the European Union in order to obtain information on occupational exposure, health problems and preventive measures taken at the workplaces.OBJECTIVES: To obtain similar information in workers in the Veneto Region and compare the results with those of the third European Survey on Working Conditions (ESWC). The results of the survey on Veneto Region workers were further analyzed, investigating the distribution by risk factors in each work sector, and the association between risk factors and reported health problems.METHODS: The ESWC questionnaire was adapted to the requirements of a telephone interview and a sample of 5000 workers (size based on the budget) between 15 and 64 years of age was randomly extracted from the regional list of telephone subscribers. The questionnaire was administered by trained interviewers. No statistical tests were used in the comparison between ESWC and Veneto Region results due to the lack of a priori hypotheses. Odds ratio (OR) was calculated in estimating the association between risk factors and symptoms; and p-value for OR trend across the increasing level of exposure was also obtained.RESULTS: Workers reported to be exposed for more than a quarter of their work time to: vibrations (20%), noise (19%), dusts, fumes vapours, chemicals (18%), repetitive hand/arm movements (50%), tiring/painful positions (46%); working at very high speed or tight deadlines (60%). 54.4% of the subjects reported working with computers. Taking as a reference the third ESWC in 2000, among Veneto Region workers in 2005 exposure was lower as regards physical, chemical and ergonomic risk factors, and similar as regards working at very high speed. The more frequently reported work-related health problems were: stress (26.9%), backache (17.8%), overall fatigue (11.9%), muscular pains in upper limbs (6.8%), headache (6.1%), sight problems (5.4%), anxiety (5.5%), muscular pain in lower limbs (4.3%), irritability (4.0%), hearing problems (2.3%). Except for stress, all symptoms/health problems were two-three times more frequently reported in the ESWC than in the Veneto Region survey where, conversely, the number of persons with at least one new sick- leave spell was higher. Lastly, there was no difference as regards preventive measures taken at the workplace: information on risks (78.2%), wearing personal protective equipment (28.7%), training paid by employer (28.7%). Among the Veneto Region workers, the most often reported risk factors were exposure to physical and chemical risk factors in industry/agriculture, and shift-work and working at very high speed in the services. The most commonly adopted preventive measures were information on risks and wearing of personal protective equipment in industry, and training in services. Moreover, among the Veneto Region workers, a significant exposure-dependent increase was reported for respiratory problems, allergies, dermatitis, hearing loss, accidents, back pain, pain in the upper and lower limbs, and headache. The risk of stress, anxiety, sleeping problems, stomach pain and headache increased when skills were not adequate to cope with job demand. In contrast, the perception of improved health conditions increased with increasing skill discretion, decision authority, social support (which are dimensions of control of job demand), but not with information on risk, training, or use of personal protective equipment.CONCLUSIONS: Data from the present survey provide useful insights on working and health conditions of workers in the Veneto Region, revealing problems that were subsequently investigated using other sources of information, as reported in the studies published elsewhere in this volume."
"18307089","Is the relation of social class to change in hearing threshold levels from childhood to middle age explained by noise, smoking, and drinking behaviour?","Recent work shows that variation in adult hearing function is related both to social class of origin and current social class. This study examines how much of this relationship after adjustment for childhood hearing impairment is explicable by occupational noise, current smoking, and alcohol consumption. A cohort of 9023 persons born in the UK during one week in 1958 was followed periodically, and hearing threshold levels (HTLs) were measured at 1 kHz and 4 kHz at age 45 years. Most (71% and 68%, at 1 kHz and 4 kHz respectively) of the relation to social class of origin of adult HTLs remains after adjustment for these other factors. For the relation to current social class, corresponding values are 64% and 44% (though varying by gender). The magnitude of social class effect is comparable to that of occupational noise. Susceptibility to hearing impairment is likely to be appreciably determined in early childhood."
"18247882","Effects of social, demographical and behavioral factors on the sound level evaluation in urban open spaces.","The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of social, demographical and behavioral factors as well as long-term sound experience on the subjective evaluation of sound level in urban open public spaces. This is based on a series of large scale surveys in 19 urban open spaces in Europe and China. The results suggest that the effects of social/demographical factors, including age, gender, occupation, education and residential status, on the sound level evaluation are generally insignificant, although occupation and education are two related factors and both correlate to the sound level evaluation more than other factors. The effects of some behavioral factors, including wearing earphones, reading/writing and moving activities, are also insignificant on the sound level evaluation, but the watching behavior is highly related to the sound level evaluation. Compared to the social, demographical and behavioral factors, the long-term sound experience, i.e. the acoustic environment at home, significantly affect the sound level evaluation in urban open spaces. It is important to note that between the social/demographical factors, there are generally significant correlations, although the correlation coefficients may not be high. It is also noted that there are considerable variations between different urban open spaces."
"18177170","The foreign language cocktail party problem: Energetic and informational masking effects in non-native speech perception.","Studies comparing native and non-native listener performance on speech perception tasks can distinguish the roles of general auditory and language-independent processes from those involving prior knowledge of a given language. Previous experiments have demonstrated a performance disparity between native and non-native listeners on tasks involving sentence processing in noise. However, the effects of energetic and informational masking have not been explicitly distinguished. Here, English and Spanish listener groups identified keywords in English sentences in quiet and masked by either stationary noise or a competing utterance, conditions known to produce predominantly energetic and informational masking, respectively. In the stationary noise conditions, non-native talkers suffered more from increasing levels of noise for two of the three keywords scored. In the competing talker condition, the performance differential also increased with masker level. A computer model of energetic masking in the competing talker condition ruled out the possibility that the native advantage could be explained wholly by energetic masking. Both groups drew equal benefit from differences in mean F0 between target and masker, suggesting that processes which make use of this cue do not engage language-specific knowledge."
"19894854","Behavioral measures of signal recognition thresholds in frogs in the presence and absence of chorus-shaped noise.","Anuran amphibians are superb animal models for investigating the mechanisms underlying acoustic signal perception amid high levels of background noise generated by large social aggregations of vocalizing individuals. Yet there are not well-established methods for quantifying a number of key measures of auditory perception in frogs, in part, because frogs are notoriously difficult subjects for traditional psychoacoustic experiments based on classical or operant conditioning. A common experimental approach for studying frog hearing and acoustic communication involves behavioral phonotaxis experiments, in which patterns of movement directed toward sound sources indicate the subjects' perceptual experiences. In this study, three different phonotaxis experiments were conducted using the same target signals and noise maskers to compare different experimental methods and analytical tools for deriving estimates of signal recognition thresholds in the presence or absence of &quot;chorus-shaped noise&quot; (i.e., artificial noise with a spectrum similar to that of real breeding choruses). Estimates of recognition thresholds based on measures of angular orientation, response probabilities, and response latencies were quite similar in both two-choice and no-choice phonotaxis tests. These results establish important baselines for comparing different methods of estimating signal recognition thresholds in frogs tested in various masking noise conditions."
"19842807","Hearing, use of hearing protection, and attitudes towards noise among young American adults.","The purpose of the present study was to investigate possible associations between college students' attitudes, risk-taking behaviour related to noisy activities, and hearing problems such as threshold shifts or self-experienced hearing symptoms. The sample included 258 students aged between 17 and 21 enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania, USA. A questionnaire measuring attitudes towards noise, use of hearing protection, and self-reported hearing symptoms was distributed among the students. After completing the questionnaire a hearing screening, including pure-tone audiometry and tympanometry, was conducted. The result revealed that 26% had thresholds poorer than the screening level of 20 dBHL. Attitudes were significantly related to self-experienced hearing symptoms, but not to threshold shifts. Attitudes and noise sensitivity was, significantly related to use of hearing protection. Hearing protection use was found in activities such as using firearms, mowing lawns, and when using noisy tools but was less reported for concerts and discotheques. It can be concluded that the young adults in this study expose themselves to hearing risks, since the use of hearing protection is in general very low."
"19773657","Impact of visual cues on directional benefit and preference: Part II--field tests.","OBJECTIVES: The field tests performed in the current investigation examined how visual cues impact the benefit provided by directional (DIR) microphone hearing aids in the real world. Specifically, the study tested the hypotheses that (1) the provision of visual cues would reduce the preference for DIR processing (re: omnidirectional [OMNI] microphone) and (2) laboratory audiovisual (AV) testing would predict real-world outcomes better than auditory-only testing.DESIGN: The same 24 hearing-impaired adults enrolled in the laboratory testing of this study compared microphone modes (DIR versus OMNI processing) in their everyday activities three times a day for 4 wk using paper and pencil journals. In each comparison, the participants were asked to identify an environment that favored DIR processing (e.g., the talker standing in front of the user and noise at his or her back), listen to speech amid noise via both the DIR and OMNI microphone modes, and then record the preferred microphone mode in the journal. To further understand what the listeners based their preference on, the participants were also asked to provide the reasons for their preferences. Microphone modes were compared when the listeners' eyes were either open or closed.RESULTS: The field results first suggested that OMNI processing was more frequently preferred over DIR processing. Visual cues were not found to have a significant effect on preference for DIR processing. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that when listeners indicated &quot;louder&quot; or &quot;less internal noise&quot; as the reasons for their microphone preference, the likelihood of preferring the OMNI mode increased significantly, suggesting that OMNI processing was preferred for its louder output and lower internal circuit noise level. Finally, the preference score obtained by the laboratory preference judgment task under the AV condition was shown to be the best predictor of microphone preference in the real world.CONCLUSIONS: The field data did not reveal the effect of visual cues on preference for DIR processing because preference was not altered by the availability of visual cues. This negative result may be due to the unsuccessful control of visual cues during the field trial. However, the finding that AV laboratory testing predicted field outcomes more accurately than did auditory-only testing demonstrates the role of visual cues in the real world and emphasizes the necessity of using AV testing in the laboratory to evaluate DIR microphone hearing aids. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the importance of factors other than DIR benefit-such as loudness and hearing aid internal noise-in determining preference for microphone mode in the real world."
"19739730","Modeling subjective evaluation of soundscape quality in urban open spaces: An artificial neural network approach.","This research aims to explore the feasibility of using computer-based models to predict the soundscape quality evaluation of potential users in urban open spaces at the design stage. With the data from large scale field surveys in 19 urban open spaces across Europe and China, the importance of various physical, behavioral, social, demographical, and psychological factors for the soundscape evaluation has been statistically analyzed. Artificial neural network (ANN) models have then been explored at three levels. It has been shown that for both subjective sound level and acoustic comfort evaluation, a general model for all the case study sites is less feasible due to the complex physical and social environments in urban open spaces; models based on individual case study sites perform well but the application range is limited; and specific models for certain types of location/function would be reliable and practical. The performance of acoustic comfort models is considerably better than that of sound level models. Based on the ANN models, soundscape quality maps can be produced and this has been demonstrated with an example."
"19248731","A comparison of two word-recognition tasks in multitalker babble: Speech Recognition in Noise Test (SPRINT) and Words-in-Noise Test (WIN).","BACKGROUND: The Speech Recognition in Noise Test (SPRINT) is a word-recognition instrument that presents the 200 Northwestern University Auditory Test No. 6 (NU-6) words binaurally at 50 dB HL in a multitalker babble at a 9 dB signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) (Cord et al, 1992). The SPRINT was developed by and used by the Army as a more valid predictor of communication abilities (than pure-tone thresholds or word-recognition in quiet) for issues involving fitness for duty from a hearing perspective of Army personnel. The Words-in-Noise test (WIN) is a slightly different word-recognition task in a fixed level multitalker babble with 10 NU-6 words presented at each of 7 S/N from 24 to 0 dB S/N in 4 dB decrements (Wilson, 2003; Wilson and McArdle, 2007). For the two instruments, both the babble and the speakers of the words are different. The SPRINT uses all 200 NU-6 words, whereas the WIN uses a maximum of 70 words.PURPOSE: The purpose was to compare recognition performances by 24 young listeners with normal hearing and 48 older listeners with sensorineural hearing on the SPRINT and WIN protocols.RESEARCH DESIGN: A quasi-experimental, mixed model design was used.STUDY SAMPLE: The 24 young listeners with normal hearing (19 to 29 years, mean = 23.3 years) were from the local university and had normal hearing (&lt; or = 20 dB HL; American National Standards Institute, 2004) at the 250-8000 Hz octave intervals. The 48 older listeners with sensorineural hearing loss (60 to 82 years, mean = 69.9 years) had the following inclusion criteria: (1) a threshold at 500 Hz between 15 and 30 dB HL, (2) a threshold at 1000 Hz between 20 and 40 dB HL, (3) a three-frequency puretone average (500, 1000, and 2000 Hz) of &lt; or = 40 dB HL, (4) word-recognition scores in quiet &gt; or = 40%, and (5) no history of middle ear or retrocochlear pathology as determined by an audiologic evaluation.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The speech materials were presented bilaterally in the following order: (1) the SPRINT at 50 dB HL, (2) two half lists of NU-6 words in quiet at 60 dB HL and 80 dB HL, and (3) the two 35-word lists of the WIN materials with the multitalker babble fixed at 60 dB HL. Data collection occurred during a 40-60 minute session. Recognition performances on each stimulus word were analyzed.RESULTS: The listeners with normal hearing obtained 92.5% correct on the SPRINT with a 50% point on the WIN of 2.7 dB S/N. The listeners with hearing loss obtained 65.3% correct on the SPRINT and a WIN 50% point at 12.0 dB S/N. The SPRINT and WIN were significantly correlated (r = -0.81, p &lt; .01), indicating that the SPRINT had good concurrent validity. The high-frequency, pure-tone average (1000, 2000, 4000 Hz) had higher correlations with the SPRINT, WIN, and NU-6 in quiet than did the traditional three-frequency pure-tone average (500, 1000, 2000 Hz).CONCLUSIONS: Graphically and numerically the SPRINT and WIN were highly related, which is indicative of good concurrent validity of the SPRINT."
"19246326","Precedence-effect-induced enhancement of prepulse inhibition in socially reared but not isolation-reared rats.","Attention to a prepulse presented shortly before a startling stimulus enhances prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle in normal people, but not in schizophrenics. Fear conditioning for the prepulse enhances PPI in socially reared, but not isolation-reared, rats. In humans, selective attention to acoustic signals against masking can be facilitated by precedence-effect-induced perceived spatial separation between the signal and the masker. This study investigated whether perceived spatial separation between a prepulse and a noise masker enhances PPI in socially reared rats and isolation-reared rats. The results show that both PPI and conditioning-induced PPI enhancement were larger in socially reared rats than in isolation-reared rats. More important, in socially reared, but not isolation-reared, rats, a further PPI enhancement was induced by precedence-effect-induced perceived separation between a prepulse and a masker only after the prepulse became fear conditioned. Thus, perceived separation facilitates normal rats' attention to a conditioned prepulse and enhances PPI. Isolation rearing impairs rats' ability to attend to ecologically significant acoustic events."
"21141241","Bimodal stimulus presentation and expanded auditory bandwidth improve older adults' speech perception.","OBJECTIVE: A pair of experiments investigated the hypothesis that bimodal (auditory-visual) speech presentation and expanded auditory bandwidth would improve speech intelligibility and increase working memory performance for older adults by reducing the cognitive effort needed for speech perception.BACKGROUND: Although telephone communication is important for helping older adults maintain social engagement, age-related sensory and working memory limits may make telephone conversations difficult.METHOD: Older adults with either age-normal hearing or mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss performed a running memory task. Participants heard word strings of unpredictable length and at the end of each string were required to repeat back the final three words.Words were presented monaurally in telephone bandwidth (300 Hz to 3300 Hz) or expanded bandwidth (50 Hz to 7500 Hz), in quiet (65 dBZ SPL), or in white noise (65 dBZ SPL with noise at 60 dBZ SPL), with or without a visual display of the talker.RESULTS: In quiet listening conditions, bimodal presentation increased the number of words correctly reported per trial but only for listeners with hearing loss and with high lipreading proficiency. Stimulus bandwidth did not affect performance. In noise, bimodal presentation and expanded bandwidth improved performance for all participant groups but did so by improving speech intelligibility, not by improving working memory.CONCLUSION: Expanded bandwidth and bimodal presentation can improve speech perceptibility in difficult listening conditions but may not always improve working memory performance.APPLICATION: Results can inform the design of telephone features to improve ease of communication for older adults."
"21140638","Unilateral deafness in adults: effects on communication and social interaction.","OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the self-reported consequences of profound unilateral deafness regarding communication and social interaction and to compare subjects' speech perception scores to those of normal-hearing individuals who were rendered temporarily unilaterally deaf.METHODS: Cross-sectional data from 30 individuals with unilateral deafness and 30 individuals with normal hearing (age, 14 to 75 years) were obtained through structured interviews and tests of audiovisual, auditory-only, and visual-only speech perception.RESULTS: In individuals with permanent unilateral deafness, 93% reported that hearing loss affected communication. Eighty-seven percent reported problems with speech perception in noisy settings. Other consequences were feelings of exclusion, reduced well-being, and extensive use of speech perception strategies. Inducing temporary unilateral deafness (through short-term blocking of one ear) in normal-hearing subjects produced similar effects on speech perception (27% score) as those experienced by unilaterally deaf subjects (25% score).CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with unilateral deafness experienced a significant disability in auditory function that affected their communication and social interaction. The major challenges were communicating in situations with background noise, in poor acoustic surroundings, and with limited access to speech-reading or direct listening. Under certain listening conditions, long-standing unilateral deafness seemed to yield no advantage over temporary deafness on one side."
"21053386","Predictors of use of hearing protection among a representative sample of farmers.","Farmers experience higher rates of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) than workers in most other industries. We developed a model of farmers' use of hearing protection, and tested it with a random sample (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>532) of farmers from the upper Midwest. Barriers to using hearing protection (e.g., difficulty communicating; OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>.44, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.003) were negatively related to use. Greater access/availability of hearing protectors (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.75, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.010) and male gender (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>.43, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.019) were positively related to use. The model correctly predicted use of hearing protection for 74% of the cases. Overall, farmers demonstrated low hearing protector use, and results were similar to those from previous studies of non-farm workers. Findings from this study will be useful in designing interventions to increase farmers' hearing protector use and decrease their rates of NIHL."
"20218750","Improving hearing health for farming families.","INTRODUCTION: Occupational noise injury and hearing loss are common features of agricultural workforces internationally. Farmsafe Australia has identified hearing health as one of its 4 key priority goals and targets. Currently, approximately 60-70% of Australian farmers have measurable hearing loss, compared with 27% of those in the general Australian community. This article describes the findings of a community based demonstration project to address hearing health issues conducted in the Australian state of New South Wales. This program sought to implement local demonstration projects in 3 communities to identify what works well in hearing health promotion with farmers and what could be applied more broadly throughout Australia.METHODS: Local advisory groups were established in each community to guide project development and implementation. Project implementation focused on 3 major aspects: (1) increasing awareness of priority noise injury prevention and hearing health practices; (2) improving access to hearing health services; and (3) networking services in local communities. Area-specific training was undertaken for stakeholders to maximize local information links. Service utilization data were monitored and analysed.RESULTS: There was variability among sites; however in general there was an increased awareness of hearing health issues by farming families and expanded opportunities for farmers to access screening services. Utilization rates of hearing services also increased markedly in one community. Local hearing health networks were strengthened by linkages to key stakeholders outside the health sector. Previously unidentified methods of promoting hearing health (eg using agricultural retail outlets that supply hearing protection equipment and are accepted by farmers as an information source) were identified and utilized.CONCLUSIONS: Hearing health promotion with farmers in local communities can be enhanced through utilization and strengthening of local networks. Integration of hearing health initiatives with other agencies already working with farming families will be important in developing and enhancing long-term sustainable outcomes. Continued work at a national level to assist in stimulating local action will be required to build on the potential gains in reducing noise injury in the farming community."
"20166310","Effect of age on directional microphone hearing aid benefit and preference.","BACKGROUND: Despite the recognition that the directional microphone hearing aid (DMHA) is an important intervention aimed at helping older hearing-impaired adults understand speech in noisy environments, there is little evidence that older listeners can actually benefit from directional processing.PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to determine if older and younger adults can obtain and perceive comparable benefit afforded by DMHAs.STUDY SAMPLE: Twenty-four hearing-impaired adults aged 36 through 79 yr were fit with switchable-microphone hearing aids and tested in the laboratory and the field.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: In the laboratory, the listeners' directional benefit and preferences for microphone modes (directional vs. omnidirectional) were assessed using various speech-recognition-in-noise tests. In the four-week field trial, a paired-comparison technique and paper-and-pencil journals were used to determine the benefit provided by directional processing. The effects of age on directional benefit/preference were analyzed using generalized linear models with controlling for the effect of hearing loss.RESULTS: The results revealed that age did not have a significant effect on directional benefit and preference as measured in the laboratory. However, the field data showed that older age was significantly associated with a lower preference for the directional mode.CONCLUSION: These results indicate that although listeners of different ages may obtain and perceive comparable benefit from DMHAs in laboratory testing, older users tend to perceive less benefit than do younger users in the real world. The implications of these findings are discussed."
"22122960","Increased vitamin plasma levels in Swedish military personnel treated with nutrients prior to automatic weapon training.","Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a significant clinical, social, and economic issue. The development of novel therapeutic agents to reduce NIHL will potentially benefit multiple very large noise-exposed populations. Oxidative stress has been identified as a significant contributor to noise-induced sensory cell death and NIHL, and several antioxidant strategies have now been suggested for potential translation to human subjects. One such strategy is a combination of beta-carotene, vitamins C and E, and magnesium, which has shown promise for protection against NIHL in rodent models, and is being evaluated in a series of international human clinical trials using temporary (military gunfire, audio player use) and permanent (stamping factory, military airbase) threshold shift models (NCT00808470). The noise exposures used in the recently completed Swedish military gunfire study described in this report did not, on average, result in measurable changes in auditory function using conventional pure-tone thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) amplitudes as metrics. However, analysis of the plasma samples confirmed significant elevations in the bloodstream 2 hours after oral consumption of active clinical supplies, indicating the dose is realistic. The plasma outcomes are encouraging, but clinical acceptance of any novel therapeutic critically depends on demonstration that the agent reduces noise-induced threshold shift in randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective human clinical trials. Although this noise insult did not induce hearing loss, the trial design and study protocol can be applied to other populations exposed to different noise insults."
"22104328","Improvement in word recognition score with level is associated with hearing aid ownership among patients with hearing loss.","Market surveys consistently show that only 22% of those with hearing loss own hearing aids. This is often ascribed to cosmetics, but is it possible that patients apply a different auditory criterion than do audiologists and manufacturers? We tabulated hearing aid ownership in a survey of 1000 consecutive patients. We separated hearing loss cases, with one cohort in which word recognition in quiet could improve with gain (vs. 40 dB HL) and another without such improvement but nonetheless with audiometric thresholds within the manufacturer's fitting ranges. Overall, we found that exactly 22% of hearing loss patients in this sample owned hearing aids; the same finding has been reported in many previous, well-accepted surveys. However, while all patients in the two cohorts experienced difficulty in noise, patients in the cohort without word recognition improvement were found to own hearing aids at a rate of 0.3%, while those patients whose word recognition could increase with level were found to own hearing aids at a rate of 50%. Results also coherently fit a logistic model where shift of the word recognition performance curve by level corresponded to the likelihood of ownership. In addition to the common attribution of low hearing aid usage to patient denial, cosmetic issues, price, or social stigma, these results provide one alternative explanation based on measurable improvement in word recognition performance."
"22059840","Face the noise: embodied responses to nonverbal vocalizations of discrete emotions.","Extensive prior research has shown that the perception of an emotional facial expression automatically elicits a corresponding facial expression in the observer. Theories of embodied emotion, however, suggest that such reactions might also occur across expressive channels, because simulation is based on integrated motoric and affective representations of that emotion. In the present studies, we examined this idea by focusing on facial and experiential reactions to nonverbal emotion vocalizations. In Studies 1 and 2, we showed that both hearing and reproducing vocalizations of anger, disgust, happiness, and sadness resulted in specific facial behaviors, as well as congruent self-reported emotions (Study 2). In Studies 3 and 4, we showed that the inhibition of congruent facial actions impaired listeners' processing of emotion vocalizations (Study 3), as well as their experiences of a concordant subjective state (Study 4). Results support the idea that cross-channel simulations of others' states serve facilitative functions similar to more strict imitations of observed expressive behavior, suggesting flexibility in the motoric and affective systems involved in emotion processing and interpersonal emotion transfer. We discuss implications for embodiment research and the social consequences of expressing and matching emotions across nonverbal channels."
"21959117","Hearing status among aircraft maintenance personnel in a commercial airline company.","The aim was to study subjective and objective hearing loss in a population of aircraft maintenance workers and identify predictors. A total of 327 aircraft maintenance personnel answered a self-administered work environment questionnaire (response rate 76%) and underwent audiometric test. The mean values for the hearing threshold at 3, 4, and 6 kHz for the ear with the most hearing loss were compared with a Swedish population database of persons not occupationally exposed to noise. Equivalent noise exposure during a working day was measured. Relationships between subjective and objective hearing loss and possible predictors (age, years of employment, self-reported exposure to solvents, blood pressure, and psycho-social factors) were analyzed by multiple logistic regression. At younger ages (&lt;40 years), aircraft maintenance workers had higher hearing thresholds (1-3 dB) compared to the reference group, but such a difference was not found in older employees. Relationships were found between age and objective hearing loss, and between exposure to solvents and reported subjective hearing loss. Equivalent noise exposure during working days were 70-91 dB(A) with a maximal noise level of 119 dB(A). Aircraft maintenance workers are exposed to equivalent noise levels above the Swedish occupational standard, including some very high peak exposures. Younger employees have a higher age-matched hearing threshold level compared with a reference group. Thus, there is a need for further preventive measures."
"21782007","The effects of chronic tinnitus caused by acoustic trauma on social behaviour and anxiety in rats.","Tinnitus is associated with significant increases in anxiety disorders in humans, which is thought to affect social interaction; however, there has been only one previous study of the effects of tinnitus on social interaction in animals treated with salicylate and no previous study of the effects of tinnitus on anxiety in animals. In the present study, we used acoustic trauma to induce tinnitus in rats and investigated its effects on social interaction and anxiety in animals confirmed to have tinnitus. When social behaviours were grouped, we found that animals with tinnitus engaged in significantly more aggressive behaviours toward both tinnitus and sham control animals (P=0.03). When individual social behaviours were analysed without considering whether a tinnitus or sham animal was interacting with a member of its own treatment group, tinnitus animals were found to engage in significantly more anogenital investigation (P=0.01) and significantly less social grooming (P=0.003). When the data were analysed according to whether an animal was interacting with a member of its own group, tinnitus animals were found to bite sham animals significantly more than other tinnitus animals (P=0.005). Sham animals also bit tinnitus animals significantly more than other sham animals (P=0.02), as well as climbing away from them more (P=0.04), kicking (P=0.003), nudging them more (P=0.04), and sleeping with them more (P=0.02). By contrast, sham animals sniffed tinnitus animals significantly less than sham animals (P=0.05). There were no significant differences between the sham and tinnitus animals in performance in the elevated plus and elevated T maze tests of anxiety. However, tinnitus animals displayed a slight but significant increase in locomotor activity in the open field (P=0.04). These data suggest that tinnitus results in complex changes in social interaction in rats, which are not due simply to increases in anxiety."
"21768731","Hearing speech in music.","The masking effect of a piano composition, played at different speeds and in different octaves, on speech-perception thresholds was investigated in 15 normal-hearing and 14 moderately-hearing-impaired subjects. Running speech (just follow conversation, JFC) testing and use of hearing aids increased the everyday validity of the findings. A comparison was made with standard audiometric noises [International Collegium of Rehabilitative Audiology (ICRA) noise and speech spectrum-filtered noise (SPN)]. All masking sounds, music or noise, were presented at the same equivalent sound level (50 dBA). The results showed a significant effect of piano performance speed and octave (P&lt;.01). Low octave and fast tempo had the largest effect; and high octave and slow tempo, the smallest. Music had a lower masking effect than did ICRA noise with two or six speakers at normal vocal effort (P&lt;.01) and SPN (P&lt;.05). Subjects with hearing loss had higher masked thresholds than the normal-hearing subjects (P&lt;.01), but there were smaller differences between masking conditions (P&lt;.01). It is pointed out that music offers an interesting opportunity for studying masking under realistic conditions, where spectral and temporal features can be varied independently. The results have implications for composing music with vocal parts, designing acoustic environments and creating a balance between speech perception and privacy in social settings."
"21388780","[Occupational noise induced hearing loss acknowledgement: Opinions of a regional occupational disease commission].","CONTEXT: In France, occupational noise-induced hearing loss is compensated by the &quot;Régime Général&quot; of the French Social Security according to the system of the tables of occupational diseases. If administrative and/or exposure criteria are lacking, the regional occupational disease commission (CRRMP) is seized to pronounce an opinion - favourable or not - on the direct link between occupational activity and the deafness.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at determining the decisive factors in this opinion.METHODS: An exhaustive retrospective investigation analysed conclusions of CRRMP of the region Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur-Corsica related to the noise-induced hearing loss declarations emitted anonymously between January 1st, 2005 and December 31st, 2007. Favourable and unfavourable opinions were listed then cross-examined against the sociodemographics data of the employees, areas of expertise of the physicians at the origin of the initial medical certificate, grounds for submission to the commission, the occupational physician's opinion on the occupational origin, the results of the engineering consultant's investigation, the audiogram of the first observation of injury and those made in period of noise exposure.RESULTS: One hundred and twenty conclusions were analyzed. Claimants, typically male, 59-year-old on average, mainly came from the sectors of the metal industry (46.7%), transportation (20.8%) and building and civil engineering works (15.8%). All in all, 57.5% of the declarations were refused. These refusals were mainly connected to an opinion unfavourable, unexploitable or absent in the occupational physician, an overrun of the care period when it lasted 5 years and more and the absence of hearing deficit during the exposure.PERSPECTIVES: The results of our study lead to recommend the implementation of a certificate of noise exposure and the realization of an audiogram at the end of exposure to reduce the number of badly informed files and bring an answer more adapted to the demands of occupational noise-induced hearing loss acknowledgements."
"21307006","Normal adult aging and the contextual influences affecting speech and meaningful sound perception.","It is widely accepted that hearing loss increases markedly with age, beginning in the fourth decade ISO 7029 (2000). Age-related hearing loss is typified by high-frequency threshold elevation and associated reductions in speech perception because speech sounds, especially consonants, become inaudible. Nevertheless, older adults often report additional and progressive difficulties in the perception and comprehension of speech, often highlighted in adverse listening conditions that exceed those reported by younger adults with a similar degree of high-frequency hearing loss (Dubno, Dirks, &amp; Morgan) leading to communication difficulties and social isolation (Weinstein &amp; Ventry). Some of the age-related decline in speech perception can be accounted for by peripheral sensory problems but cognitive aging can also be a contributing factor. In this article, we review findings from the psycholinguistic literature predominantly over the last four years and present a pilot study illustrating how normal age-related changes in cognition and the linguistic context can influence speech-processing difficulties in older adults. For significant progress in understanding and improving the auditory performance of aging listeners to be made, we discuss how future research will have to be much more specific not only about which interactions between auditory and cognitive abilities are critical but also how they are modulated in the brain."
"21281058","Speech recognition with BAHA simulator in subjects with acquired unilateral sensorineural hearing loss.","CONCLUSION: We question the justification for the cost of a surgically implanted device for the restoration of limited circumstances of audible communication, although we understand that the decision is taken depending on the social relevance of communication or personal criteria.OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the BAHA simulator (BAHAS) system in subjects with acquired unilateral sensorineural hearing loss. In particular we tested the changes of speech reception threshold (SRT) in relation to different speech source positions, with a background of diffuse noise.METHODS: The primary message consisting of lists of Italian sentences was delivered from a loudspeaker placed at horizontal azimuths of 0°, 90°, 180° and 270°; the interference consisted of uncorrelated speech-shaped noise simultaneously delivered by four loudspeakers at a fixed intensity. The speech recognition tests were administered to 11 patients with BAHAS either on or off; hence each patient underwent 8 acoustic conditions (4 primary message directions × 2 BAHAS conditions). The SRT (50% correct responses) was measured by a simple 2 dB step adaptive procedure. Ten normal-hearing subjects served as the control group.RESULTS: Our data demonstrated that even for the acoustic condition where BAHAS should be more useful (i.e. lateral speech toward the impaired side), it was definitely ineffective in the study conditions."

"23257577","Noise-induced hearing loss.","Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) still remains a problem in developed countries, despite reduced occupational noise exposure, strict standards for hearing protection and extensive public health awareness campaigns. Therefore NIHL continues to be the focus of noise research activities. This paper summarizes progress achieved recently in our knowledge of NIHL. It includes papers published between the years 2008-2011 (in English), which were identified by a literature search of accessible medical and other relevant databases. A substantial part of this research has been concerned with the risk of NIHL in the entertainment sector, particularly in professional, orchestral musicians. There are also constant concerns regarding noise exposure and hearing risk in &quot;hard to control&quot; occupations, such as farming and construction work. Although occupational noise has decreased since the early 1980s, the number of young people subject to social noise exposure has tripled. If the exposure limits from the Noise at Work Regulations are applied, discotheque music, rock concerts, as well as music from personal music players are associated with the risk of hearing loss in teenagers and young adults. Several recent research studies have increased the understanding of the pathomechanisms of acoustic trauma, the genetics of NIHL, as well as possible dietary and pharmacologic otoprotection in acoustic trauma. The results of these studies are very promising and offer grounds to expect that targeted therapies might help prevent the loss of sensory hair cells and protect the hearing of noise-exposed individuals. These studies emphasize the need to launch an improved noise exposure policy for hearing protection along with developing more efficient norms of NIHL risk assessment."
"22702132","[On classification of occupational neuro-sensory deafness].","The article covers data on wide prevalence of occupational neuro-sensory deafness in Russian Federation where nowadays three major deafness classifications are applied, international, for noise-related occupations and for medical and social examination. The authors analyzed present classifications of deafness, emphasized positive and negative aspects of each classification from occupational medicine viewpoint. Several classifications applied at the same time complicate professional activity of specialists solving diagnostic, occupational and social problems of patients with occupational deafness and result in conflicts. Advantage of the classification for noise-related occupations is that it enables to evaluate premorbid deafness, since early signs of ear alteration due to noise, and even slight negative changes in hearing could be addressed by specialists (as stages and degrees cover 10 dB differences), however review of audiometric assessment is necessary for noise-related occupations. To increase efficiency of ENT-specialists work in diagnosis and prevention of occupational neuro-sensory deafness, legal and methodic basis should be developed."
"22580521","Sub-chronic exposure to noise affects locomotor activity and produces anxiogenic and depressive like behavior in rats.","Noise is defined as a displeasing and unwanted sound. It is one of the most encountered stressor to which mankind is exposed. Frustration, poor reading, impaired hearing and difficulty in problem solving activities are the common consequences of noise stress. It has been reported to produce atrophy of dendrites and alterations in neurotransmitter levels. Long term exposure to inescapable noise stress induces exhaustion, defeat, annoyance followed by decreased muscle movement, social contacts and mood changes. The present study was aimed to investigate the detrimental effects of noise exposure on behavior of rats and its association with altered neurochemistry. Changes in neurotransmitter levels in different brain regions including hippocampus have been reported following noise exposure and these changes in neurotransmitters levels have also been associated with altered behavior. In the present study, locomotor activity in rats was assessed by open field test (OFT) while anxiety and depressive behavior was monitored by elevated plus maze (EPM) and tail suspension (TST) tests. The results showed that 15 days sub-chronic exposure to noise stress induced anxiety and depression like behavior in male rats. These behavioral deficits observed in the present study suggest that an altered brain serotonergic and dopaminergic activity may be involved in the various psychological disorders following exposure to noise stress."
"22559390","Sound level discrimination by gray treefrogs in the presence and absence of chorus-shaped noise.","An important aspect of hearing and acoustic communication is the ability to discriminate differences in sound level. Little is known about level discrimination in anuran amphibians (frogs and toads), for which vocal communication in noisy social environments is often critical for reproduction. This study used two-choice phonotaxis tests to investigate the ability of females of Cope's gray treefrog (Hyla chrysoscelis) to discriminate between two advertisement calls differing only in sound pressure level by 2, 4, or 6 dB. Tests were conducted in the presence and absence of chorus-shaped noise (73 dB) and using two different ranges of signal levels (73-79 dB and 79-85 dB). Females discriminated between two signals differing by as little as 2-4 dB. In contrast to expectations based on the &quot;near miss to Weber's law&quot; in birds and mammals, level discrimination was slightly better at the lower range of signal amplitudes, a finding consistent with earlier studies of frogs and insects. Realistic levels of background noise simulating a breeding chorus had no discernable effect on discrimination at the sound level differences tested in this study. These results have important implications for studies of auditory masking and signaling behavior in the contexts of anuran hearing and sound communication."
"22240459","Spatial release from masking in a free-field source identification task by gray treefrogs.","Humans and other animals often communicate acoustically in noisy social groups, in which the background noise generated by other individuals can mask signals of interest. When listening to speech in the presence of speech-like noise, humans experience a release from auditory masking when target and masker are spatially separated. We investigated spatial release from masking (SRM) in a free-field call recognition task in Cope's gray treefrog (Hyla chrysoscelis). In this species, reproduction requires that females successfully detect, recognize, and localize a conspecific male in the noisy social environment of a breeding chorus. Using no-choice phonotaxis assays, we measured females' signal recognition thresholds in response to a target signal (an advertisement call) in the presence and absence of chorus-shaped noise. Females experienced about 3 dB of masking release, compared with a co-localized condition, when the masker was displaced 90° in azimuth from the target. The magnitude of masking release was independent of the spectral composition of the target (carriers of 1.3 kHz, 2.6 kHz, or both). Our results indicate that frogs experience a modest degree of spatial unmasking when performing a call recognition task in the free-field, and suggest that variation in signal spectral content has small effects on both source identification and spatial unmasking. We discuss these results in the context of spatial unmasking in vertebrates and call recognition in frogs."
"24329490","The ICF Core Sets for hearing loss: researcher perspective, Part II: Linking outcome measures to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF).","OBJECTIVE: To link outcome measures used in audiological research to the ICF classification and thereby describe audiological research from the ICF perspective.DESIGN: Through a peer-reviewed or a joint linking procedure, link outcome measures to the ICF classification system using standardized ICF linking rules. Additional linking rules were developed in combination with the established rules to overcome difficulties when connecting audiological data to ICF. Absolute and relative frequencies of ICF categories were reported.STUDY SAMPLE: The identified outcome measures from the previous study (Part I) constituted the empirical material.RESULTS: In total, 285 ICF categories were identified. The most prevalent categories were related to listening, hearing functions, auditory perceptions, emotions and the physical environment, such as noise and hearing aids. Categories related to communication showed lower relative frequencies, as did categories related to the social and attitudinal environment.CONCLUSIONS: Based on the linked outcome measures, communication as a research topic is subordinated to other research topics. The same conclusion can be drawn for research targeting the social and attitudinal environment of adults with HL. Difficulties in the linking procedure were highlighted and discussed, and suggestions for future revisions of the ICF from the audiological perspective were described."
"24231423","Classroom acoustics and hearing ability as determinants for perceived social climate and intentions to stay at work.","Background noise and room acoustics may impede social interactions by interfering with oral communication and other cognitive processes. Accordingly, recent research in school environments has showed that social relationships with peers and teachers are described more negatively in rooms with long reverberation times (RT). The purpose of this study was to investigate how RT and hearing ability (i.e., hearing thresholds [HT] and distortion product oto-acoustic emissions) were associated with school teachers' perceptions of the social climate at work and their intentions to stay on the job. School teachers (n = 107) from 10 schools that worked in classrooms classified by acoustical experts as &quot;short RT&quot; (3 schools, mean RT 0.41-0.47 s), &quot;medium RT&quot; (3 schools, mean RT 0.50-0.53 s), and &quot;long RT&quot; (4 schools, mean RT 0.59-0.73 s) were examined. Teachers who worked in classrooms with long RT perceived their social climate to be more competitive, conflict laden, and less relaxed and comfortable. They were more doubtful about staying on the job. Even if the teachers were generally satisfied with their work the results suggest that the comfort at work may have been further improved by acoustical interventions that focus on reducing sound reflections in the classrooms. Yet, due the study design and the novelty of the findings the potential practical significance of our observations remains to be evaluated."
"24055623","Spatial release from masking improves sound pattern discrimination along a biologically relevant pulse-rate continuum in gray treefrogs.","Many frogs form large choruses during their mating season in which males produce loud advertisement calls to attract females and repel rival males. High background noise levels in these social aggregations can impair vocal perception. In humans, spatial release from masking contributes to our ability to understand speech in noisy social groups. Here, we tested the hypothesis that spatial separation between target signals and 'chorus-shaped noise' improves the ability of female gray treefrogs (Hyla chrysoscelis) to perform a behavioral discrimination task based on perceiving differences in the pulsatile structure of advertisement calls. We used two-stimulus choice tests to measure phonotaxis (approach toward sound) in response to calls differing in pulse rate along a biologically relevant continuum between conspecific (50 pulses s(-1)) and heterospecific (20 pulses s(-1)) calls. Signals were presented in quiet, in colocated noise, and in spatially separated noise. In quiet conditions, females exhibited robust preferences for calls with relatively faster pulse rates more typical of conspecific calls. Behavioral discrimination between calls differing in pulse rate was impaired in the presence of colocated noise but similar between quiet and spatially separated noise conditions. Our results indicate that spatial release from energetic masking facilitates a biologically important temporal discrimination task in frogs. We discuss these results in light of previous work on spatial release from masking in frogs and other animals."
"24018571","Hearing status in older persons: a significant determinant of depression and loneliness? Results from the longitudinal aging study amsterdam.","PURPOSE: In this study, the authors' aims were to (a) determine the longitudinal relationships between baseline hearing status and 4-year follow-up depression and loneliness in an older population and (b) investigate possible differences across subgroups in these relationships.METHOD: The authors used data from 2 waves of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (4-year follow-up, baseline ages 63-93 years). Sample sizes were 996 (self-report analyses) and 830 (speech-in-noise test analyses). The authors used multiple linear regression analyses to assess the associations between baseline hearing status and 4-year follow-up of depression, social loneliness, and emotional loneliness. Hearing was measured by self-report and by a speech-in-noise test. Age, gender, hearing aid use, baseline depression or loneliness, and relevant confounders and effect modifiers were incorporated.RESULTS: Both hearing measures showed significant associations with loneliness (p &lt; .05), but these effects were confined to specific subgroups of older persons. For instance, adverse effects were confined to nonusers of hearing aids (self-report, social loneliness model) and men (self-report and speech-in-noise test, emotional-loneliness model). No significant effects appeared for depression.CONCLUSION: Significant adverse effects of poor hearing on loneliness were found for specific subgroups of older persons. In future research, investigators should further examine the subgroup effects observed. Eventually, this may contribute to the development of tailored prevention programs."
"23994815","Understanding the neurophysiological basis of auditory abilities for social communication: a perspective on the value of ethological paradigms.","Acoustic communication between animals requires them to detect, discriminate, and categorize conspecific or heterospecific vocalizations in their natural environment. Laboratory studies of the auditory-processing abilities that facilitate these tasks have typically employed a broad range of acoustic stimuli, ranging from natural sounds like vocalizations to &quot;artificial&quot; sounds like pure tones and noise bursts. However, even when using vocalizations, laboratory studies often test abilities like categorization in relatively artificial contexts. Consequently, it is not clear whether neural and behavioral correlates of these tasks (1) reflect extensive operant training, which drives plastic changes in auditory pathways, or (2) the innate capacity of the animal and its auditory system. Here, we review a number of recent studies, which suggest that adopting more ethological paradigms utilizing natural communication contexts are scientifically important for elucidating how the auditory system normally processes and learns communication sounds. Additionally, since learning the meaning of communication sounds generally involves social interactions that engage neuromodulatory systems differently than laboratory-based conditioning paradigms, we argue that scientists need to pursue more ethological approaches to more fully inform our understanding of how the auditory system is engaged during acoustic communication.

"23927113","Bayesian adaptive estimation of the auditory filter.","A Bayesian adaptive procedure for estimating the auditory-filter shape was proposed and evaluated using young, normal-hearing listeners at moderate stimulus levels. The resulting quick-auditory-filter (qAF) procedure assumed the power spectrum model of masking with the auditory-filter shape being modeled using a spectrally symmetric, two-parameter rounded-exponential (roex) function. During data collection using the qAF procedure, listeners detected the presence of a pure-tone signal presented in the spectral notch of a noise masker. Dependent on the listener's response on each trial, the posterior probability distributions of the model parameters were updated, and the resulting parameter estimates were then used to optimize the choice of stimulus parameters for the subsequent trials. Results showed that the qAF procedure gave similar parameter estimates to the traditional threshold-based procedure in many cases and was able to reasonably predict the masked signal thresholds. Additional measurements suggested that occasional failures of the qAF procedure to reliably converge could be a consequence of incorrect responses early in a qAF track. The addition of a parameter describing lapses of attention reduced the likelihood of such failures. "
"23862822","Perceptual constancy in auditory perception of distance to railway tracks.","Distance to a sound source can be accurately estimated solely from auditory information. With a sound source such as a train that is passing by at a relatively large distance, the most important auditory information for the listener for estimating its distance consists of the intensity of the sound, spectral changes in the sound caused by air absorption, and the motion-induced rate of change of intensity. However, these cues are relative because prior information/experience of the sound source-its source power, its spectrum and the typical speed at which it moves-is required for such distance estimates. This paper describes two listening experiments that allow investigation of further prior contextual information taken into account by listeners-viz., whether they are indoors or outdoors. Asked to estimate the distance to the track of a railway, it is shown that listeners assessing sounds heard inside the dwelling based their distance estimates on the expected train passby sound level outdoors rather than on the passby sound level actually experienced indoors. This form of perceptual constancy may have consequences for the assessment of annoyance caused by railway noise. "
"23862819","A multi-resolution envelope-power based model for speech intelligibility.","The speech-based envelope power spectrum model (sEPSM) presented by Jørgensen and Dau [(2011). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 130, 1475-1487] estimates the envelope power signal-to-noise ratio (SNRenv) after modulation-frequency selective processing. Changes in this metric were shown to account well for changes of speech intelligibility for normal-hearing listeners in conditions with additive stationary noise, reverberation, and nonlinear processing with spectral subtraction. In the latter condition, the standardized speech transmission index [(2003). IEC 60268-16] fails. However, the sEPSM is limited to conditions with stationary interferers, due to the long-term integration of the envelope power, and cannot account for increased intelligibility typically obtained with fluctuating maskers. Here, a multi-resolution version of the sEPSM is presented where the SNRenv is estimated in temporal segments with a modulation-filter dependent duration. The multi-resolution sEPSM is demonstrated to account for intelligibility obtained in conditions with stationary and fluctuating interferers, and noisy speech distorted by reverberation or spectral subtraction. The results support the hypothesis that the SNRenv is a powerful objective metric for speech intelligibility prediction."
"23811690","Noise-induced hearing loss in workers exposed to urban stressors.","The technological and industrial progress together with the intensification of vehicular traffic and the adoption of new social habits are the cause of an increasing noise pollution with possible negative effects on the auditory system. This study aims to assess the noise exposure levels and the effects on the hearing threshold in outdoor and indoor male workers of a big Italian city. The study was carried out on 357 outdoor male workers, exposed to urban noise and on a control group of 357 unexposed indoor workers. Noise levels were measured in 30 outdoor and indoor areas. The subjects underwent tonal liminal audiometry in order to determine the value of their hearing threshold. During their working activity, outdoor and indoor workers are exposed to different noise levels LEX&lt;80 dB(A). At mid-low frequencies (250-2000 Hz), the results show significant differences in the average values of hearing threshold between the two groups in both ears and for all age classes; there are no significant differences between the two groups at higher frequencies. The outdoor noise levels measured are not usually ototoxic and the hearing loss at mid-low frequencies is not characteristic of the exposure to industrial noise. For these reasons the Authors hypothesize that the results may be due to the combined effect of the exposure to noise and to ototoxic air pollutants. The impairment of speech frequencies is disabling and involves the risk of missed forensic recognition."
"23716258","Energetic and informational masking in a simulated restaurant environment.","Participants were seated at a central table for two in a virtual restaurant, simulated over headphones. They listened to the person across the table. Speech reception thresholds (SRTs) were measured as a function of the number of interfering sources distributed across other tables in the room; those sources were either speech-shaped noises or competing speech. The restaurant either was enclosed by acoustically reflective surfaces or was anechoic. Variations in SRT for speech-shaped noises were accurately predicted (r = 0.96) by a model of spatial release from masking based on the additive combination of better-ear listening and binaural unmasking. However, SRTs for interfering voices followed a different pattern. A single interfering voice gave a lower SRT than a single speech-shaped noise source (by 6.3 dB in anechoic conditions and 1.2 dB in reverberant conditions). This difference can be attributed to the effects of dip listening and to the exploitation of differences between voices in fundamental frequency (F0). SRTs for two interfering voices were markedly higher than for a single voice, particularly when the interfering voice was the same as the target voice. Multiple speech interferers produced more masking than multiple noise interferers. This effect can be attributed to informational masking (IM). These results indicate that current models require some elaboration before they will produce accurate predictions of intelligibility in noisy social environments."
"23689297","Interleukin-1ß gene polymorphism and hearing loss related to the history of occupational noise exposure in Brazilian elderly.","Hearing loss is the most common sensory impairment in older people, and may have social and psychological consequences, such as social isolation, frustration and depression. Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is an interaction of both genetic and environmental factors. Some studies have led to the identification of possible NIHL susceptibility genes. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the polymorphism of the interleukin (IL)-1ß gene at position + 3954 was associated with complaints of hearing loss due to occupational exposure. The sample was composed of elderly people with hearing loss (age = 60 years) divided into two groups: 99 with occupational exposure to noise and 193 without exposure. Information on occupational exposure to noise was obtained through interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire. Hearing acuity was measured from 500 to 6000 Hz and the IL-1ß genotype was obtained by the polymerase chain reaction- restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. Differences in allelic and genotypic frequencies, and the association between genotypic frequencies and complaints of hearing loss due to occupational exposure, were analyzed by the Chi-square test at the 5% significance level. Fifty-one percent of the elderly were homozygous for the ancestral allele (C), 17.2% were homozygous for the polymorphic allele (T) and 31.8% were heterozygous. The frequency was found to be 67-33% C to allele T. There was no significant association between polymorphism in gene IL-1ß and hearing loss associated with occupational exposure (<U+03C7>2 = 0.538; P = 0.676). No association was found with the polymorphism of the IL-1ß +3954 C/T gene and hearing loss associated with the occupational noise exposure history."
"23651462","A short form of the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing scale suitable for clinical use: the SSQ12.","OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a 12-item version of the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing scale for use in clinical research and rehabilitation settings, and provide a formula for converting scores between the full (SSQ49) and abbreviated (SSQ12) versions.DESIGN: Items were selected independently at the three centres (Eriksholm Research Centre, MRC Institute of Hearing Research, University of New England) to be representative of the complete scale. A consensus was achieved after discussion.STUDY SAMPLE: The data set (n = 1220) used for a factor analysis (Akeroyd et al, submitted) was re-analysed to compare original SSQ scores (SSQ49) with scores on the short version (SSQ12).RESULTS: A scatter-plot of SSQ12 scores against SSQ49 scores showed that SSQ12 score was about 0.6 of a scale point lower than the SSQ49 (0-10 scale) in the re-analysis of the Akeroyd et al data. SSQ12 scores lay on a slightly steeper slope than scores on the SSQ49.CONCLUSIONS: The SSQ12 provides similar results to SSQ49 in a large clinical research sample. The slightly lower average SSQ12 score and the slightly steeper slope reflect the composition of this short form relative to the SSQ49."
"23479544","Audition assessment using the NIH Toolbox.","The NIH Toolbox project has assembled measurement tools to assess a wide range of human perception and ability across the lifespan. As part of this initiative, a small but comprehensive battery of auditory tests has been assembled. The main tool of this battery, pure-tone thresholds, measures the ability of people to hear at specific frequencies. Pure-tone thresholds have long been considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; of auditory testing, and are normally obtained in a clinical setting by highly trained audiologists. For the purposes of the Toolbox project, an automated procedure (NIH Toolbox Threshold Hearing Test) was developed that allows nonspecialists to administer the test reliably. Three supplemental auditory tests are also included in the Toolbox auditory test battery: assessment of middle-ear function (tympanometry), speech perception in noise (the NIH Toolbox Words-in-Noise Test), and self-assessment of hearing impairment (the NIH Toolbox Hearing Handicap Inventory Ages 18-64 and the NIH Toolbox Hearing Handicap Inventory Ages 64+). Tympanometry can help differentiate conductive from sensorineural pathology. The NIH Toolbox Words-in-Noise Test measures a listener's ability to perceive words in noisy situations. This ability is not necessarily predicted by a person's pure-tone thresholds; some people with normal hearing have difficulty extracting meaning from speech sounds heard in a noisy context. The NIH Toolbox Hearing Handicap Inventory focuses on how a person's perceived hearing status affects daily life. The test was constructed to include emotional and social/situational subscales, with specific questions about how hearing impairment may affect one's emotional state or limit participation in specific activities. The 4 auditory tests included in the Toolbox auditory test battery cover a range of auditory abilities and provide a snapshot of a participant's auditory capacity."

This diagnosis should be considered early in military primary care in those with objective hearing loss on audiogram where there has been no exposure to significant noise."
"23279836","Reduced audiovisual integration in synesthesia--evidence from bimodal speech perception.","Recent research suggests synesthesia as a result of a hypersensitive multimodal binding mechanism. To address the question whether multimodal integration is altered in synesthetes in general, grapheme-colour and auditory-visual synesthetes were investigated using speech-related stimulation in two behavioural experiments. First, we used the McGurk illusion to test the strength and number of illusory perceptions in synesthesia. In a second step, we analysed the gain in speech perception coming from seen articulatory movements under acoustically noisy conditions. We used disyllabic nouns as stimulation and varied signal-to-noise ratio of the auditory stream presented concurrently to a matching video of the speaker. We hypothesized that if synesthesia is due to a general hyperbinding mechanism this group of subjects should be more susceptible to McGurk illusions and profit more from the visual information during audiovisual speech perception. The results indicate that there are differences between synesthetes and controls concerning multisensory integration--but in the opposite direction as hypothesized. Synesthetes showed a reduced number of illusions and had a reduced gain in comprehension by viewing matching articulatory movements in comparison to control subjects. Our results indicate that rather than having a hypersensitive binding mechanism, synesthetes show weaker integration of vision and audition."
"25480085","Auditory sensitivity of seals and sea lions in complex listening scenarios.","Standard audiometric data, such as audiograms and critical ratios, are often used to inform marine mammal noise-exposure criteria. However, these measurements are obtained using simple, artificial stimuli-i.e., pure tones and flat-spectrum noise-while natural sounds typically have more complex structure. In this study, detection thresholds for complex signals were measured in (I) quiet and (II) masked conditions for one California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) and one harbor seal (Phoca vitulina). In Experiment I, detection thresholds in quiet conditions were obtained for complex signals designed to isolate three common features of natural sounds: Frequency modulation, amplitude modulation, and harmonic structure. In Experiment II, detection thresholds were obtained for the same complex signals embedded in two types of masking noise: Synthetic flat-spectrum noise and recorded shipping noise. To evaluate how accurately standard hearing data predict detection of complex sounds, the results of Experiments I and II were compared to predictions based on subject audiograms and critical ratios combined with a basic hearing model. Both subjects exhibited greater-than-predicted sensitivity to harmonic signals in quiet and masked conditions, as well as to frequency-modulated signals in masked conditions. These differences indicate that the complex features of naturally occurring sounds enhance detectability relative to simple stimuli. "
"25324086","Rapid estimation of high-parameter auditory-filter shapes.","A Bayesian adaptive procedure, the quick-auditory-filter (qAF) procedure, was used to estimate auditory-filter shapes that were asymmetric about their peaks. In three experiments, listeners who were naive to psychoacoustic experiments detected a fixed-level, pure-tone target presented with a spectrally notched noise masker. The qAF procedure adaptively manipulated the masker spectrum level and the position of the masker notch, which was optimized for the efficient estimation of the five parameters of an auditory-filter model. Experiment I demonstrated that the qAF procedure provided a convergent estimate of the auditory-filter shape at 2<U+2009>kHz within 150 to 200 trials (approximately 15<U+2009>min to complete) and, for a majority of listeners, excellent test-retest reliability. In experiment II, asymmetric auditory filters were estimated for target frequencies of 1 and 4 kHz and target levels of 30 and 50<U+2009>dB sound pressure level. The estimated filter shapes were generally consistent with published norms, especially at the low target level. It is known that the auditory-filter estimates are narrower for forward masking than simultaneous masking due to peripheral suppression, a result replicated in experiment III using fewer than 200 qAF trials.

The classification is designed for the practical application in the clinical work of otorhinolaryngologists, occupational pathologists, and medico-social experts who must practice the identical approaches at all stages of the preliminary and final diagnostics of occupational ear diseases, competence assurance, and social maintenance for the subjects presenting with hearing disorders. The authors emphasize the importance of taking account of presbyacusis characteristics at the stage of pre-nosological changes of the hearing function in the subjects exposed to strong occupational noise, i.e. prior to the appearance of the «signs of noise influence on the organs of hearing&quot;. Such an approach makes it possible to eliminate the discrepancies in drawing conclusion about the presence of presbyacusis or &quot;signs of noise influence on the organs of hearing&quot;. "
"25229622","Relation between speech-in-noise threshold, hearing loss and cognition from 40-69 years of age.","BACKGROUND: Healthy hearing depends on sensitive ears and adequate brain processing. Essential aspects of both hearing and cognition decline with advancing age, but it is largely unknown how one influences the other. The current standard measure of hearing, the pure-tone audiogram is not very cognitively demanding and does not predict well the most important yet challenging use of hearing, listening to speech in noisy environments. We analysed data from UK Biobank that asked 40-69 year olds about their hearing, and assessed their ability on tests of speech-in-noise hearing and cognition.METHODS AND FINDINGS: About half a million volunteers were recruited through NHS registers. Respondents completed 'whole-body' testing in purpose-designed, community-based test centres across the UK. Objective hearing (spoken digit recognition in noise) and cognitive (reasoning, memory, processing speed) data were analysed using logistic and multiple regression methods. Speech hearing in noise declined exponentially with age for both sexes from about 50 years, differing from previous audiogram data that showed a more linear decline from &lt;40 years for men, and consistently less hearing loss for women. The decline in speech-in-noise hearing was especially dramatic among those with lower cognitive scores. Decreasing cognitive ability and increasing age were both independently associated with decreasing ability to hear speech-in-noise (0.70 and 0.89 dB, respectively) among the population studied. Men subjectively reported up to 60% higher rates of difficulty hearing than women. Workplace noise history associated with difficulty in both subjective hearing and objective speech hearing in noise. Leisure noise history was associated with subjective, but not with objective difficulty hearing.CONCLUSIONS: Older people have declining cognitive processing ability associated with reduced ability to hear speech in noise, measured by recognition of recorded spoken digits. Subjective reports of hearing difficulty generally show a higher prevalence than objective measures, suggesting that current objective methods could be extended further."
"25209043","Hearing and loud music exposure in a group of adolescents at the ages of 14-15 and retested at 17-18.","Young people expose themselves to potentially damaging loud sounds while leisure activities and noise induced hearing loss is diagnosed in increasing number of adolescents. Hearing and music exposure in a group of adolescents of a technical high school was assessed at the ages of: 14-15 (test) and 17-18 (retest). The aims of the current study were: (1) To compare the auditory function between test and retest; (2) to compare the musical exposure levels during recreational activities in test and retest; (3) to compare the auditory function with the musical exposure along time in a subgroup of adolescents. The participants in the test were 172 male; in the retest, this number was reduced to 59. At the test and retest the conventional and extended high frequency audiometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) and recreational habits questionnaire were performed. In the test, hearing threshold levels (HTLs) were classified as: Normal (Group 1), slightly shifted (Group 2), and significantly shifted (Group 3); the Musical General Exposure (MGE), categorized in: Low, moderate, high, and very high exposure. The results revealed a significant difference (P &lt; 0.0001) between test and retest in the HTL and global amplitude of TEOAEs in Group 1, showing an increase of the HTL and a decrease TEOAEs amplitude. A subgroup of adolescents, with normal hearing and low exposure to music in the test, showed an increase of the HTL according with the categories of MGE in the retest. To implement educational programs for assessing hearing function, ear vulnerability and to promote hearing health, would be advisable. "

The aims of the current study are: (1) To detect early noise-induced hearing loss among adolescents and establish its relationship with their participation in musical recreational activities and (2) to determine sound immission levels in nightclubs and personal music players (PMPs). The participants consisted in 172 14-15 years old adolescents from a technical high school. Conventional and extended high frequency audiometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions and questionnaire on recreational habits were administered. Hearing threshold levels (HTLs) were classified as: normal (Group 1), slightly shifted (Group 2), and significantly shifted (Group 3). The musical general exposure (MGE), from participation in recreational musical activities, was categorized in low, moderate, and high exposure. The results revealed an increase of HTL in Group 2 compared with Group 1 (P &lt; 0.01), in Group 3 compared with Group 2 (P &lt; 0.05) only in extended high frequency range, in Group 3 compared with Group 1 (P &lt; 0.01). Besides, a decrease in mean global amplitude, reproducibility and in frequencies amplitude in Group 2 compared with Group 1 (P &lt; 0.05) and in Group 3 compared with Group 1 (P &lt; 0.05). A significant difference (P &lt; 0.05) was found in Group 1's HTL between low and high exposure, showing higher HTL in high exposure. The sound immission measured in nightclubs (107.8-112.2) dBA and PMPs (82.9-104.6) dBA revealed sound levels risky for hearing health according to exposure times. It demonstrates the need to implement preventive and hearing health promoting actions in adolescents. "

The aim of this study was to compare the protective effect of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and ginseng on protection of NIHL in textile workers exposed to continuous noise in daily working. In this study, 48 participants were randomly allocated to three groups; Group I received NAC 1200 mg/day, Group II received ginseng 200 mg/day, and Group III (control group) received no supplement. Pure tone audiometry and high frequency audiometry were performed preshift before and after 14 days (on day 15). Linear regression analysis results showed reduced noise-induced temporary threshold shift (TTS) for NAC and ginseng groups at 4, 6 and 16 kHz (P &lt; 0.001) in both ears. Furthermore, the protective effects were more prominent in NAC than ginseng. Our results show that NAC and ginseng can reduce noise induced TTS in workers exposed to occupational noise. Further studies are needed to prove antioxidants benefits in hearing conservation programs. "
"24508146","Pro-social ultrasonic communication in rats: insights from playback studies.","Rodent ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) serve as situation-dependent affective signals and convey important communicative functions. In the rat, three major USV types exist: (I) 40-kHz USV, which are emitted by pups during social isolation; (II) 22-kHz USV, which are produced by juvenile and adult rats in aversive situations, including social defeat; and (III) 50-kHz USV, which are uttered by juvenile and adult rats in appetitive situations, including rough-and-tumble play. Here, evidence for a communicative function of 50-kHz USV is reviewed, focusing on findings obtained in the recently developed 50-kHz USV radial maze playback paradigm. Up to now, the following five acoustic stimuli were tested in this paradigm: (A) natural 50-kHz USV, (B) natural 22-kHz USV, (C) artificial 50-kHz sine wave tones, (D) artificial time- and amplitude-matched white noise, and (E) background noise. All studies using the 50-kHz USV radial maze playback paradigm indicate that 50-kHz USV serve a pro-social affiliative function as social contact calls. While playback of the different kinds of acoustic stimuli used so far elicited distinct behavioral response patterns, 50-kHz USV consistently led to social approach behavior in the recipient, indicating that pro-social ultrasonic communication can be studied in a reliable and highly standardized manner by means of the 50-kHz USV radial maze playback paradigm. This appears to be particularly relevant for rodent models of neurodevelopmental disorders, as there is a tremendous need for reliable behavioral assays with face validity to social communication deficits seen in autism and schizophrenia in order to study underlying genetic and neurobiological alterations.

"24498000","Phenotypic characteristics of hyperacusis in tinnitus.","BACKGROUND: Many people with tinnitus also suffer from hyperacusis. Both clinical and basic scientific data indicate an overlap in pathophysiologic mechanisms. In order to further elucidate the interplay between tinnitus and hyperacusis we compared clinical and demographic characteristics of tinnitus patients with and without hyperacusis by analyzing a large sample from an international tinnitus patient database.MATERIALS: The default dataset import [November 1(st), 2012] from the Tinnitus Research Initiative [TRI] Database was used for analyses. Hyperacusis was defined by the question &quot;Do sounds cause you pain or physical discomfort?&quot; of the Tinnitus Sample Case History Questionnaire. Patients who answered this question with &quot;yes&quot; were contrasted with &quot;no&quot;-responders with respect to 41 variables.RESULTS: 935 [55%] out of 1713 patients were characterized as hyperacusis patients. Hyperacusis in tinnitus was associated with younger age, higher tinnitus-related, mental and general distress; and higher rates of pain disorders and vertigo. In relation to objective audiological assessment patients with hyperacusis rated their subjective hearing function worse than those without hyperacusis. Similarly the tinnitus pitch was rated higher by hyperacusis patients in relation to the audiometrically determined tinnitus pitch. Among patients with tinnitus and hyperacusis the tinnitus was more frequently modulated by external noise and somatic maneuvers, i.e., exposure to environmental sounds and head and neck movements change the tinnitus percept.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the comorbidity of hyperacusis is a useful criterion for defining a sub-type of tinnitus which is characterized by greater need of treatment. The higher sensitivity to auditory, somatosensory and vestibular input confirms the notion of an overactivation of an unspecific hypervigilance network in tinnitus patients with hyperacusis."
"24427551","Assessment of auditory and psychosocial handicap associated with unilateral hearing loss among Indian patients.","In order to assess psychosocial and auditory handicap in Indian patients with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (USNHL), a prospective study was conducted on 50 adults with USNHL in the ENT Outpatient clinic of a tertiary care centre. The hearing handicap inventory for adults (HHIA) as well as speech in noise and sound localization tests were administered to patients with USNHL. An equal number of age-matched, normal controls also underwent the speech and sound localization tests. The results showed that HHIA scores ranged from 0 to 60 (mean 20.7). Most patients (84.8 %) had either mild to moderate or no handicap. Emotional subscale scores were higher than social subscale scores (p = 0.01). When the effect of sociodemographic factors on HHIA scores was analysed, educated individuals were found to have higher social subscale scores (p = 0.04). Age, sex, side and duration of hearing loss, occupation and income did not affect HHIA scores. Speech in noise and sound localization were significantly poorer in cases compared to controls (p &lt; 0.001). About 75 % of patients refused a rehabilitative device. We conclude that USNHL in Indian adults does not usually produce severe handicap. When present, the handicap is more emotional than social. USNHL significantly affects sound localization and speech in noise. Yet, affected patients seldom seek a rehabilitative device. "
"24389047","There's more than one way to scan a cat: imaging cat auditory cortex with high-field fMRI using continuous or sparse sampling.","When conducting auditory investigations using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), there are inherent potential confounds that need to be considered. Traditional continuous fMRI acquisition methods produce sounds &gt;90 dB which compete with stimuli or produce neural activation masking evoked activity. Sparse scanning methods insert a period of reduced MRI-related noise, between image acquisitions, in which a stimulus can be presented without competition. In this study, we compared sparse and continuous scanning methods to identify the optimal approach to investigate acoustically evoked cortical, thalamic and midbrain activity in the cat. Using a 7 T magnet, we presented broadband noise, 10 kHz tones, or 0.5 kHz tones in a block design, interleaved with blocks in which no stimulus was presented. Continuous scanning resulted in larger clusters of activation and more peak voxels within the auditory cortex. However, no significant activation was observed within the thalamus. Also, there was no significant difference found, between continuous or sparse scanning, in activations of midbrain structures. Higher magnitude activations were identified in auditory cortex compared to the midbrain using both continuous and sparse scanning. These results indicate that continuous scanning is the preferred method for investigations of auditory cortex in the cat using fMRI. Also, choice of method for future investigations of midbrain activity should be driven by other experimental factors, such as stimulus intensity and task performance during scanning."
"26707982","Communication masking in marine mammals: A review and research strategy.","Underwater noise, whether of natural or anthropogenic origin, has the ability to interfere with the way in which marine mammals receive acoustic signals (i.e., for communication, social interaction, foraging, navigation, etc.). This phenomenon, termed auditory masking, has been well studied in humans and terrestrial vertebrates (in particular birds), but less so in marine mammals. Anthropogenic underwater noise seems to be increasing in parts of the world's oceans and concerns about associated bioacoustic effects, including masking, are growing. In this article, we review our understanding of masking in marine mammals, summarise data on marine mammal hearing as they relate to masking (including audiograms, critical ratios, critical bandwidths, and auditory integration times), discuss masking release processes of receivers (including comodulation masking release and spatial release from masking) and anti-masking strategies of signalers (e.g. Lombard effect), and set a research framework for improved assessment of potential masking in marine mammals.

"26168952","Early-life exposure to noise reduces mPFC astrocyte numbers and T-maze alternation/discrimination task performance in adult male rats.","In this experiment, we evaluated the long-term effects of noise by assessing both astrocyte changes in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and mPFC-related alternation/discrimination tasks. Twenty-one-day-old male rats were exposed during a period of 15 days to a standardized rats' audiogram-fitted adaptation of a human noisy environment. We measured serum corticosterone (CORT) levels at the end of the exposure and periodically registered body weight gain. In order to evaluate the long-term effects of this exposure, we assessed the rats' performance on the T-maze apparatus 3 months later. Astrocyte numbers and proliferative changes in mPFC were also evaluated at this stage. We found that environmental noise (EN) exposure significantly increased serum CORT levels and negatively affected the body weight gain curve. Accordingly, enduring effects of noise were demonstrated on mPFC. The ability to solve alternation/discrimination tasks was reduced, as well as the number of astroglial cells. We also found reduced cytogenesis among the mPFC areas evaluated. Our results support the idea that early exposure to environmental stressors may have long-lasting consequences affecting complex cognitive processes. These results also suggest that glial changes may become an important element behind the cognitive and morphological alterations accompanying the PFC changes seen in some stress-related pathologies.

"26164105","Self-Reported Hearing Difficulties Among Adults With Normal Audiograms: The Beaver Dam Offspring Study.","OBJECTIVE: Clinicians encounter patients who report experiencing hearing difficulty (HD) even when audiometric thresholds fall within normal limits. When there is no evidence of audiometric hearing loss, it generates debate over possible biomedical and psychosocial etiologies. It is possible that self-reported HDs relate to variables within and/or outside the scope of audiology. The purpose of this study is to identify how often, on a population basis, people with normal audiometric thresholds self-report HD and to identify factors associated with such HDs.DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional investigation of participants in the Beaver Dam Offspring Study. HD was defined as a self-reported HD on a four-item scale despite having pure-tone audiometric thresholds within normal limits (&lt;20 dB HL0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 kHz bilaterally, at each frequency). Distortion product otoacoustic emissions and word-recognition performance in quiet and with competing messages were also analyzed. In addition to hearing assessments, relevant factors such as sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, medical history, health-related quality of life, and symptoms of neurological disorders were also examined as possible risk factors. The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression was used to probe symptoms associated with depression, and the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 mental score was used to quantify psychological stress and social and role disability due to emotional problems. The Visual Function Questionnaire-25 and contrast sensitivity test were used to query vision difficulties.RESULTS: Of the 2783 participants, 686 participants had normal audiometric thresholds. An additional grouping variable was created based on the available scores of HD (four self-report questions), which reduced the total dataset to n = 682 (age range, 21-67 years). The percentage of individuals with normal audiometric thresholds who self-reported HD was 12.0% (82 of 682). The prevalence in the entire cohort was therefore 2.9% (82 of 2783). Performance on audiological tests (distortion product otoacoustic emissions and word-recognition tests) did not differ between the group self-reporting HD and the group reporting no HD. A multivariable model controlling for age and sex identified the following risk factors for HD: lower incomes (odds ratio [OR] $50,000+ = 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.30-1.00), noise exposure through loud hobbies (OR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.15-1.90), or firearms (OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.04-4.16). People reporting HD were more likely to have seen a doctor for hearing loss (OR = 12.93, 95% CI = 3.86-43.33) and report symptoms associated with depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression [OR = 2.39, 95% CI = 1.03-5.54]), vision difficulties (Visual Function Questionnaire-25 [OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.89-0.97]), and neuropathy (e.g., numbness, tingling, and loss of sensation [OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.14-3.44]).CONCLUSIONS: The authors used a population approach to identify the prevalence and risk factors associated with self-reported HD among people who perform within normal limits on common clinical tests of auditory function. The percentage of individuals with normal audiometric thresholds who self-reported HD was 12.0%, resulting in an overall prevalence of 2.9%. Auditory and nonauditory risk factors were identified, therefore suggesting that future directions aimed at assessing, preventing, and managing these types of HDs might benefit from information outside the traditional scope of audiology."
"25994710","Expectations and speech intelligibility.","Socio-indexical cues and paralinguistic information are often beneficial to speech processing as this information assists listeners in parsing the speech stream. Associations that particular populations speak in a certain speech style can, however, make it such that socio-indexical cues have a cost. In this study, native speakers of Canadian English who identify as Chinese Canadian and White Canadian read sentences that were presented to listeners in noise. Half of the sentences were presented with a visual-prime in the form of a photo of the speaker and half were presented in control trials with fixation crosses. Sentences produced by Chinese Canadians showed an intelligibility cost in the face-prime condition, whereas sentences produced by White Canadians did not. In an accentedness rating task, listeners rated White Canadians as less accented in the face-prime trials, but Chinese Canadians showed no such change in perceived accentedness. These results suggest a misalignment between an expected and an observed speech signal for the face-prime trials, which indicates that social information about a speaker can trigger linguistic associations that come with processing benefits and costs.

"25994708","Effect of the division between early and late reflections on intelligibility of ideal binary-masked speech.","The ideal binary mask (IBM) that was originally defined in anechoic conditions has been found to yield substantial improvements in speech intelligibility in noise. The IBM has recently been extended to reverberant conditions where the direct sound and early reflections of target speech are regarded as the desired signal. It is of great interest to know how the division between early and late reflections impacts on the intelligibility of the IBM-processed noisy reverberant speech. In this present study, the division between early and late reflections in three rooms was first determined by four typical estimation approaches and then used to compute the IBMs in reverberant conditions. The IBMs were then applied to the noisy reverberant mixture signal for segregating the desired signal, and the segregated signal was further presented to normal-hearing listeners for word recognition. Results showed that the IBMs with different divisions between early and late reflections provided substantial improvements in speech intelligibility over the unprocessed mixture signals in all conditions tested, and there were small, but statistically significant, differences in speech intelligibility between the different IBMs in some conditions tested.

Objectives Evaluate the vestibular behavior in military band musicians. Methods A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed. Nineteen musicians with ages ranging from 21 to 46 years were evaluated (average<U+2009>=<U+2009>33.7 years and standard deviation<U+2009>=<U+2009>7.2 years). They underwent anamnesis and vestibular and otolaryngologic evaluation through vectoelectronystagmography. Results The most evident otoneurologic symptoms in the anamnesis were tinnitus (84.2%), hearing difficulties (47.3%), dizziness (36.8%), headache (26.3%), intolerance to intense sounds (21.0%), and earache (15.7%). Seven musicians (37.0%) showed vestibular abnormality, which occurred in the caloric test. The abnormality was more prevalent in the peripheral vestibular system, and there was a predominance of irritative peripheral vestibular disorders. Conclusion The alteration in vestibular exam occurred in the caloric test (37.0%). There were changes in the prevalence of peripheral vestibular system with a predominance of irritative vestibular dysfunction. Dizziness was the most significant symptom for the vestibular test in correlation with neurotologic symptoms. The present study made it possible to verify the importance of the labyrinthine test, which demonstrates that this population should be better studied because the systematic exposure to high sound pressure levels may cause major vestibular alterations.

"25906840","Total leisure noise exposure and its association with hearing loss among adolescents.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate total leisure noise exposure among adolescents and to assess its association with hearing.DESIGN: Based on self-reported time spent on 19 leisure activities and associated mean sound pressure levels reported in the literature, total leisure noise exposure was evaluated and compared to noise at work limits (&gt; 85 dB(A) = hazardous) in a cross-sectional survey. Tympanometry and pure-tone audiometry was performed in sound isolated rooms.STUDY SAMPLE: The study sample consists of 2143 pupils attending grade nine in any school in a German city 2009-2011 (mean age: 15.4 years; range: 13-19 years). Audiometric data were available for 1837 (85.8%) pupils (53.9% girls).RESULTS: 41.9% of the 2143 adolescents who had provided self-reported data on leisure activities associated with noise exposure were estimated to be hazardously exposed to leisure time noise. The interaction of gender with total leisure time noise exposure was not significant. No association between leisure time noise exposure and audiometric notches could be detected.CONCLUSION: While hearing loss seems seldom in this age group, a high proportion of adolescents aged 15-16 years are exposed to noise levels during leisure time bearing long-term risks of hearing loss."
"25762661","Auditory properties in the parabelt regions of the superior temporal gyrus in the awake macaque monkey: an initial survey.","The superior temporal gyrus (STG) is on the inferior-lateral brain surface near the external ear. In macaques, 2/3 of the STG is occupied by an auditory cortical region, the &quot;parabelt,&quot; which is part of a network of inferior temporal areas subserving communication and social cognition as well as object recognition and other functions. However, due to its location beneath the squamous temporal bone and temporalis muscle, the STG, like other inferior temporal regions, has been a challenging target for physiological studies in awake-behaving macaques. We designed a new procedure for implanting recording chambers to provide direct access to the STG, allowing us to evaluate neuronal properties and their topography across the full extent of the STG in awake-behaving macaques. Initial surveys of the STG have yielded several new findings. Unexpectedly, STG sites in monkeys that were listening passively responded to tones with magnitudes comparable to those of responses to 1/3 octave band-pass noise. Mapping results showed longer response latencies in more rostral sites and possible tonotopic patterns parallel to core and belt areas, suggesting the reversal of gradients between caudal and rostral parabelt areas. These results will help further exploration of parabelt areas. "

Audiometric data (hearing sensitivity and speech in noise) were collected.STUDY SAMPLE: Data were obtained from 123 adults with hearing impairment: 73 reported current hearing-aid use, 81 reported current hearing assistance technology use.RESULTS: In both analyses, device users had more difficulty understanding speech in background noise, had poor hearing in both their better and worse hearing ears, and perceived more consequences of hearing impairment in their everyday lives (both emotionally and socially) than non-hearing-aid users. Discriminant analyses showed that the social consequences of hearing impairment and the better ear hearing best classified hearing aid users from non-users but social consequences and worse ear hearing best classified hearing assistance technology users from non-users.CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life measurements and speech-in-noise assessments provide useful clinical information. Hearing-impaired adults in New Zealand who use hearing aids also tend to use hearing assistance technology, which has important clinical implications."
"27991459","Early indication of noise-induced hearing loss from PMP use in adolescents: A cross-sectional analysis.","CONTEXT: Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) may indicate preclinical noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in adolescents from unsafe personal music player (PMP) use.AIMS: The objective, therefore, was to observe preclinical signs of NIHL in 9th grade adolescents with clinically normal hearing by comparing DPOAE signals between different levels of A-weighted equivalent PMP exposure.SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Subjects were recruited from all secondary-level schools located in the city of Regensburg, Germany during two academic years 2009/2010 and 2010/2011.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A-weighted equivalent sound pressure levels (SPLs) for a 40-hour work week (LAeq,40h) were estimated from questionnaire responses on output and duration of PMP use of the previous week. Subjects were then categorized into four levels of exposure: &lt;80, 80-85, &gt;85 to &lt;90, and =90 A-weighted Decibel [dB(A)]. DPOAE signals were collected by trained audiological staff, applying a standard optimized protocol, at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of the University Hospital Regensburg.STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Mean DPOAE signals were compared between levels by unpaired t test. Novel linear regression models adjusting for other leisure noise exposures and with outcome variables DPoutcome and 4 kilo Hertz (kHz) DPOAEs estimated effects between levels.RESULTS: A total of 1468 subjects (56% female, mostly aged 15 or 16 years) were available for analysis. Comparison of DPOAE means by PMP exposure typically showed no greater than 1<U+2009>dB difference between groups. In fact, comparisons between =90 dB(A) and &lt;80 dB(A) presented the least differences in magnitude. Both DPoutcome and 4<U+2009>kHz linear regression models presented a weak association with the 4-level PMP exposure variable. An expected dose-response to PMP exposure was not observed in any analyses.CONCLUSIONS: DPOAE signal strength alone cannot indicate preclinical NIHL in adolescents."
"27913314","Audiologic characteristics in a sample of recently-separated military Veterans: The Noise Outcomes in Servicemembers Epidemiology Study (NOISE Study).","Military Service Members are often exposed to high levels of occupational noise, solvents, and other exposures that can be damaging to the auditory system. Little is known about hearing loss and how it progresses in Veterans following military service. This epidemiology study is designed to evaluate and monitor a cohort of Veterans for 20 years or more to determine how hearing loss changes over time and how those changes are related to noise exposure and other ototoxic exposures encountered during military service. Data reported here are from baseline assessments of the first 100 study participants (84 males; 16 females; mean age 33.5 years; SD 8.8; range 21-58). Each participant was asked to complete a comprehensive audiologic examination and self-report questionnaires regarding sociodemographic characteristics, noise and solvent exposures, health conditions common among post-deployment Veterans, and the social and emotional consequences of hearing loss. For this relatively young cohort, 29% exhibited hearing loss, defined as average hearing threshold &gt;20 dB HL in the conventional audiometric range. Forty-two percent exhibited hearing loss in the extended-high-frequency audiometric range using the same criterion (average hearing threshold &gt;20 dB HL). Certain factors were found to be associated with poorer hearing in both conventional and extended-high-frequency ranges, including age, type of military branch, years of military service, number of military deployments, noise exposure, tinnitus, and a positive screen for post-traumatic stress disorder. Although the majority of participants had hearing within normal limits, 27% reported a self-perceived mild/moderate hearing handicap and 14% reported a significant handicap. Further research is needed to identify a cause for this discrepancy in audiologic results versus self-report. The information obtained from this longitudinal study could be used in future resource planning with the goal of preventing, as much as possible, the development of hearing loss during military service, and the exacerbation of prevalent hearing loss after military service and over Veterans' lifetimes."

"27445661","Decreased Speech-In-Noise Understanding in Young Adults with Tinnitus.","OBJECTIVES: Young people are often exposed to high music levels which make them more at risk to develop noise-induced symptoms such as hearing loss, hyperacusis, and tinnitus of which the latter is the symptom perceived the most by young adults. Although, subclinical neural damage was demonstrated in animal experiments, the human correlate remains under debate. Controversy exists on the underlying condition of young adults with normal hearing thresholds and noise-induced tinnitus (NIT) due to leisure noise. The present study aimed to assess differences in audiological characteristics between noise-exposed adolescents with and without NIT.METHODS: A group of 87 young adults with a history of recreational noise exposure was investigated by use of the following tests: otoscopy, impedance measurements, pure-tone audiometry including high-frequencies, transient and distortion product otoacoustic emissions, speech-in-noise testing with continuous and modulated noise (amplitude-modulated by 15 Hz), auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and questionnaires.Nineteen students reported NIT due to recreational noise exposure, and their measures were compared to the non-tinnitus subjects.RESULTS: No significant differences between tinnitus and non-tinnitus subjects could be found for hearing thresholds, otoacoustic emissions, and ABR results.Tinnitus subjects had significantly worse speech reception in noise compared to non-tinnitus subjects for sentences embedded in steady-state noise (mean speech reception threshold (SRT) scores, respectively -5.77 and -6.90 dB SNR; p = 0.025) as well as for sentences embedded in 15 Hz AM-noise (mean SRT scores, respectively -13.04 and -15.17 dB SNR; p = 0.013). In both groups speech reception was significantly improved during AM-15 Hz noise compared to the steady-state noise condition (p &lt; 0.001). However, the modulation masking release was not affected by the presence of NIT.CONCLUSIONS: Young adults with and without NIT did not differ regarding audiometry, OAE, and ABR.However, tinnitus patients showed decreased speech-in-noise reception. The results are discussed in the light of previous findings suggestion NIT may occur in the absence of measurable peripheral damage as reflected in speech-in-noise deficits in tinnitus subjects."

The Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) had been conducted in two phases: (1) at the time of fitting without an HA (situation A) and with an HA (situation B); (2) with an HA 90 days after fitting (situation C).STUDY SAMPLE: Thirty subjects with sensorineural hearing loss at high frequencies.RESULTS: By using an analysis of variance and the Tukey's test comparing the three HINT situations in quiet and noisy environments, an improvement has been observed after the HA fitting. The results of the WHOQOL-BREF have showed an improvement in the quality of life after the HA fitting (paired t-test). The relationship between speech perception and quality of life before the HA fitting indicated a significant relationship between speech recognition in noisy environments and in the domain of social relations after the HA fitting (Pearson's correlation coefficient).CONCLUSIONS: The auditory stimulation has improved speech perception and the quality of life of individuals."

We investigated this study to determine the effect of hyperlipidemia on NIHL. In a case-control study, 144 workers who exposed to continuous noise more than 85 dBA (88-89 dBA) from a textile factory in Tehran were examined. Serum Blood test results as index for dyslipidemi, were collected and audiometry tests were carried out to analyze the association of hyperlipidemian and NIHL. The mean ±SD of Cholesterol level for NIHL and control were 188.19 (28.46) and 159.00 (26.66) mg/dL respectively. Also the mean ±SD of Triglyceride level for NIHL and control were 203.75 (53.92) and 105.00 (30.50) mg/dL consecutively. After adjusting odds ratio (OR) for NIHL, only hypertriglyceridemia had association with NIHL. (aOR = 1.07; 95 % CI 1.04-1.10), and there wasn't any relation between hypercholestomia and NIHL (aOR = 1.02; 95 % CI 0.99-1.05). Workers with hypertriglyceridemia are at increased risk for NIHL. In factories with elevated noise levels, besides hearing conservation programs, attention to blood serum level of workers and healthy diet are proposed to help in preserving hearing threshold. "
"27174521","Alterations in gray matter volume due to unilateral hearing loss.","Although extensive research on neural plasticity resulting from hearing deprivation has been conducted, the direct influence of compromised audition on the auditory cortex and the potential impact of long durations of incomplete sensory stimulation on the adult cortex are still not fully understood. In this study, using voxel-based morphometry, we evaluated gray matter (GM) volume changes that may be associated with reduced hearing ability and the duration of hearing impairment in 42 unilateral hearing loss (UHL) patients with acoustic neuromas compared to 24 normal controls. We found significant GM volume increases in the somatosensory and motor systems and GM volume decreases in the auditory (i.e., Heschl's gyrus) and visual systems (i.e., the calcarine cortex) in UHL patients. The GM volume decreases in the primary auditory cortex (i.e., superior temporal gyrus and Heschl's gyrus) correlated with reduced hearing ability. Meanwhile, the GM volume decreases in structures involving high-level cognitive control functions (i.e., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex) correlated positively with hearing loss duration. Our findings demonstrated that the severity and duration of UHL may contribute to the dissociated morphology of auditory and high-level neural structures, providing insight into the brain's plasticity related to chronic, persistent partial sensory loss."

"27021038","Auditory Temporal Processing Deficits in Chronic Stroke: A Comparison of Brain Damage Lateralization Effect.","BACKGROUND: There have been a few reports about the effects of chronic stroke on auditory temporal processing abilities and no reports regarding the effects of brain damage lateralization on these abilities. Our study was performed on 2 groups of chronic stroke patients to compare the effects of hemispheric lateralization of brain damage and of age on auditory temporal processing.METHODS: Seventy persons with normal hearing, including 25 normal controls, 25 stroke patients with damage to the right brain, and 20 stroke patients with damage to the left brain, without aphasia and with an age range of 31-71 years were studied. A gap-in-noise (GIN) test and a duration pattern test (DPT) were conducted for each participant.RESULTS: Significant differences were found between the 3 groups for GIN threshold, overall GIN percent score, and DPT percent score in both ears (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.001). For all stroke patients, performance in both GIN and DPT was poorer in the ear contralateral to the damaged hemisphere, which was significant in DPT and in 2 measures of GIN (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>.046). Advanced age had a negative relationship with temporal processing abilities for all 3 groups.CONCLUSIONS: In cases of confirmed left- or right-side stroke involving auditory cerebrum damage, poorer auditory temporal processing is associated with the ear contralateral to the damaged cerebral hemisphere. Replication of our results and the use of GIN and DPT tests for the early diagnosis of auditory processing deficits and for monitoring the effects of aural rehabilitation interventions are recommended."
"26869944","Auditory Perceptual Learning in Adults with and without Age-Related Hearing Loss.","Introduction : Speech recognition in adverse listening conditions becomes more difficult as we age, particularly for individuals with age-related hearing loss (ARHL). Whether these difficulties can be eased with training remains debated, because it is not clear whether the outcomes are sufficiently general to be of use outside of the training context. The aim of the current study was to compare training-induced learning and generalization between normal-hearing older adults and those with ARHL. Methods : Fifty-six listeners (60-72 y/o), 35 participants with ARHL, and 21 normal hearing adults participated in the study. The study design was a cross over design with three groups (immediate-training, delayed-training, and no-training group). Trained participants received 13 sessions of home-based auditory training over the course of 4 weeks. Three adverse listening conditions were targeted: (1) Speech-in-noise, (2) time compressed speech, and (3) competing speakers, and the outcomes of training were compared between normal and ARHL groups. Pre- and post-test sessions were completed by all participants. Outcome measures included tests on all of the trained conditions as well as on a series of untrained conditions designed to assess the transfer of learning to other speech and non-speech conditions. Results : Significant improvements on all trained conditions were observed in both ARHL and normal-hearing groups over the course of training. Normal hearing participants learned more than participants with ARHL in the speech-in-noise condition, but showed similar patterns of learning in the other conditions. Greater pre- to post-test changes were observed in trained than in untrained listeners on all trained conditions. In addition, the ability of trained listeners from the ARHL group to discriminate minimally different pseudowords in noise also improved with training. Conclusions : ARHL did not preclude auditory perceptual learning but there was little generalization to untrained conditions. We suggest that most training-related changes occurred at higher level task-specific cognitive processes in both groups. However, these were enhanced by high quality perceptual representations in the normal-hearing group. In contrast, some training-related changes have also occurred at the level of phonemic representations in the ARHL group, consistent with an interaction between bottom-up and top-down processes. "
"26723318","Psychometric functions for sentence recognition in sinusoidally amplitude-modulated noises.","Listeners' speech reception is better when speech is masked by a modulated masker compared to an unmodulated masker with the same long-term root-mean-square level. It has been suggested that listeners take advantage of brief periods of quiescence in a modulated masker to extract speech information. Two experiments examined the contribution of such &quot;dip-listening&quot; models. The first experiment estimated psychometric functions for speech intelligibility using sentences masked by sinusoidally modulated and unmodulated speech-shaped noises and the second experiment estimated detection thresholds for a tone pip added at the central dip in the masker. Modulation rates ranging from 1 to 64<U+2009>Hz were tested. In experiment 1 the slopes of the psychometric functions were shallower for lower modulation rates and the pattern of speech reception thresholds as a function of modulation rate was nonmonotonic with a minimum near 16<U+2009>Hz. In contrast, the detection thresholds from experiment 2 increased monotonically with modulation rate. The results suggest that the benefits of listening to speech in temporally fluctuating maskers cannot be solely ascribed to the temporal acuity of the auditory system."
"28556652","[The use of speech audiometry in the practice of the geriatric center].","The aim of the study was to evaluate a new test of speech audiometry while examining aged patients. 32 aged listeners from 60 to 88 years old were examined: 20 hearing aid (HA) users and 12 patients with normal hearing thresholds and mild cognitive impairment according to the results of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE). The speech audiometry consisted of the traditional polysyllabic words discrimination test and a new speech test with motor responses (Verbal Tasks and Motor Responses - VTMR); in both tests the signal was presented in background noise (polyphony) in free field. All listeners performed the VTMR test significantly better than the polysyllabic words discrimination test. In the group of hearing impaired patients the mean result in VTMR test was 73,2±29,2 % without HA and 88,6±20,5 % with it, in traditional test - 34,8±20,9 % without HA and 56±18,4 % with it. All patients of the group with normal hearing and mild cognitive impairment performed the VTMR test with 100 % result, their speech discrimination score in traditional test was 88±12 %. In the practice of the geriatric center the use of both the traditional speech audiometry and the new speech test with motor responses seems to be reasonable, that allows examining the auditory function in patients with significant deterioration of speech intelligibility or cognitive impairment."

"28164934","Epidemiology and Risk Factors for Leisure Noise-Induced Hearing Damage in Flemish Young Adults.","CONTEXT: Young people regularly expose themselves to leisure noise and are at risk for acquiring hearing damage.AIMS: The objective of this study was to compare young adults' hearing status in relation to sociodemographic variables, leisure noise exposure and attitudes and beliefs towards noise.SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A self-administered questionnaire regarding hearing, the amount of leisure noise exposure and attitudes towards noise and hearing protection as well as an audiological test battery were completed. Five hundred and seventeen subjects between 18 and 30 years were included.SUBJECT AND METHODS: Hearing was evaluated using conventional audiometry, transient evoked and distortion product otoacoustic emissions. On the basis of their hearing status, participants were categorised into normal hearing, sub-clinical or clinical hearing loss.STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Independent samples t-tests, chi-square tests and multiple regression models were used to evaluate the relation between groups based on hearing status, sociodemographics, leisure noise and attitudes towards noise.RESULTS: Age was significantly related to hearing status. Although, the subjects in this study frequently participated in leisure activities, no significant associations between leisure noise exposure and hearing status could be detected. No relation with subjects' attitudes or the use of hearing protection devices was found.CONCLUSIONS: This study could not demonstrate clinically significant leisure noise-induced hearing damage, which may lead to more non-protective behaviour. However, the effects of leisure noise may become noticeable over a long-term use since age was found to be related with sub-clinical hearing loss. Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effects of noise exposure."
