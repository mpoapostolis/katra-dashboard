"11119634","Audiometric notch as a sign of noise induced hearing loss.","OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relation between different types of exposure to noise and a classic sign of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL), the audiometric notch.METHODS: The study sample had exposure to both continuous and impulse noise and was drawn from a population of electrical transmission workers. Audiograms, taken as part of a hearing conservation programme, were read by three clinicians experienced in the assessment of NIHL. Working independently and using their clinical judgment, they were asked to identify localised increases in the threshold of hearing (audiometric notches) which they would attribute to noise, had a suitable history of exposure been elicited. Prevalent cases of NIHL were identified by the presence of a notch in either ear. Risk factors for NIHL were assessed by a questionnaire which sought information about exposure to air blast circuit breaker noise; firearms; explosions, and continuous noise. The odds of exposure to these factors in those with and without hearing loss were calculated, and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated by logistic regression.RESULTS: Of the 648 questionnaires sent out 357 were returned, a response rate of 55%. Of these, at least two out of the three assessors identified 175 (49%) people with a notch at any audiometric frequency. There was no association between these cases and the NIHL risk factors identified by the questionnaire, but a further frequency specific analysis showed a small proportion of people (15 (4%)) with notches at 4 kHz who had the expected associations with exposure to noise and a significant OR for firearms of 4.25 (95% CI 1.28 to 14.1). The much larger proportion of people with 6 kHz notches (110 (31%)) did not show these associations.CONCLUSIONS: To diagnose NIHL it is important to elicit a detailed and accurate history of exposure to noise: although the notch at 4 kHz is a well established clinical sign and may be valuable in confirming the diagnosis, the 6 kHz notch is variable and of limited importance."
"11103349","[Bilateral acoustic trauma after air bag inflation].","Airbag inflation is associated with a loud noise. This very short noise has a peak amplitude of 170 dB sound pressure level and can make otologic injuries. We report a case of acoustic trauma after airbag inflation. The 24-year-old man has hearing loss both side in the 3000- to 6000-Hz range and in the deep-frequency. The possibility of acoustic trauma from airbag noise are probably much more common and need more attention in the clinic."

"10971532","Guidelines on the diagnosis of noise-induced hearing loss for medicolegal purposes.","These guidelines aim to assist in the diagnosis of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in medicolegal settings. The task is to distinguish between possibility and probability, the legal criterion being 'more probable than not'. It is argued that the amount of NIHL needed to qualify for that diagnosis is that which is reliably measurable and identifiable on the audiogram. The three main requirements for the diagnosis of NIHL are defined: R1, high-frequency hearing impairment; R2, potentially hazardous amount of noise exposure; R3, identifiable high-frequency audiometric notch or bulge. Four modifying factors also need consideration: MF1, the clinical picture; MF2, compatibility with age and noise exposure; MF3, Robinson's criteria for other causation; MF4, complications such as asymmetry, mixed disorder and conductive hearing impairment."
"10923909","The role of magnesium in the susceptibility of soldiers to noise-induced hearing loss.","A number of studies have demonstrated that magnesium, administered prophylactically, can reduce the amount of hearing loss resulting from noise exposure. This study explored the possible role of naturally occurring body magnesium concentration in susceptibility of soldiers to noise-induced hearing loss. Participants were 68 adult males who had received extensive noise exposure over several years as a result of training with weapon systems. Each participant provided a pure-tone audiogram, blood sample, and noise-exposure history. A variety of pure-tone indices was correlated with serum magnesium levels as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. No significant correlations were observed between any audiometric index and body magnesium. The results of this study, therefore, do not support the hypothesis that there is a strong association between naturally occurring body magnesium and susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss."
"10894416","Influence of age and presbyacusis on DPOAE.","The influence of presbyacusis on distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) was studied on 180 ears of 96 normal-hearing subjects. The subjects' ages were distributed equally and ranged from 14 to 82 years. It was shown that there is a highly significant decrease in DPOAE amplitudes during the ageing process. By means of special statistical procedures, such as partial correlation and multiple regression, it was proved that the main reason for this is deterioration in pure-tone thresholds. However, other age-related effects were determined and were also found to lead to a further decrease in DPOAE amplitudes. The latter might be due to middle ear alterations in elderly people. Knowledge of the influence of presbyacusis on DPOAE is important if DPOAEs are to be used in expert assessment of inner ear disorders, for example, occupational noise-induced hearing loss."
"10891783","Hearing status of French youth aged from 18 to 24 years in 1997: a cross-sectional epidemiological study in the selection centres of the army in Vincennes and Lyon.","BACKGROUND: It is currently thought that young adults are at increasing risk of exposure to deleterious sources of noise. To test this possibility we have assessed hearing status of young French men aged between 18 and 24 years in 1997 and study risk factors of deafness in a cross-sectional epidemiological study at selection centres for aptitudes to National Service.METHODS: During the time of the study, 1208 subjects were examined. For each subject, data of an interview, an otoscopy and audiograms were collected. We compared hearing thresholds between subjects with different noise exposures and we determined risk factors of deafness in this population.RESULTS: The prevalence of hearing loss was 9% at medium frequencies (0.5-2 kHz) and 15% at high frequencies (4-8 kHz).We found that 60% of the subjects were regularly exposed to at least one source of loud noise. Acoustic trauma (6%) mostly explained hearing losses. Repeated episodes of otitis media in childhood (17%) also emerged as an important risk factor apparently due to increased sensitivity to noise. In subjects with antecedent of otitis media, hearing impairments were significant in personal stereo users (&gt;1 hour per day) (p&lt;0.001), in those who went to discos and rock concerts (&gt;2 times per month) (p=0.01) and in those who worked in noisy places (p=0.01). In contrast, in subjects without antecedent of otitis, we found no difference in hearing thresholds between noise exposed and non noise exposed subjects.CONCLUSIONS: Loud sound exposure is a true risk factor of early deafness in subjects that had had repeated episodes of otitis media in childhood. This study stresses the need for both prevention policies and information of health professionals and practitioners."
"10776364","Recreational firearm use and hearing loss.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the relation between recreational firearm use and high-frequency hearing loss in a population of older adults.DESIGN: Cross-sectional, population-based cohort study.SETTING: The midwestern community of Beaver Dam, Wis.PARTICIPANTS: A population-based sample of 3753 participants (83% of those eligible), aged 48 to 92 years, participated in the baseline phase of the Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study.INTERVENTION: None.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime and past year self-reported firearm use during target shooting and hunting were assessed by interview. Hearing thresholds were measured by pure-tone audiometry.RESULTS: After age and other factors were adjusted for, men (n = 1538) who had ever regularly engaged in target shooting (odds ratio, 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.19) or who had done so in the past year (odds ratio, 2.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-3.46) were more likely to have a marked high-frequency hearing loss than those who had not. Risk of having a marked high-frequency hearing loss increased 7% for every 5 years the men had hunted (odds ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.12). Thirty-eight percent of the target shooters and 95% of the hunters reported never wearing hearing protection while shooting in the past year.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that use of recreational firearms is associated with marked high-frequency hearing loss in men. There is a need for further education of users of recreational firearms regarding the risk of hearing impairment associated with firearm use and the availability and importance of appropriate hearing protection."

"10769565","[Multi-frequency impedance measurement and Meniere's disease. Analysis of the results of TEFLAG].","We present today our preliminary results of the TEFLAG test performed on 58 patients suffering from Meniere's disease. This test completed in 1993 has already led to a 4-stage classification of noise induced hearing losses. On the one hand, it is based on the morphological study of susceptance B curves, and on the other hand, on the study of the resonant frequency (RF) of the annular ligament of the stapes, provided by a multifrequential impedancemeter. The endolymphatic hydrops coming with the Meniere's disease practically always cohabits in the intercritical period with the decrease of the perilymphatic pressure of the scala vestibuli, which is shown in the morphology of Stage IV curves especially, and the decrease of the annular ligament rigidity. Inversely, during the vertigo or around, we mainly have stage I curves, and an increase of the stapes annular ligament resonant frequency (RF), testifying the labyrinthic hydrops, which is the physiopathological essence of the Meniere's disease."
"10737087","[Traumatic and occupational deafness].","The frequency of accidental, traumatic hearing loss is increasing due to a sometimes violently noisy environment and to the development of sports as leisure activities. The diagnosis is based on knowledge of the circumstances of the trauma and on otoscopic examination. Total audiometry localises the damage. Occupational hearing loss forms a special subset of traumatic deafness. This trauma is usually due to intense noise occurring at the work-place. It is of insidious onset, irreversibly progressive and without treatment once under way; Prevention is based on knowledge of the deleterious effects of noise and on the individual factors of the subject at risk."
"10718677","Database for a hearing conservation program.","We have developed a database and an analysis program (NoiseScan) for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The exposure data are based on the evaluation of the noise immission level, which includes duration, frequency content, and the use of, and the attenuation performance of, hearing protectors. The input data can handle an unlimited number of exposure periods. If the noise exposure level is not known, the program lists noise levels of comparable work places, and thus provides an estimate of exposure. Confounding medical factors that may contribute to NIHL, such as elevated serum cholesterol level, hypertension, and extensive use of pain killers, are collected. Combined exposure to agents that clearly contribute to NIHL, such as hand-arm vibration, tobacco smoking, use of aminoglycosides and exposure to solvents are also assessed. An unlimited number of audiograms can be stored, and all the data can be completed and edited following collection. The program gives the predicted hearing loss according to the ISO 1999 model based on total exposure. At present, our NoiseScan program (under continuous development in an EU research program) is suitable for the data collection of various risk factors. It can be used to determine whether the hearing loss is occupational in origin and to estimate the efficiency of hearing conservation measures. NoiseScan also predicts the development of hearing loss in individuals in 5-year periods. The goal is to improve and validate the rules by which single and combined risk factors contribute to HIHL, thus leading to more precise prediction of individual hearing loss, and for the evaluation of success of the hearing conservation programs."
"10628244","A study of the noise hazard to employees in local discotheques.","AIM OF STUDY: There is growing concern that amplified music in discotheques can cause hearing loss. This study attempts to evaluate the noise hazard of employees exposed to amplified music in our discotheques.METHOD: Employees comprising of disc jockeys, bartenders, waiters, cashiers and security officers of five selected discotheques were used for the study. Personal noise dosimetry was carried out on 40 employees throughout their workshift. The audiometric examination results of another 46 employees were compared with 37 subjects from a non-exposed match control group.RESULTS: The range of exposure to noise level above 85 dBA for the employees is 3.6 to 6.9 hours with a mean of 5.1 hours. All the occupational groups are exposed to noise level of at least 89 dBA Leq for their whole work shift. The discotheque group has statistically significant higher prevalence (41.9%) of early sensorineural hearing loss compared to the control group (13.5%). A higher proportion of employees in the older age group (above 30 years old) and working longer (above 1 year) suffer from hearing loss. A significant proportion of the discotheque study subjects (21%) also complained of recurrent tinnitus compared to 2.7% in the control group. The younger (&lt; 30 years) and those with shorter exposure duration (&lt; 1 year) appeared to complain of tinnitus more.CONCLUSION: The study shows that all the employees regardless of occupations are exposed to noise above the permissible level of 85 dBA Leq A high proportion of them also suffer from early sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus."
"10615655","[Acute hearing loss and tinnitus caused by amplified recreational music].","BACKGROUND: Hearing loss resulting from exposure to permanent or repeated amplified music in professional musicians and music consumers is described in literature. The risk of hearing loss does not exist only after prolonged exposure to music. Short-term exposure to very high sound levels, for example in concerts, can also cause hearing loss and tinnitus.PATIENTS: The retrospective study includes 24 patients who required rheologic therapy between 1994 and 1997 due to a music related acoustic trauma. The type, intensity, and length of music exposure as well as the distance and the position to the source of noise were examined. The type of hearing damage and its development during rheological treatment was studied by pure-tone audiometry.RESULTS: In the majority of examined patients (67%) the hearing loss developed on the basis of one-time exposure at a rock concert or pop concert, followed by hearing loss from attending discotheques (17%) or parties (12%), and music exposure from personal cassette players (4%). The majority of patients showed a maximum hearing loss of 40-60 dB (A) in a frequency between 3 kHz and 4 kHz. Pure-tone audiometry in 58% of the patients exhibited a unilateral threshold in a frequency between 3 kHz and 4 kHz combined with ipsilateral tinnitus of the same frequency. Twenty-one percent of the patients showed a symmetric bilateral threshold and tinnitus between 3 kHz and 4 kHz. In 8% there was a unilateral tinnitus, and in 13% a bilateral tinnitus without any hearing loss. All patients improved their hearing loss during rheologic treatment. Improvement in the tinnitus was only achieved in 33% of the examined cases.CONCLUSION: The risk of permanent hearing loss resulting from short-term exposure to amplified music is low compared to the risk of continuous tinnitus. Given the lack of acceptance of personal ear protectors, the risk of acute hearing damage due to amplified music could be reduced by avoiding the immediate proximity to the speakers."
"11707350","Role of free oxygen radicals in noise-related hearing impairment.","This study was aimed at defining the relationship between noise-related hearing impairment in industrial workers exposed to continuous noise. For this malondialdehyde and glutathione peroxidase were analyzed as free radical form and antioxidant form. A total of 60 patients working in the units of a hydroelectric power plant were included in the study. This experimental group was further divided into three subgroups of 20 workers, each group exposed to a different noise level. The control group consisted of 20 male volunteers employed in the Medical Centre where the study was carried out. A standard ascending/descending method was applied to the subjects of the experimental and the control groups in order to determine their hearing thresholds at seven different frequencies between 250 and 8000 Hz. Then, 10 ml blood was collected from each person to measure the malondialdehyde values in plasma and glutathione peroxidase activity in erythrocytes. Slight sensorineural hearing impairment was found in group I beginning at 4 kHz and in group II beginning at 6 kHz. Statistically significant differences were observed in group I and II when compared to the control group (P&lt;0.05). It was found that malondialdehyde levels increased in the experimental groups more than in the control groups. However, this increase was only significant in group I (P&lt;0.05). Erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase activity significantly increased in group I and II compared to the other groups (P&lt;0.05), also, the difference was significant between group I and II (P&lt;0.05). Accordingly, it is suggested that free oxygen radicals may take a role in noise-related hearing impairment."
"11692623","[An epidemiological study regarding the hearing acuity of residents in the area with high level of aircraft noise: results of hearing tests conducted in the vicinity of Kadena Air Base].","Hearing tests, primary and secondary, were conducted in two communities vicinal to Kadena US Air Base in Okinawa from May 1996 to July 1998. The noise exposure expressed in WECPNL as designated by the Defense Facilities Administration Agency ranged from 85 to 95 and above. A total of 2035 subjects aged between 25 and 69 years inclusive were considered eligible for inclusion in this study and among them 137 males and 206 females underwent the primary test. Before the test, subjects were asked about hearing difficulty, tinnitus, otological anamnesis and past experience of noise exposure at work and/or hobbies. The primary test was a pure tone audiometry using the ascending method of limits with 5 dB step at 7 test frequencies of 0.5 to 8 kHz. Forty individuals who were judged to have possible noise induced hearing loss were sent to Okinawa Chubu Hospital as subjects for the secondary test. The secondary test consisted of pure tone audiometry with 1 dB step at 9 test frequencies with the addition of 3 kHz and 6 kHz to the primary test frequencies, a Short Increment Sensitivity Index (SISI), test, tympanometry and audioscan audiometry. Based on test findings 12 subjects were considered to have noise induced hearing loss. The examiners interviewed the 12 subjects again to confirm that they had not experienced habitual or repeated intense noise exposure other than aircraft noise exposure around their homes. The geographical distribution of the subject's residences showed their proximity to the airfield, which strongly suggests that the cause of hearing loss may be exposure to aircraft noise from Kadena Air Base."
"11678172","Long-term objective and subjective audiologic consequences of closed head injury.","During a period of 5 years, a total of 47 patients, 16-60 years of age, with major closed head injury (CHI) were admitted to 2 Swedish medical centres. Seven to 11 years after injury, 25 of them (mean age 40.8 years; range 25-59 years) were evaluated using peripheral and central auditory tests, and most of them also completed 2 questionnaires concerning self-assessed hearing ability and quality of life. Twenty-two patients did not participate in the long-term follow-up tests: 15 were excluded for medical reasons and 4 did not wish to participate; an additional 2 were impossible to trace and 1 had died. As many as 68% of patients (17/25) demonstrated abnormalities on 1 or more of the audiometric tests, 14 on pure-tone audiometry (p &lt; 0.02) and/or central audiometric tests (3 on central tests only and 2 on pure-tone audiometry only). Four out of six patients with available early post-traumatic audiograms showed a significant progressive deterioration. As a group, their assessments of hearing ability and quality of life were equal to or better than those of the controls. These results may indicate that a higher priority should be given to obtaining an early audiologic evaluation of every CHI patient than is the rule today. The impact of post-traumatic progress and central lesions on social hearing at an advanced age is highlighted."

"11464397","Firefighters' hearing: a comparison with population databases from the International Standards Organization.","We investigated firefighters' hearing relative to general population data to adjust for age-expected hearing loss. For five groups of male firefighters with increasing mean ages, we compared their hearing thresholds at the 50th and 90th percentiles with normative and age- and sex-matched hearing data from the International Standards Organization (databases A and B). At the 50th percentile, from a mean age of 28 to a mean age of 53 years, relative to databases A and B, the firefighters lost an excess of 19 to 23 dB, 20 to 23 dB, and 16 to 19 dB at 3000, 4000, and 6000 Hz, respectively. At the 90th percentile, from a mean age of 28 to a mean age of 53 years, relative to databases A and B, the firefighters lost an excess of 12 to 20 dB, 38 to 44 dB, 41 to 45 dB, and 22 to 28 dB at 2000, 3000, 4000, and 6000 Hz, respectively. The results are consistent with accelerated hearing loss in excess of age-expected loss among the firefighters, especially at or above the 90th percentile."
"11463869","High-frequency (10-18 kHz) hearing thresholds: reliability, and effects of age and occupational noise exposure.","The objective was to investigate the reliability and effects of age and noise on high-frequency hearing thresholds. A cross-sectional study was used involving 187 exposed and 52 non-industrial noise-exposed subjects selected randomly from noise-exposed and non-industrial noise-exposed subjects, respectively. Each subject was tested with both conventional-frequency (0.25-8 kHz) and high-frequency (10-18 kHz) audiometry. Test-retest results showed that high-frequency audiometry (HFA) was as reliable as the conventional procedure. Although the inter-subject variation was large, the intra-subject variation was small, indicating that HFA can be used more reliably than the conventional procedure to monitor individual cases over time. Both the hearing threshold at high frequencies and the upper frequency limit deteriorated as a function of age and frequency. The exposed subjects had significantly higher hearing thresholds than the non-exposed subjects at all the high frequencies tested, the difference between the two groups being greatest at 14 kHz. Multivariate analysis indicated that age was the primary predictor and noise exposure the secondary predictor of hearing thresholds in a high frequency range (10-18 kHz). In contrast, multivariate analysis indicated the reverse order-noise exposure as the primary predictor, then age-for a conventional frequency range (0.25-8 kHz). The results of this study suggest that HFA might be used as an early indicator for noise-induced hearing loss and acoustic trauma rather than audiometry at a conventional frequency (4 kHz), particularly for younger groups."
"11398819","Noise-induced hearing loss among U.S. Air Force cryptolinguists.","BACKGROUND: Occupational noise-induced hearing loss remains epidemic in the U.S. Air Force (USAF) and aircrew members continue to be affected. This study examines noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) observed among USAF cryptolinguists that is attributable to radio noise and attempts to determine whether the current USAF Hearing Conservation Program (HCP) adequately identifies NIHL.METHODS: Audiograms from 120 ground-based cryptolinguists were examined. Comparisons were made between 1998 audiograms and either the reference audiogram or the enlistment audiogram. To determine HCP effectiveness, results were compared with the USAF standard of 3% or fewer permanent threshold shifts (PTS) per year.RESULTS: Some 13.3% of the cryptolinguists experienced standard threshold shifts (STS) between their enlistment audiogram and their initial occupational (reference) audiogram; 9.2% experienced STS in 1998 as compared with their initial enlistment audiogram but only 6 of the 11 (54%) were detectable using the reference audiogram as the baseline. The frequency pattern of changes in hearing thresholds was characteristic for NIHL.CONCLUSIONS: The NIHL that occurs among cryptolinguists prior to performance of the reference audiogram, and the hearing threshold shifts that occur between the enlistment audiogram and the reference audiogram, may obscure future hearing loss in the population. The incidence of PTS appeared to exceed 3% when the enlistment audiogram was used. While this result was not significantly different from 3%, sample size limitations and data accuracy concerns warrant that this population be closely watched in the future."

"11360697","A randomised controlled trial of screening for adult hearing loss during preventive health checks.","BACKGROUND: Prophylactic strategies to counter acquired hearing impairment may involve routine audiometric screening of asymptomatic working-age adults attending general practice for regular health checks.AIM: To evaluate the effect of adult hearing screening on subsequent noise exposure and hearing.DESIGN OF STUDY: A randomised controlled population-based study of health checks and health discussions in general practice.SETTING: The project was initiated in the district of Ebeltoft, Aarhus county, Denmark.METHOD: Intervention group participants' hearing thresholds were determined audiometrically at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 kHz in each ear. Participants were advised to get their ears checked if the average hearing loss exceeded 20 dB hearing level (dBHL) in either ear. Noise avoidance was emphasised when thresholds exceeded 25 dBHL bilaterally at 4 kHz. Follow-up included questionnaires and audiometry.RESULTS: Hearing loss was observed among 18.9% of the study sample at baseline. At the five-year follow-up we recorded no significant differences between the control and the intervention groups regarding subjective or objective hearing, or exposure to occupational noise. However, there was a tendency towards reduction in exposure to leisure noise among intervention participants (P = 0.045). Approximately 20% reported hearing problems; 16.5% reported tinnitus-related complaints; 0.8% used hearing aids; 35.0% reported frequent noise exposure; and occluding wax was suspected in 2.1%.CONCLUSION: Preventive health checks with audiometry did not significantly affect hearing, but leisure noise exposure tended to become less frequent. The poor effect may be ascribed to inadequate audiological counselling or a higher priority to other advice, e.g. on cardiovascular risk or lifestyle."
"11351289","The effects of noise on the vestibular system.","PURPOSE: Subjects with noise-induced hearing loss sometimes also complain about balance disorders, but reports of clinical series that give contradictory results are highly controversial. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of intense noise on the vestibular labyrinth, both in subjects with symmetrical hearing loss and in subjects with asymmetrical loss, and to examine the correlation between the subjects' complaints and the results of the vestibular function tests.METHODS: A total of 258 male military personnel, heavily exposed to various intense noises, were included in the study. They were divided into 2 groups according to their hearing; 134 had a symmetrical high-tone hearing loss, and 124 had asymmetrical losses. Each group was divided into 2 subgroups according to the presence or absence of vestibular complaints. All of the subjects underwent a complete audiological and electronystagmographic evaluation.RESULTS: We found that vestibular damage caused by intense noise exposure might be expressed clinically in subjects with asymmetrical hearing loss. There was a strong correlation between the subjects' complaints and the results of the vestibular function tests. There was no correlation between the severity of the hearing loss and the vestibular symptomatology and pathology.CONCLUSIONS: Subjects exposed to intense noise may have evidence of vestibular pathology only when there is an asymmetrical hearing loss. Whenever hearing loss is symmetrical, an equal damage to the vestibular system of both ears is most probably responsible for the absence of abnormal findings on the vestibular function tests. The results of this study have important medicolegal implications for individuals exposed to intense noises."
"11330914","Hearing assessment of classical orchestral musicians.","Pure-tone audiometry was performed on 140 classical orchestral musicians employed at the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra and the Gothenburg Opera in Sweden. This report is based on the results from hearing threshold measurements, presented as median audiograms according to gender, age group and instrument group. The results did not show severe hearing losses that could be attributed to exposure to musical noise. However, the study reflects the subjects' present hearing ability status and does not give an answer to the question of future hearing dysfunction. Female musicians were shown to have significantly better hearing thresholds in the high-frequency area than did male musicians. Furthermore, the median pure-tone hearing thresholds for the male musicians displayed a notch configuration at 6 kHz in the left ear, similar that of to noise-induced hearing loss. A small, but in general not significant, difference was detected when comparing the median hearing thresholds between each instrument group. Percussion and woodwind players displayed slightly worse hearing thresholds than did other musicians. Players of large string instruments had the best hearing threshold values. When comparing age groups and gender it was noted that the median hearing thresholds were stable and within 20 dB HL up to the age group of 40-49 years for both females and males."
"11324845","High-frequency (8 to 16 kHz) reference thresholds and intrasubject threshold variability relative to ototoxicity criteria using a Sennheiser HDA 200 earphone.","OBJECTIVE: The first purpose of this study was to determine high-frequency (8 to 16 kHz) thresholds for standardizing reference equivalent threshold sound pressure levels (RETSPLs) for a Sennheiser HDA 200 earphone. The second and perhaps more important purpose of this study was to determine whether repeated high-frequency thresholds using a Sennheiser HDA 200 earphone had a lower intrasubject threshold variability than the ASHA 1994 significant threshold shift criteria for ototoxicity.DESIGN: High-frequency thresholds (8 to 16 kHz) were obtained for 100 (50 male, 50 female) normally hearing (0.25 to 8 kHz) young adults (mean age of 21.2 yr) in four separate test sessions using a Sennheiser HDA 200 earphone.RESULTS: The mean and median high-frequency thresholds were similar for each test session and increased as frequency increased. At each frequency, the high-frequency thresholds were not significantly (p &gt; 0.05) different for gender, test ear, or test session. The median thresholds at each frequency were similar to the 1998 interim ISO RETSPLs; however, large standard deviations and wide threshold distributions indicated very high intersubject threshold variability, especially at 14 and 16 kHz. Threshold repeatability was determined by finding the threshold differences between each possible test session comparison (N = 6). About 98% of all of the threshold differences were within a clinically acceptable range of +/-10 dB from 8 to 14 kHz. The threshold differences between each subject's second, third, and fourth minus their first test session were also found to determine whether intrasubject threshold variability was less than the ASHA 1994 criteria for determining a significant threshold shift due to ototoxicity. The results indicated a false-positive rate of 0% for a threshold shift &gt; or = 20 dB at any frequency and a false-positive rate of 2% for a threshold shift &gt;10 dB at two consecutive frequencies.CONCLUSIONS: This study verified that the output of high-frequency audiometers at 0 dB HL using Sennheiser HDA 200 earphones should equal the 1998 interim ISO RETSPLs from 8 to 16 kHz. Further, because the differences between repeated thresholds were well within +/-10 dB and had an extremely low false-positive rate in reference to the ASHA 1994 criteria for a significant threshold shift due to ototoxicity, a Sennheiser HDA 200 earphone can be used for serial monitoring to determine whether significant high-frequency threshold shifts have occurred for patients receiving potentially ototoxic drug therapy."

The symptoms of this patient were painful itching skinlesions in his face, unilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.RESULTS: The first described patient had a clinical and radiological provable fracture of his nasal bone with a frontal impression. The facial skin of the other patient was etched by the filling gas of the airbags. He was also suffering from an acoustic trauma. These cases are compared to other cases found in the literature.CONCLUSIONS: Oto-rhino-laryngological injuries can be caused by airbag deployment, especially by bursting airbags. Beside of outward injuries like dermatological hurts and fractures of the facial skeleton also more serious and life-threatening traumata can occur with damage of the cervical spine and upper airway. Moreover otologic handicaps like temporary or permanent hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, otalgia and tympanic membrane perforations are possible consequences."

"11314916","The human temporary threshold shift after exposure to 60 minutes' noise in an aerobics class.","The potential hazard of noise to hearing is well documented. However, there are some experiences of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) that are not so well-known, for example the effects of leisure noise, and in particular, leisure noise experienced during an aerobics class. A preliminary study of the noise level in aerobics classes in the Manchester region was carried out and their mean noise level was found to be 89.6 dB(A) (+/-4.7 dB(A)). Pure tone thresholds in the audible frequency range were obtained from 28 young adult volunteers (mean age 21 years; standard deviation (SD) 2.3 years) and 14 subjects (the 'exposure' group) were then invited to join (but not participate in) an aerobics class (mean noise level 91.8 dB(A) (+/-1.5 dB(A)) for 60 minutes. The noise levels in the aerobics class were monitored throughout the 60 minutes and the subjects did not stray from a small marked area (2 m2). Subjects' hearing thresholds were obtained for a second time, beginning within 2 minutes of the cessation of the noise, and any temporary threshold shifts (TTS) were noted. A second group of 14 subjects (the control group) was invited for a second audiogram after at least 60 minutes, during which time subjects were not exposed to any noise. The data obtained here were analysed and of the 14 subjects in the exposure group all had significant TTS at all frequencies except 1,000 Hz. Subjects in the control group, who had not experienced any noise, showed significantly reduced hearing thresholds (all frequencies; p&gt;0.02), showing evidence of a possible practice effect with audiometric testing."
"11297719","Effects of a 2- to 4-week course of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on neuropsychologic functioning, electroencephalogram, and auditory threshold in depressed patients.","BACKGROUND: The safety of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has only previously been formally studied in volunteers receiving a single session of stimulation or in a small number of depressed subjects receiving a 2-week treatment course. This study examined safety issues in depressed subjects receiving up to 4 weeks of rTMS. Efficacy results from this study have been previously reported.METHODS: Eighteen subjects with DSM-IV major depression participated in a 2-week, parallel, double-blind, sham-controlled study of rTMS treatment. Twelve subjects then went on to receive 4 weeks active rTMS in an open follow-up. We examined the effects of rTMS on neuropsychologic function (up to 4 weeks), auditory threshold (up to 6 weeks exposure to rTMS noise), and an electroencephalogram (after 2 weeks). Data were analyzed by repeated measures analysis.RESULTS: There were trends for improvement in neuropsychologic performance, probably due to practice effects. No mean changes in auditory threshold occurred, but two patients showed mild high-frequency hearing loss after several weeks of rTMS. Electroencephalograms in two patients, one of whom had sham stimulation, showed minor abnormality.CONCLUSIONS: No significant mean deficits were demonstrated in this cohort. Overall, rTMS for up to 4 weeks is safe, but individual results suggest caution and the need for further investigation of the safety of several weeks of rTMS."
"11296936","Association of leisure-time noise exposure and hearing loss.","The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of noisy leisure activities with hearing loss. Participants (n=3571) were examined in a population-based study of age-related hearing loss conducted in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. Hearing thresholds were determined by audiometry. Hearing loss was defined as the pure-tone average of the frequencies 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 Hz greater than 25 dB HL in either ear. Information regarding exposure to leisure-time noise was obtained by interview. After adjusting for potential confounders, individuals who engaged in leisure activities with average sound levels greater than 90 dBA were significantly more likely to have a hearing loss than participants who did not engage in noisy leisure activities (OR=1.11, 95 per cent CI=1.01-1.22). Individuals who engaged in woodworking were 30 per cent more likely to have a hearing loss than those who had never done woodworking. There was a 6 per cent increased risk of hearing loss for each 5-year period of participation. Health care professionals should consider counseling their patients who engage in noisy leisure activities about the risk of noise-induced hearing loss."

Annually 300 cases are compensated for noise induced hearing loss at a national level. This may indicate that the current national hearing protection strategy, which relies on noise reduction only, is insufficient. By audiometric screening early hearing loss will be detected and further progression may be halted. This paper reviews the methods of continuous audiometric screening of noise exposed worker populations. Reliability and validity are discussed, and an overview of quality assurance programmes is given. It is concluded that a national hearing conservation program should be implemented in Denmark."
"11257914","Noise-induced hearing loss among textile workers in Lagos metropolis.","A cross-sectional sample of 204 textile workers was selected randomly from all sections (including the non-production areas), and was initially screened to exclude subjects with pathological middle ear as well as those currently working in sections classified as non-noise but who had been exposed to excessive noise in the past. A total of 17 workers were thus excluded leaving 187 who were then assessed by means of air-conduction and bone-conduction audiograms obtained by the use of a manual (medicor-SA 3L), pure-tone audiometer. All audiometric tests were preceded by an otological examination to rule out the presence of any significant aural pathological conditions. The subjects were divided into 3 groups, based on the noise levels observed at their worksites using a Bruel and Kjaer type 2225 (integrating) sound level meter viz: the noise-exposed group (noise levels &gt; 90 dBA); the less-noise-exposed group (noise levels 85-90 dBA); and the non-noise-exposed group (noise levels &lt; 85 dBA). A comparative analysis of the data on hearing threshold levels of the 3 groups showed that the noise-exposed group had significantly (P &lt; 0.05) elevated hearing threshold levels at all frequencies and in each age group, although the maximal threshold shifts were observed at the 4000 Hz frequency. Also, the hearing threshold levels for the noise-exposed group increased with the duration of noise exposure. The study clearly showed the deleterious effects of uncontrolled occupational noise exposure on unprotected workers. A very high prevalence rate of noise-induced hearing loss (79.8%) was recorded for the noise-exposed group. The less-noise-exposed group recorded a comparatively low figure of 11.3%. The weaving section alone recorded the highest prevalence rate of 84.5%, followed very closely by the spinning section with 71.0%. The lowest prevalence rate (2.9%) was recorded for the administrative staff."

"11240317","Prognosis of acute acoustic trauma: a retrospective study using multiple logistic regression analysis.","OBJECTIVE: The prognosis for acute acoustic trauma (AAT) is difficult to predict. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used in this study to determine which factors were most strongly related to outcome for patients with AAT.METHODS: The study group was comprised of 52 patients (52 ears). Separate analyses were performed on the no change and partial recovery groups, and on the no change and full recovery groups. The following eight factors were examined as explanatory variables, age; number of days before the start of treatment; use of earplugs; drug therapy (adrenocortical hormones, low molecular weight dextrans, and vitamin B12), mean hearing levels at 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz (pure tone average, PTA), and mean hearing levels at 4 and 8 kHz (high tone average, HTA).RESULTS: Factors determined to be most strongly related to outcome were the number of days before the start of treatment, PTA, and HTA. No significant relation to outcome was determined for the five following factors, age; use of earplugs; and drug therapy (adrenocortical hormones, low molecular weight dextrans, and vitamin B12).CONCLUSION: Our results will increase the ability to prognosticate the outcome for AAT."
"11223278","Effects of underwater noise on auditory sensitivity of a cyprinid fish.","The ability of a fish to interpret acoustic information in its environment is crucial for its survival. Thus, it is important to understand how underwater noise affects fish hearing. In this study, the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) was used to examine: (1) the immediate effects of white noise exposure (0.3-4.0 kHz, 142 dB re: 1 microPa) on auditory thresholds and (2) recovery after exposure. Audiograms were measured using the auditory brainstem response protocol and compared to baseline audiograms of fathead minnows not exposed to noise. Immediately after exposure to 24 h of white noise, five out of the eight frequencies tested showed a significantly higher threshold compared to the baseline fish. Recovery was found to depend on both duration of noise exposure and auditory frequency. These results support the hypothesis that the auditory threshold of the fathead minnow can be altered by white noise, especially in its most sensitive hearing range (0.8-2.0 kHz), and provide evidence that these effects can be long term (&gt;14 days)."
"11209517","The effect of recreational gunfire noise on hearing in workers exposed to occupational noise.","Hearing sensitivity for an experimental group of 278 industrial workers who engaged in recreational shooting was compared with that of an age-matched control group of 278 nonshooting industrial workers to examine the effect of gunfire exposure on auditory thresholds. The influence of age and the number of unprotected gunshot exposures per year also was examined. The subjects in the experimental group completed a questionnaire to define the types of firearms used, the number of years shooting, and the number of protected and unprotected gunshot exposures per year. Results revealed that hearing sensitivity for frequencies 3.0, 4.0, and 6.0 kHz for both ears in the experimental group was an average of approximately 5 to 10 dB poorer than that of the control subjects. Although both subject groups demonstrated poorer 3.0-to-6.0-kHz hearing sensitivity for left-ear compared with right-ear listening, the degree of asymmetry between ears was greater for the experimental subjects. Older shooters had more hearing loss and greater threshold asymmetry than younger shooters, but there was no significant relationship between hearing sensitivity and the number of unprotected exposures per year. This latter finding was attributed to a fourfold increase in the number of unprotected annual exposures that were reported by younger shooters, who had inherently better hearing than did the older shooters."
"11196097","[Danger from exploding fireworks and blank firearms].","Explosive amusement and deterrent articles such as New Year's Eve cannons and rockets, toy pistols, and blank guns are not at all harmless items. Their potential dangerousness is often extremely underestimated. Two damaging mechanisms are important: during explosions, high pressures and temperatures develop and a considerable sound pressure level can be measured. If the explosion happens near the human body (intentionally or inadvertently), not only superficial lesions can occur, but also (mainly due to contact shots) serious, deep-seated tissue damage, especially in the head and neck region with its endangered sense organs such as eye and ear, the vessels and nerves supplying the brain, the speech- and voice-forming apparatus, and in particular the face, can be the consequence. Their mutilation can lead to serious and extensive interpersonalchanges. Accidents are published in the relevant otological and forensic medical papers, but nevertheless it seems important to us to point out the dangerousness of these readily available items."
"10753434","Tinnitus program at Braslia University Medical School.","Over the last 6 months, all patients seen at the otologic clinic of Braslia University Medical School answered a questionnaire designed to identify and describe the symptom of tinnitus. A total of 500 patients reported and described this symptom. They underwent physical examination, laboratory tests and audiological evaluation. In their order of frequency, presbycusis, chronic otitis media, otosclerosis, acoustic trauma, Menire's disease, ototoxicity, and vestibular schwannoma were found. Tinnitus was rated as minor in 81%, moderate in 18%, and severely disabling in 1%. Those who requested treatment for tinnitus were treated medically. Central vasodilators, vestibular suppressants, calcium channel blockers, anticholinergic drugs, anticonvulsant drugs, and gingko biloba were used with variable results. Tinnitus maskers were not used, but hearing prostheses were fitted when indicated. Treatment failed in the 1% with severe disabling tinnitus, and they were entered in a double-blind, randomized protocol for intratympanic dexamethasone injection. Under topical anesthesia, 0.2 ml of a 4-mg/ml dexamethasone solution (0.8 mg per injection) or 0.2 ml of normal saline was injected just posterior to the umbo. Patients remained supine for 20 minutes with the injected ear up and received four injections at 1-week intervals. Preliminary results are reported. Tinnitus is a very frequent symptom among our otologic patients, but most of them would not mention the symptom spontaneously, probably because for 81% it was mild. Curiously, the 5% of the severely disabling type tend to exhibit no clear cause, whereas the mild and moderate cases usually have an identifiable etiology."
"12486782","Changes over time in audiometric thresholds in a group of automobile stamping and assembly workers with a hearing conservation program.","Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) is among the 10 leading occupational diseases, afflicting between 7.4 and 10.2 million people who work in noise above 85 dBA. Although mandatory hearing conservation programs (HCPs) have been in effect since 1972, this problem persists, as hearing protectors are not consistently used by workers, or may not attenuate to manufacturer's estimates in real world conditions. In this study, information from noise and hearing protection use measurements taken at an automobile assembly plant were used to construct average lifetime noise exposure and hearing protection compliance estimates for use in modeling to predict both total hearing loss and onset of two accepted definitions of hearing loss. There were 301 males and females in this cohort; their mean age was 42.6 (7.2) years, and mean tenure was 14.3 (3.5) years. Average length of follow-up was 14.0 years. There were 16 members of this cohort who had hearing loss at the speech frequencies (defined as an average hearing level &gt; or = 25 dB at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz). In cross-sectional multivariate analyses, years of employment, male gender, and proportion of time wearing hearing protection were the factors most associated with hearing loss at the average of 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz (p &lt; 0.0001) controlling for age, transfer status (as a surrogate for previous noise exposure), race, and lifetime average noise exposure. The most consistent predictor of hearing loss in both univariate and multivariate analyses was percentage of time having used hearing protection during the workers' tenure."
"12474408","[Hearing disorders among private farmers in Poland].","The studies of the state of hearing were conducted among a selected group of 128 farmers, aged 28-65 years with employment ranging from 11 to 40 years. The study design covered physical laryngologic examinations, detailed otologic medical history and proper audiometric tests (air and bone conduction). The results of the study showed that the highest mean values of hearing loss remained mostly within two high frequencies of 4 and 6 kHz and were 34.9-39.7 d B. These frequencies are typical of acoustic trauma. A highly statistically significant correlation (p &lt; 0.001) was observed between hearing loss and age (r = 0.32-0.53 for 3-8 kHz), while a slightly weaker correlation was noted between hearing loss and employment duration (r = 0.20-0.27 for 3-8 kHz; p &lt; 0.01). The mean values of hearing loss obtained among farmers were considerably enhanced, compared to the control group (42 people aged 29-59 years), the difference being very high statistically (p &lt; 0.001). The studies of the state of private farmers' hearing clearly confirm the hypothesis that an excessive exposure to noise present in the farming equipment, is the major cause of the decreased hearing among farmers."
"12433419","Linear and nonlinear transient evoked otoacoustic emissions in humans exposed to noise.","Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) have been analyzed in a population of 134 ears, divided into three classes: (1) nonexposed ears in bilaterally normal hearing subjects, (2) audiometrically normal ears of subjects exposed to noise and affected by unilateral high-frequency (f&gt;3 kHz) hearing loss in the contralateral ear, and (3) the contralateral impaired ears of the exposed subjects. The statistical distributions of global and spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were analyzed. TEOAEs were recorded both in the linear and nonlinear acquisition mode to evaluate the effectiveness of two standard averaging techniques with respect to their sensitivity to the early effects of noise exposure. Good discrimination between nonexposed and exposed ears was obtained using either the linear or the nonlinear mode. Despite its intrinsically higher SNR, the linear mode is not more sensitive than the nonlinear mode for this purpose because it is not possible to find a window for effectively cancelling the linear artifact while keeping a suitable sensitivity to the short-latency high-frequency aspect of the response. Moreover, with respect to another measurable parameter, the TEOAE latency, good discrimination is obtained only by using the nonlinear mode because, again, the linear artifact masks the high-frequency TEOAE response."
"12403606","Effects of high-frequency emphasis and compression time constants on speech intelligibility in noise.","The objectives of the study were to evaluate the effect of different settings with regard to speech intelligibility in noise both objectively and subjectively and thus determine a favoured setting of compression time parameters, pre-set program (high-frequency emphasis) or combination for each individual user in a prospective study. Another objective was to evaluate the relationship between patient characteristics (e.g. slope of hearing loss) and favoured settings. In total, 38 subjects divided over five audiological centres were fitted with the Philips Spaceline D71-40 BTE digital hearing aid. Subjects were asked to compare three predefined compression algorithms with different time constants, slow (indicated by the manufacturer as AVC), intermediate (NORMAL) and fast (SYLLABIC) over two 4-week periods using the intermediate setting in both comparisons and randomizing over the fast and slow conditions. A randomization determined whether a subject started with the comfort-oriented pre-set program (AUTO) or the speech intelligibility-oriented setting with high-frequency emphasis (SPIN). In a third 4-week period, the pre-sets AUTO and SPIN were compared using the setting of the compression time constants that gave the best results during the first two periods. Comparisons were made using a standard speech-in-noise test with three types of noise: continuous speaker noise, modulated ICRA-4 noise, and car noise. The patients were also asked to fill in a Dutch translation and adaptation of the APHAB questionnaire to indicate their impression of performance. The results indicate that no compression algorithm, pre-set or combination is favoured overall. The largest improvement in speech-in-noise scores was found with syllabic compression. The advantageous effect of high-frequency emphasis after optimization of compression timing is small. The APHAB showed that users tend to prefer the SPIN setting. We found no relationship between favoured compression or pre-set and the degree or steepness of the hearing loss User preference and best performance in noise do not always coincide. Acclimatization may play a role. It could be advisable to let a user listen to a subjectively less favoured condition for at least some time if an optimal setting for speech intelligibility in noise is preferred over comfort."

A variety of tones and loudspeaker locations were used during training so that the animals would respond to a sound regardless of its frequency or location. Four groups of animals then had their left ears exposed to a 10-kHz tone at 124 or 127 dB for 0.5, 1, 2 or 4 h. They were then tested for tinnitus by comparing their performance with that of unexposed animals to determine if they behaved as if they perceived a sound when no external sound was present. The groups exposed for 2 and 4 h tested positive for tinnitus whereas those exposed for 0.5 and 1 h did not. The degree of hearing loss produced by the tone exposure was assessed using behavioral and auditory brainstem response (ABR) procedures. A partial dissociation was found between the hearing loss, as estimated by the ABR, and the results of the tinnitus test in that animals exposed for 1 h had the same hearing loss as the 2- and 4-h exposed animals, but did not test positive for tinnitus. This suggests that the positive scores on the tinnitus test were not due to hearing loss. These results are discussed along with those of previous behavioral studies of tinnitus in animals."
"12186037","Distribution of risk factors for hearing loss: implications for evaluating risk of occupational noise-induced hearing loss.","This paper presents an analysis of hearing threshold levels among 2066 white male workers employed in various U.S. industries studied in the 1968-72 NIOSH Occupational Noise and Hearing Survey (ONHS). The distribution of hearing threshold levels (HTL) is examined in relation to various risk factors (age, prior occupational noise, medical conditions) for hearing loss among a population of noise exposed and control (low noise-exposed) industrial workers. Previous analyses of a subset of these data from the ONHS focused on 1172 highly &quot;screened&quot; workers. An additional 894 male workers (609 noise-exposed and 285 controls), who were excluded for various reasons (i.e., nonoccupational noise exposure, otologic or medical conditions affecting hearing, prior occupational noise exposure) have been added to examine hearing loss in an unscreened population. Data are analyzed by age, duration of exposure, and sound level (8-h TWA) by individual test frequency. Results indicate that hearing threshold levels are higher among unscreened noise-exposed and control workers relative to screened workers. Analysis of risk factors such as nonoccupational noise exposure, medical conditions, and type of industry among unscreened controls indicated that these factors were not significantly associated with increased mean HTLs or risk of material impairment over and above what is expected due to age. Age-specific mean hearing threshold levels (and percentiles of the distribution) among the unscreened ONHS control population may be used as a comparison population of low-noise exposed white male industrial workers for evaluating the effectiveness of hearing conservation programs for workers less than 55 years of age. To make valid inferences regarding occupational noise-induced hearing loss, it is important to use hearing data from reference (control) populations that are similar with respect to the degree of subject screening, type of work force (blue vs white collar), and the distribution of other risk factors for hearing loss."
"12176760","Noise exposure and hearing loss among student employees working in university entertainment venues.","OBJECTIVES: Most studies to date on sound levels in entertainment establishments have concentrated on exposure levels for the attending public, rather than employees who may be at greater risk of hearing loss. Of particular concern are young employees. The aim of this pilot study was to (i) estimate typical sound levels in different areas where amplified music was played, (ii) measure temporary threshold shift (TTS) and (iii) estimate the dependence of hearing threshold shifts on measured noise levels.METHODS: This study focused on students working part-time (up to 16 h/week) in music bars and discotheques in a university entertainment venue. All 28 staff were invited to participate in the study. Pre- and post-exposure audiometry was used to determine hearing threshold at both high and low frequencies. Personal dosemeters and static measurements were made to assess noise levels and frequency characteristics. A questionnaire was used to determine patterns of noise exposure and attitudes to noise levels and hearing loss.RESULTS: Of the 28 student employees working in the three areas, 14 (50%) agreed to take part in the study, giving 21 pre- and post-shift audiograms. The mean personal exposure levels for security staff were higher than those of bar staff, with both groups exceeding 90 dB(A). The maximum peak pressure reading for security staff was 124 dB. Although TTS values were moderate, they were found to be highly significant at both low and high frequencies and for both ears. Twenty-nine per cent of subjects showed permanent hearing loss of more than 30 dB at either low or high frequencies. The correlation between TTS and personal exposure was higher at 4 kHz than the low and high frequencies.CONCLUSIONS: Contemporary music may be an important yet little considered contributor to total personal noise exposure, especially amongst young employees. Employees need to be better informed of risks of hearing loss and the need to report changes in hearing acuity. Suggestions are made on strategies for improving the assessment of noise exposure in entertainment venues."

A questionnaire was completed by a total of 119 workers in three garment manufacturing plants. Interviews were conducted with the occupational health nurse or safety director in each plant to determine the policy regarding hearing protection also.RESULTS: Factors that directly influenced the use of hearing protection devices were a clinical definition of health, benefits of and barriers to use of hearing protection devices, self-efficacy in the use of hearing protection devices and perceived health status (R2 =.25, p &lt;.01). An exploratory analysis allowing a direct relationship of modifying factors with the dependent variable explained additional variance in use of hearing protection devices through the contribution of situational factors (R2 =.55, p &lt;.01).CONCLUSIONS: Important factors related to Mexican American workers' use of hearing protection devices were identified to provide direction for nursing interventions.

"11903364","The Audioscan: a high frequency resolution audiometric technique and its clinical applications.","The Audioscan is a form of high definition audiometry based on iso-hearing level frequency sweeps, which was developed by Meyer-Bisch in 1990. Compared with traditional tone audiometry, it sweeps across the preset frequency range at a predetermined sweep rate and provides a continuous audiometric curve. Because the device has a maximum frequency range of 125-16 000 Hz with 64 frequencies per octave, the Audioscan method can, theoretically, give 64 times as many values as fixed-frequency audiometry, which may give greater accuracy and sensitivity. An advantage of this is its capacity to detect mild audiometric deficits such as narrow notches situated between the frequencies normally tested. These may represent very limited auditory lesions, at a stage when they cannot be detected by routine audiological methods. Thus, the Audioscan method can give not only a detailed audiometric curve, but also provide important indicators of mild auditory dysfunction. The Audioscan device (e.g. Essilor model) is commercially available for clinical purpose. It is a software-based system, which can also be used for pure tone audiometry and Bksy audiometry. This paper reviews the general aspects of the Audioscan technique and current applications for detecting auditory dysfunction. This would be valuable to provide some guidelines on the Audioscan assessment, and contribute to a clarification of the clinical application of Audioscan and facilitate further research."
"11893445","Effect of background noise on perception of English speech for Japanese listeners.","OBJECTIVES: To avoid the accidents induced by confusions of non-native speech perception in the presence of noise at work, this study examined the effect of background noise on the discrimination of English speech for Japanese listeners.METHODS: Normal hearing Japanese subjects, who have English learning experience to the level of college graduates, were tested with the CID W-22 word list in quiet settings and in the presence of white, low-frequency weighted (pink noise), or aircraft noise.RESULTS: The discrimination scores were reduced as S/N ratio decreased, and more adversely affected by background white noise than pink or aircraft noise. The individual variability of English word discrimination scores for Japanese listeners was much larger as the S/N ratio decreased. The typical confusions among phoneme were /m/, /n/, and /s/.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggested that ineffective use of speech cues and difference in composition of English phonemes from Japanese could be responsible for degraded speech discrimination of non-native speech in noise. Moreover, it was expected that Japanese workers with age related hearing loss at higher frequencies might have great difficulty in perceiving English speech sounds in the presence of noise."

Records included U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps enlisted personnel (Navy men = 51,643; Navy women = 4,184; Marine Corps men = 12,251: Marine Corps women = 554). Mean hearing thresholds were calculated for age groups (17-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, and 50 years and older), gender (male/female), and service (Navy/Marine Corps). Although hearing thresholds worsened with increasing age, as expected, Navy and Marine Corps men have worse levels than Occupational Safety and Health Administration age-corrected values throughout most of their careers, whereas women were closer to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration values. Hearing thresholds in the Navy have not improved appreciably from historical reports. Threshold variability, as revealed by standard deviations, increased with age and paralleled threshold levels. This epidemiological information suggests that hearing conservation continues to be an important force health protection issue."
"11860642","Identification of the auditory hazards of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.","The aim of this work was to determine the effect of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) on the hearing of both patients and staff members exposed to such treatment. It used different hearing screening instruments, and compared the sensitivity of these instruments for the detection of the earliest change in hearing induced by this procedure. The results of this study show that ESWL has a potentially hazardous effect on hearing. This effect is subtle, could only be detected by transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE), and is manifested in some of the subjects under study as temporary subjective hearing loss and tinnitus, reflecting a state of temporary biomechanical derangement of the outer hair cells. This effect seems to be related to the frequency of exposure to ESWL."
"11845992","Age and noise-induced hearing loss.","The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of noise, age and confounders in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Information about work exposure, the use of hearing protective devices, audiogram, environmental and biological factors was collected from 406 paper mill workers exposed to noise levels of 91-94 dB(A), 124 forest workers exposed to noise levels of 96-99 dB(A) and 176 shipyard workers exposed to noise levels 95-97 dB(A). In addition to noise exposure, we collected the following confounders: smoking habits, serum cholesterol, systolic or diastolic blood pressure and use of analgesics. Subjects were classified based on median values, into high- and low-risk groups. The confounders were a significant source of hearing loss (HL) in younger and elderly groups of subjects, serum cholesterol level being the most important. In risk analysis the confounders partly masked the effects of noise in the development of HL. For subjects with less than two confounders, occupational noise exposure determined the development of NIHL. As the number of confounders increased, the noise exposure was overruled by these factors in the development of HL. In analysis where the subjects were matched with pairs by age, exposure, blood pressure and serum cholesterol level, the elderly subjects were more susceptible to NIHL than younger subjects. Factors independently but causally related to age were important in the development of NIHL among workers exposed to noise levels below 98 dB(A)."

"11793272","[Progressive noise induced hearing loss caused by hearing AIDS, a dilemma for the worker and the expert alike].","BACKGROUND: Investigating cases of noise induced hearing loss the expert is often confronted with the situation that the hearing loss is progressive although the noise exposure has been reduced to almost non-damaging levels. Other causes such as age, hereditary deafness, head injuries, blasts, internal diseases can be excluded. Hearing aids as sources of damaging noise? By consulting the protocol of the hearing-aid acoustician and by own examinations the expert should obtain the following data: loudness level that yields best discrimination score of speech; level of discomfort for tones and speech, discrimination score that is achieved under free field condition with a speech level of 65 dB, using the hearing aids. Furthermore he should explore the circumstances under which the hearing aids are used: how many hours per day, at what occasions etc.?INTERPRETATION: It is likely that in using the hearing aids they are adjusted to emit an intensity level identical to the one yielding the optimal discrimination score. If this e. g. is 100 dB and the hearing aids are used for 2 hours per day this would be equivalent to an exposure to industrial noise of 94 dB (A) for 8 hours daily without ear protection.DISCUSSION: Among all individuals working under industrial noise exposure today only about 1 - 2 % having unusually vulnerable inner ears will suffer a noise induced hearing loss. On the other hand workers in industrial noise are accustomed to loud noise levels, usually have a raised threshold of discomfort and therefore are likely to adjust their hearing aids to such high intensities. The expert will have to decide whether in an individual case the industrial noise exposure or the use of the hearing aids is the dominant risk for further damage. The consequences in respect to the regulations of the workers' health insurance are discussed."

"11763114","Hearing loss in space.","BACKGROUND: Temporary and, in some cases, permanent hearing loss has been documented after long-duration spaceflights.METHODS: We examined all existing published data on hearing loss after space missions to characterize the losses.RESULTS: Data from Russian missions suggest that the hearing loss, when it occurs, affects mainly mid to high frequencies and that using hearing protection often might prevent the loss. Several significant questions remain about hearing loss in space. While the hearing loss has been presumed to be noise-induced, no clear link has been established between noise exposure and hearing loss during spaceflight. In one documented case of temporary hearing loss from the Shuttle-Mir program, the pattern of loss was atypical for a noise-induced loss. Continuous noise levels that have been measured on the Mir and previous space stations, while above engineering standards, are not at levels usually associated with hearing loss in ground-based studies (which have usually been limited to 8-10 h exposure periods). Attempts to measure hearing in space using threshold-based audiograms have been unsuccessful in both the American and Russian programs due to noise interference with the measurements.CONCLUSIONS: The existing data highlight the need for reliable monitoring of both hearing and noise in long-duration spaceflight."
"14689645","Noise exposure and its effect on the labyrinth, Part II.","The neurootological data of 12 patients attending our ear, nose, and throat clinic were analyzed. The patients submitted to a neurootological routine evaluation consisting of patient history recording and audiometric and equilibriometric investigations (i.e., electronystagmography). The conclusion was that many tinnitus patients--even those who had no vestibular symptoms--showed some disturbance in the vestibular tests, such as spontaneous and positional nystagmus and nystagmus alternans. Laurikainen came to the same conclusion in 1995, after examining 10 patients with sudden deafness but no vestibular complaints. It is recommended that all patients with noise exposure, sudden deafness, and tinnitus of the severe disabling type undergo a complete cochleovestibular investigation."
"14689633","Sonovestibular symptoms evaluated by computed dynamic posturography.","The investigation of stability under bilateral acoustic stimulation was undertaken in an attempt to mimic the real-life conditions of noisy environment (e.g., industry, aviation). The Tullio phenomenon evaluated by computed dynamic posturography (CDP) under acoustic stimulation is reflected in postural unsteadiness, rather than in the classic nystagmus. With such a method, the dangerous effects of noise-induced instability can be assessed and prevented. Three groups of subjects were submitted. The first (group A) included 20 patients who complained of sonovestibular symptoms (i.e., Tullio phenomenon) on the background of an inner-ear disease. The second group (B) included 20 neurootological patients without a history of Tullio phenomenon. Group C consisted of 20 patients with normal hearing, as controls. A pure-tone stimulus of 1,000 Hz at 110 dB was delivered binaurally for 20 seconds during condition 5 and condition 6 of the CDP sensory organization test. The sequence of six sensory organization conditions was performed three times with two intermissions of 15-20 minutes between the trials. The first was performed in the regular mode (quiet stance). This was followed 20 minutes by a trial carried out in quiet stance in sensory organizations tests (SOTs) 1 through 4, and with acoustic stimulation in SOT 5 and SOT 6. The last test was performed in quiet stance throughout (identical to the first trial). A significant drop in the composite equilibrium score was witnessed in group A patients upon acoustic stimulation (p &lt; .0001). This imbalance did not disappear completely until 20 minutes later when the third sensory organization trial was performed. In fact, the composite score obtained on the last SOT was still significantly worse than the baseline. Group B and the normal subjects (group C) showed no significant change in composite score. As regards the vestibular ratio score, again, group A marked a drop on stimulation with sound (p &lt; .004). This decrease contrasted once more with the other two groups. The leading sensory organization pattern was vestibular dysfunction (i.e., 40%, 10%, and 0% before acoustic stimulation in groups A, B, and C, respectively). The initial proportion of vestibular dysfunction increased on acoustic stimulation to 55% in group A, but this subsequently decreased in the third trial. The percentages of vestibular dysfunction remained constant during repeated trials in the other two groups. The positive medical history of sonovestibular symptoms was confirmed objectively by CDP with sound stimulation with a high statistical significance. This establishes the described method as a sensitive testing technique for validating the existence of the Tullio phenomenon in patients with a variety of disorders of the inner ear, especially chronic noise-induced hearing loss and acute acoustic trauma. All patients who suffered phonic trauma, chronic exposure to noise (e.g., aviation employees, industry and army personnel), or other neurootological disorders and who complain of sonovestibular symptoms should be tested for the presence of the Tullio phenomenon. This should be carried out preferably by means of CDP with acoustic stimulation for an objective corroboration of their complaint before continuing activity in a noisy environment, thus preventing dangerous loss of balance when exposed to noise."
"14689614","Cortical evoked response audiometry thresholds and neuroleptic, sedative, hypnotic drugs.","Cortical evoked response audiometry is adequate for approximating hearing threshold levels with frequency specificity when the psychoacoustic responses lack reliability and reproducibility (compensation claim). It is well-known that control of wakefulness is essential for the reliability of slow vertex responses (SVR). Therefore, sedative, hypnotic, and neuroleptic drugs are supposed to have possible adverse effects on the detection of SVR. In contrast, brainstem evoked responses (BER) have proved not to be significantly affected by therapeutic doses of these compounds. The purpose of our study was to assess the reliability of SVR-threshold definition in subjects taking neuroleptic, sedative, and hypnotic drugs. Fifteen subjects examined for occupational hearing loss at the Fund for Occupational Diseases in Brussels and regularly taking one or several of these drugs were compared with 27 comparable controls. In each subject the auditory thresholds were defined with both techniques: SVR (1, 2, and 3 kHz) and BER (clicks). A highly significant difference is observed between the two groups: In the group receiving drugs, the SVR threshold for 3 kHz is 12.1 dB (average) higher than the BER threshold, whereas in the group without drugs, the SVR threshold for 3 kHz is 7.77 dB (average) lower than the BER threshold. In the drug group, large interindividual differences are observed. It may be concluded that the use of neuroleptics, sedatives, and hypnotics renders the auditory threshold definition with SVR completely unreliable. In using SVR for medicolegal threshold definition, controlling the 3-kHz threshold with BER always is necessary."
"14665813","Impact of OSHA final rule--recording hearing loss: an analysis of an industrial audiometric dataset.","The 2003 Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Occupational Injury and Illness Recording and Reporting Final Rule changed the definition of recordable work-related hearing loss. We performed a study of the Alcoa Inc. audiometric database to evaluate the impact of this new rule. The 2003 rule increased the rate of potentially recordable hearing loss events from 0.2% to 1.6% per year. A total of 68.6% of potentially recordable cases had American Academy of Audiology/American Medical Association (AAO/AMA) hearing impairment at the time of recordability. On average, recordable loss occurred after onset of impairment, whereas the non-age-corrected 10-dB standard threshold shift (STS) usually preceded impairment. The OSHA Final Rule will significantly increase recordable cases of occupational hearing loss. The new case definition is usually accompanied by AAO/AMA hearing impairment. Other, more sensitive metrics should therefore be used for early detection and prevention of hearing loss."
"14618174","[Hearing loss caused by noise, otitis and head injuries].","BACKGROUND: Results from a recent study of the population in Nord-Trndelag County are described and estimates given of the magnitude of hearing loss associated with occupational and leisure noise exposure, recurrent ear infections and head injury.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Self reported exposure data were collected by questionnaires and hearing acuity was measured by pure tone audiometry. There were complete data from 50 132 subjects above the age of 19. Effects of various risk factors were estimated using multivariate methods.RESULTS: Noise, ear infections and head injury explained 1-6% of the variance (varying with age, sex and frequency range), apart from what could be explained by age alone (30-58%). The strongest effects were from occupational noise and impulse noise (gun blasts) among middle-aged and older men. Only moderate effects of noise could be detected among women. No effects of amplified music or use of personal stereo players could be demonstrated. There were clear effects of recurrent ear infections and head injury.INTERPRETATIONS: With the possible exception of substantial effects of recurrent ear infections and impulse noise, our results give grounds for somewhat more optimism than most previous results about risk factors for hearing loss."

NIHL was determined to be significantly more frequent in workers with blood group O.CONCLUSION: We suggest that people with blood group O are more prone to develop NIHL."
"14571650","Airbags and permanent auditory deficits. A real correlation?","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship between airbag-induced noise and individual metabolic risk factors in determining persistent hypoacusia in drivers after road accidents.METHODOLOGY: We selected 22 patients previously involved in a car accident with deployment of airbags. Patients underwent general and audiological clinical history, tonal audiometric examination, vocal audiometric examination, impedance meter examination and blood tests.RESULTS: We divided patients, according to audiometric data, into 2 groups: group A with no residual otological disturbances (6 subjects) and group B with persistent hypoacusia (16 subjects). Blood parameters were into physiological levels in all group A patients; on the contrary 12 (subgroup B1) out of 16 group B patients had altered blood levels of glucose, urea and cholesterol, with mean values of 155.8 +/- 38.6 mg/dl, 48.2 +/- 8.3 mg/dl and 250.8 +/- 28.1 mg/dl, respectively, revealing statistically significant differences in these parameters when compared with the other 4 hypoacusic cases (Sub-group B2) and with the normal subjects (Group A) (p &lt; 0.01 for glucose, p &lt; 0.05 for urea and p &lt; 0.001 for cholesterol).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the transitory otological damage due to airbag deployment: the intensity of the acoustic wave hitting the ear after airbag deployment is responsible for a temporary rise in the acoustic threshold but the persistence of an auditory deficit can be due to co-factors able to interfere with the acute acoustic trauma recovery processes through a metabolic, angiopathic, neuropathic or unknown mechanism. Moreover, also the age of the patients could affect in a significant way the recovery from the acoustic trauma."
"14558892","The influence of ageing on noise-induced hearing loss.","A lifetime of exposure to noise is likely to have negative effects on the hearing, but the interaction between noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and age-related hearing loss is difficult to determine. The most commonly accepted assumption is a simple accumulating effects of noise and ageing on the hearing. However, both a less than additive effect as well as a supraadditive effect has been proposed. Recently an interesting interaction between NIHL and age-related hearing loss has been reported (Gates et al., 2000). NIHL before old age reduces the effects of ageing at noise-associated frequencies, but accelerates the deterioration of hearing in adjacent frequencies. Findings from the longitudinal and cross-sectional gerontological and geriatric population study of 70-year-olds in Gothenburg, Sweden supports these observations. The incidence of tinnitus increases in old age, but not at the same high rate as presbyacusis. According to the gerontological and geriatric population study in Gothenburg tinnitus in old age is related more to hearing loss than to ageing. There are no simple correlations between exposure to noise during the active years and tinnitus in old age."
"14525578","Noise exposure in the orthopaedic operating theatre: a significant health hazard.","BACKGROUND: Surgeons working in orthopedic operating theatres are exposed to significant noise pollution due to the use of powered instruments. This may carry a risk of noise-induced hearing loss. The present study was designed to quantify the noise exposure experienced by surgeons and establish whether this breaches occupational health guidelines for workplace noise exposure.METHODS: A sound dosimeter was worn by the operating surgeon during three total hip replacements and two total knee replacements. A timed record of the procedures was kept concurrently. Noise levels experienced during each part of the procedure and total noise exposures were measured. Noise exposures were compared with occupational health guidelines.RESULTS: Noise exposure in total hip replacement averaged 4.5% (1.52-6.45%) of the allowed daily dose (average duration 77.28 min). Total knee replacement exposure was 5.74% (4.09-7.39%) of allowed daily exposure (average duration: 69.76 min). Maximum sound levels approached but did not exceed recommended limits of 110 dBA (108.3 dBA in total hip replacement and 107.6 dBA in total knee replacement). Transient peak sound levels exceeded maximums of 140 dB on multiple occasions during surgery.CONCLUSIONS: Overall total noise dose during orthopaedic surgery was acceptable but orthopaedic surgeons experience brief periods of noise exposure in excess of legislated guidelines. This constitutes a noise hazard and carries a significant, but unquantified risk for noise-induced hearing loss."
"14502772","Perceived and measured hearing ability in construction laborers and farmers.","BACKGROUND: Construction and farming are characterized by small independently operated enterprises; few are included in hearing loss prevention programs. This study describes perceived and measured hearing ability among construction laborers and farmers in order to further the Healthy People 2010 goal to reduce noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).METHODS: Construction laborers (n = 147) and farmers (n = 150) had screening audiograms at their workplace and a farm show, respectively. The relationship of the audiograms with a one-item measure of perceived hearing ability was explored using non-parametric statistics.RESULTS: At the 4,000 Hz frequency, indicative of NIHL, a high percentage of both groups exhibited hearing loss greater than 25 dB: laborers 53%, farmers 67%. Perceived hearing ability was significantly worse (P &lt; 0.05) for workers with a measured hearing loss. The sensitivities of perceived hearing loss compared to audiometry ranged from 0.30 to 0.72 suggesting that perceived hearing loss was not a good indicator of actual hearing loss in this sample.CONCLUSIONS: The poor relationship between perceived and actual hearing loss in this study suggests that best practice requires inclusion of audiometric screening as part of a complete hearing loss prevention program. Future development of an improved instrument to measure perceived hearing ability may be useful in assessing this dimension of hearing."
"14501543","Effectiveness of a tailored intervention to increase factory workers' use of hearing protection.","BACKGROUND: In the United States it is estimated that more than 30 million workers are exposed to harmful levels of noise on the job. When engineering or administrative controls cannot be used to reduce noise, workers should always use hearing protection devices (HPDs) when exposed to loud noise to prevent noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Previous research has shown that workers do not always use HPDs when required; therefore, it is essential that workers assume personal responsibility for preventing NIHL by increasing their use of HPDs.OBJECTIVES: This study tested the effectiveness of an individually tailored multimedia intervention to increase use of HPDs by factory workers.METHODS: A randomized controlled design was used to compare the effects of a tailored intervention (n= 446) with two other interventions (a nontailored predictor-based intervention (n= 447) and a control intervention (n= 432)) on workers' self-reported use of HPDs 6 to 18 months following the intervention.RESULTS: Only those workers receiving the tailored intervention significantly increased their use of HPDs from pretest to posttest. However, this increase significantly differed from the nontailored group but not from the control group.CONCLUSIONS: Individually-tailored interventions offer promise for changing behavior. In light of the similarity between the results for the tailored intervention and the control intervention groups, further research is needed to understand barriers to HPD use and how to maximize the benefits of individually tailored interventions in this setting."

The first obtained within 3 months and the follow-up ones between 6 and 12 months after injury. Three representative examples are given.PATIENTS: Eighty-three patients (166 ears) who reported hearing impairment after blunt neck trauma.RESULTS: Twenty of the 166 ears (12%) had normal hearing and 137 ears (81.3%) showed an acoustic trauma-like hearing impairment. Eight ears (4.8%) had a hearing loss of at least 30 dB in the speech frequencies (500-2,000 Hz) and two ears (1.2%) had additional impairment in the higher frequencies. Only one ear (0.8%) had a conductive hearing loss. No speech discrimination score was poorer than 80%. Forty-six subjects (55.4%) reported tinnitus.CONCLUSIONS: Blunt neck trauma, like whiplash injury, may cause objectively measurable hearing impairment."
"12953738","Noise induced hearing loss among industrial workers in Dar es Salaam.","OBJECTIVES: To determine whether sound in the study areas was of sufficient intensity to cause hearing loss and if so whether those exposed have been affected and to determine whether workers/employees in the study areas were aware that sound can cause hearing loss and if so whether they knew that this can be prevented by ear protection.DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.SETTING: Industrial area A and B randomly selected from among industries in Dar es Salaam.SUBJECTS: One hundred and fifty workers from area A and fifty two employees from area B.RESULTS: In both study areas the noise levels were above the safe limit of 85dB(A). In area A 28 workers and in area B eight employees had noise induced hearing loss. In area A 81.1% of the workers and in area B 85% of the employees knew that noise causes hearing loss. All workers/employees from both study areas knew that noise induced hearing loss could be prevented by some form of ear protection.CONCLUSION: Workers/Employees exposed to noise above 85dB(A) will eventually develop hearing loss. Workers/employees are aware of this hazard. There is therefore a need to educate those exposed on how best to protect their ears from the hazard and provide them with protective gear."
"12941983","[Findings of standard and high-frequency audiometry in workers exposed to occupational noise for long durations].","OBJECTIVES: Changes in hearing thresholds were determined by standard and high-frequency audiometry in subjects exposed to occupational noise for long durations.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Hearing thresholds were measured between 250 and 16000 Hz frequencies by standard and high-frequency audiometry in 64 male workers (mean age 42 years; range 31 to 55 years) of a hydroelectric power plant and in 30 age- and sex-matched controls with no hearing problems. The workers were divided into three groups according to the noise level and into four groups according to the duration of exposure.RESULTS: The mean hearing thresholds of workers showed significant increases in all frequencies from 4000 to 16000 Hz (p&lt;0.005), the most affected frequencies being 4000, 6000, 14000, and 16000 Hz (p&lt;0.0005). Increases in hearing thresholds were significantly correlated with the noise level and duration of exposure to noise (p&lt;0.05).CONCLUSION: The results suggest that high-frequency audiometry should be used together with standard audiometry in the detection and follow-up of individuals who are at potential risks for hearing losses."
"12937188","Agreement between hearing thresholds measured in non-soundproof work environments and a soundproof booth.","AIMS: To study the agreement between audiometric test results measured in non-soundproof environments at the worksite, and in a soundproof booth.METHODS: In a cross sectional prevalence study on noise induced hearing loss, 885 transport workers whose hearing thresholds were measured by a standard audiometric test method in non-soundproof environments at the worksite were identified to have some hearing loss (&gt;25 dB), and were retested in a soundproof booth.RESULTS: At 4-8 KHz, the mean of the absolute differences in hearing threshold obtained by these two methods was 2 dB or less. When the proportions of hearing loss (&gt; or =30 dB for any frequencies at 3-8 KHz, or &gt; or =90 dB for three low frequencies at 0.5-2 KHz, or &gt; or =90 dB for three high frequencies at 3-6 KHz) were compared, considerable differences existed. A much better agreement was obtained when the criteria for hearing loss as measured in the field test under non-soundproof conditions were relaxed by 5 dB. At 4 KHz, the difference between the proportion of subjects with hearing loss as measured in the field and that as measured in the booth was the smallest. The kappa statistic was highest at 3 and 4 KHz.CONCLUSIONS: Audiometric test results conducted in non-soundproof environments in the field are comparable to those obtained in a soundproof environment among transport workers with a hearing loss of &gt;25 dB. The hearing threshold at 4 KHz appears suitable for the estimation of the prevalence of hearing loss when appropriate adjustments are made in the diagnostic criteria."
"12921130","Noise-induced hearing loss in snorers and their bed partners.","OBJECTIVE: As habitual snoring affects a large percentage of the population and is associated with various medical and social complications, we examined whether loud snoring is also associated with noise-induced hearing loss for the snorers and/or their bed partners.PATIENT SELECTION: Healthy adults between the ages of 35 and 55 years with subjective symptoms of severe snoring were screened to exclude those with a past history of noise exposure (e.g., factory workers, army personnel), use of ototoxic medications, and previously diagnosed hearing disorder.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Behavioural audiograms and otoacoustic emission testing were used to evaluate the subjects' hearing.RESULTS: Although all of the snorers did not demonstrate consistent hearing loss patterns, all four bed partners of snorers in our study demonstrated a unilateral high-frequency pattern of hearing loss consistent with noise-induced hearing loss. Furthermore, the affected ear in every case was the one that was claimed to be chronically exposed to snoring noise.CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that there may be a relationship between snoring and noise-induced hearing loss in the bed partners of chronic snorers. Further investigation of this association may enable the population at risk to identify early hearing loss in order that appropriate management of noise exposure and snoring can be recommended, including preventive measures and medical and surgical therapies."
"12883821","CAP amplitude after impulse noise exposure in guinea pigs.","In this study, 21 guinea pigs were submitted to a single high energy impulse noise (gun shot with blank projectiles). The auditory function was evaluated over a 7-day recovery period by recording the compound action potential (CAP) from the round window. The threshold shift and input/output function (CAP amplitude and delay function of the stimulus intensity) were studied at different frequencies. CAP amplitude fell after the noise trauma, especially at the lower sound level, resulting in a threshold shift. Latency was significantly increased. During recovery, whereas latency returned to its initial value, CAP amplitude gradually increased and, in half the animals, exceeded the control value for the higher levels of stimulus. This could have been because of progressive disinhibition or recruitment, and may correspond clinically to hyperacusis. These results are discussed referring to those obtained by other authors using other methods."

This study was conducted to determine the perceived effects of hearing loss in a small farming population. Ninety-three subjects, ranging in age from 18 to 75 years and actively engaged in the farming industry, were asked to complete a case history form regarding noise exposure and demographic information. Hearing sensitivity was assessed by obtaining air conduction thresholds at audiometric test frequencies 500-8000 Hz bilaterally. Subjects completed the Self Assessment of Communication (SAC) hearing handicap scale if any threshold in either ear was poorer than 25 dB HL. Study results revealed that the presence of high-frequency hearing loss and perceived hearing handicap increased with age, with the largest effects seen in those over 50 years of age. The, relationship between SAC scores and four hearing handicap formulae utilizing different pure-tone averages was also investigated. The highest correlation coefficients occurred for formulae employing higher frequencies and excluding 500 Hz in the calculation. Implications of this study are that audiologists should be aware of the potential hearing handicap associated with high-frequency hearing loss in the farming population and educational programs concerning the dangers of noise and ways to prevent NIHL should be developed for those in farming occupations."
"12807257","Monitoring and assessment of daily exposure of roadside workers to traffic noise levels in an Asian city: a case study of Bangkok streets.","Four noise monitoring sites were strategically established to evaluate average noise level and audiometric assessment at various traffic zones of Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR). During the monitoring period, noise levels were found to be 72.8-83.0 dBA during day time and 59.5-74.5 dBA during night time. The finding also indicated that traffic noise levels depend on distance from roadside, diurnal variation and character of the traffic and street configuration. Audiometric measurement of 4000 persons was carried by four major hospitals in Bangkok to study the relationship between traffic noise exposure of groups of people working in the streets and hearing loss. Four different categories of occupational people, i.e., drivers, street vendors, traffic officers and dwellers were selected and were further classified into age groups (16-25, 26-35, 36-45 and 46-55 years old) to monitor the traffic noise induced hearing loss throughout their everyday lives. The control group was deliberately chosen to screen out the effects of traffic noise. According to the audiometric investigation, it was revealed that hearing capacity of the daily noise exposure groups living in the three urban sites (Yaowarat Road, Din Daeng Road and Ratchaprarop Road) were noticeably poorer than those who were living in suburban site (Phahonyothin Road). It was noted that the mean hearing threshold level (HTL) of the 16-25 years old groups were found to have better hearing capacity than those older adults of 46-55 years old. In particular the mean HTL dropped at the frequency of 4000 Hz. Among the occupational population who were living in the urban monitoring sites, the driver groups were found to have the highest risk of traffic noise induced hearing loss."
"12768684","[Application of extended high frequency audiometry in the early diagnosis of noise--induced hearing loss].","OBJECTIVE: To assess the application of 10-20 kHz audiometry in early diagnosis of noise-induced hearing loss and to explore the relationship between hearing loss and subjects' age, the exposure time as well as the noise level.METHODS: One thousand workers with noise exposure history were examined by pure tone audiometry(0.5-20 kHz). One hundred and twenty normal subjects served as the control group.RESULTS: The noise levels at working sites ranged from 95 to 115dB(A). Compared with the control group, noise-exposed subjects showed minor changes in the thresholds from 0.5 to 6 KHz, whereas the thresholds were elevated in the high frequency range of 10-16 kHz (P &lt; 0.001). The incidence of ears without any response to the maximum output at the frequency range of 14 to 20 kHz was much higher (P &lt; 0.01) than that of the control group. In the animals exposed to noise, the thresholds of 10-18 kHz increased with the aging and with increase of working time (6-10 years), but there were no significant differences among subjects exposed to the noises at different levels(P &gt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: In noise-exposed ears, the occurrence of threshold changes in the high frequency range (10 to 20 kHz) is earlier than that in the low frequency range (0.5 to 6 kHz). Aging and working time also affect the 10-20 kHz hearing thresholds. The lack of responses to maximum output and the changes in thresholds in the high frequency range (10-20 kHz) can be used as indices for the diagnosis of early noise-induced hearing loss and for the assessment of the susceptibility of the subject to noise damage."
"12761711","Rapid recovery from acoustic trauma: chicken soup, potato knish, or drug interaction?","OBJECTIVES: To describe the phenomenology and consider possible mechanisms mediating rapid and unexpected recovery from acoustic trauma after ingestion of a food substance (potato knish).STUDY DESIGN: Single subject with repeated test measures.SETTING: Regional Veteran's Administration Medical Center, tertiary care medical center.METHODS: Pure-tone audiometry and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) performed at 6 days, 21 days, and 1 year postexposure.RESULTS: Medical treatment with corticosteriods and a diuretic alone failed to improve auditory function and related symptoms (tinnitus and aural fullness) over a 2-week period. Rapid recovery of auditory function (dramatic improvement in pure tone thresholds; reappearance of DPOAEs) and abatement of related symptoms directly followed physiologic reactions from ingesting a food substance.CONCLUSIONS: Rapid recovery from acoustic trauma was temporally correlated with urodynamic and cardiovascular reactions from ingesting food containing sulfite preservative, a substance to which the individual was allergic. Factors that may have contributed to recovery of function include massive diuresis, increased heart rate, release of biochemical mediators, mediator-induced vasodilatation, and changes in vascular or cell membrane permeability. Establishing relationships that lead to recovery of function from acoustic trauma may facilitate research and aid in the development of new treatment options for this condition."
"12755754","Objective assessment of auditory thresholds in noise-induced hearing loss using steady-state evoked potentials.","The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether steady-state evoked potential (SSEP) can be used for objective estimation of auditory thresholds in patients with noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Eleven subjects (22 ears) with a characteristic audiometric notch between 3000 and 6000 Hz participated in this study. Both pure-tone thresholds and SSEP thresholds were obtained for each ear of all subjects. The correlation of SSEP thresholds and pure-tone thresholds was assessed. The results show that SSEP thresholds predicted pure-tone thresholds with correlation coefficients (r) of 0.86, 0.92, 0.94 and 0.95 at 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz respectively. Typically, the SSEP thresholds overestimate the pure-tone thresholds by 10-20 dB, but they closely reflect the configuration of the audiogram. The strength of the relationship between SSEP and pure-tone thresholds increased with increasing frequency and increasing degree of hearing loss. In conclusion, SSEP can be used as a reliable and objective tool to assess auditory thresholds in patients with noise-induced hearing loss with high-frequency dips."
"12747520","Hearing loss among workers at an oil refinery in Taiwan.","In this study, the authors determined the characteristics of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and its association with hearing-loss-related symptoms (HLRSs) among workers at an oil refinery in Taiwan. Workers from the refinery (N = 384) who had chronic noise exposure (range = 73 to 89 dBa; mean = 81.2, standard deviation = 5.4 dBa) were enrolled in the study. Workers chronically exposed to noise levels that were less than 85 dBa experienced slight hearing loss at high frequencies [(3k + 4k + 6k)/3]. Workers with &gt; or = 1 HLRSs had increased hearing loss at low frequencies [(0.5k + 1k + 2k)/3] and high frequencies (odds ratios = 7.2 and 3.7, respectively). An increased hearing threshold shift for high frequencies (3k, 4k, and 6k Hz) was found in workers who had chronic noise exposure for more than 15 yr. These findings indicate that self-reported HLRSs provide valuable early warning signs of NIHL."
"12723484","[Utility and limitations of speech audiometry testing in the detection of occupational noise-induced hearing loss: a comparative study in two groups in the hospital setting].","OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is the evaluation of the calculation of 100% intelligibility threshold and noise resistance index as a monitoring test in populations exposed to noise in their work environment.METHOD: This is a retrospective exposed-unexposed study as the exposure to the risk factors took place before the survey. The exposed subjects were chosen in principle on sonometric criteria and the unexposed subjects among employees whom we believe were not exposed. The exploration method included history taking, clinical examination, free field audiometry and speech audiometry with background noise.RESULTS: The exposed population has a 100% intelligibility threshold on average equal to 29.69 dB, significantly higher than in the unexposed population where it is calculated at 25.30 dB (p = 0.07). The noise resistance index varies with age (p = 0.04).CONCLUSION: Our study shows the existence of a significant hearing difference between two populations with different noise exposure. It demonstrates a relationship between a hearing loss risk factor such as noise and the occurrence of the &quot;professional hearing loss&quot; disorder. The calculation of the 100% intelligibility index and the noise resistance index advantageously complements tonal audiometry. These procedures provide a better approach to the social impact of hearing loss but were not useful in the detection of hearing loss."
"12701733","Effect of ipsilateral and contralateral low-frequency narrow-band noise on temporary threshold shift in humans.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of ipsilateral and contralateral low-frequency (250 Hz) narrow-band noise (NBN) on the temporary threshold shift (TTS) induced by a 2 kHz tone in young normally hearing subjects with a functioning auditory efferent system.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixteen young volunteers served as subjects. All the subjects were young (20-30 years), disease-free and had a medical history negative for otological disease, noise exposure and use of ototoxic drugs. They had normal hearing [thresholds of 125-8,000 Hz below 20 dB hearing level (HL)], transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions and contralateral suppression. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of three different groups. Subjects in Group A (n = 5) were exposed to a 90 dB HL 2 kHz pure tone for 10 min. Subjects in Group B (n = 6) were exposed to a 90 dB HL 2 kHz pure tone and an ipsilateral 45 dB HL 250 Hz NBN for 10 min. Subjects in Group C (n = 5) were exposed to a 90 dB HL 2 kHz pure tone and a contralateral 45 dB HL 250 Hz NBN for 10 min. The right ear served as the test ear. The TTS 2 min after the end of the exposure (TTS2) was measured in all subjects at 2, 3 and 4 kHz.RESULTS: TTS, in Group A was significantly higher at 3 kHz (p = 0.011) and at 4 kHz (p = 0.003) than TTS2 in Group B. At 4 kHz, TTS2 in Group C was significantly higher (p = 0.013) than TTS2 in Group B. Although TTS2 in Group C was lower than TTS2 in Group A, this difference was not significant. The presence of an ipsilateral low-frequency NBN significantly reduced TTS2 induced by a 90 dB HL 2 kHz tone. A contralateral low-frequency NBN reduced TTS2 in this group of subjects; however, the reduction was not significant.CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that an ipsilateral low-intensity, low-frequency (250 Hz) NBN can give protection from a TTS induced by a 2 kHz tone. Contralateral low-frequency NBN did not induce any protective effect."
"12701731","Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions study of the noise-induced toughening effect in rats.","OBJECTIVE: To compare the toughening effects in rats induced by pure tones and a broadband noise (BBN).MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sprague-Dawley female albino rats (n = 148; 8-10 weeks old) were used. Three experimental groups were established as follows. Toughening only: 38 rats, divided into 3 subgroups, were exposed to different conditioning sounds (2 and 4 kHz and a BBN of 0.25-6 kHz, respectively) at 75-85 dB sound pressure limit (SPL) for 8 h/day for 10 days. Acoustic trauma only: 54 rats, divided into 3 subgroups, were exposed to different conditioning sounds as above for 24 h at 100-110 dB SPL. Toughening plus acoustic trauma: 56 rats, divided into 3 subgroups, were exposed to different conditioning sounds as above, followed 8 h later by traumatic exposure to the conditioning sound at 110 dB SPL for 24 h. 2f1-f2 distortion-product (DP) otoacoustic emission measurements were obtained from the right ear of each animal pre-exposure, immediately post-exposure and after 8 h of the traumatic or conditioning exposure.RESULTS: In our control DPgram response, the maximum amplitude occurred at the highest frequencies (2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 kHz). No statistical differences between the control DPgram and the DP toughening (2 and 4 kHz and BBN)responses were found. Only 2 and 4 kHz frequencies induced a protective effect against traumatic sound exposures to the same frequencies, and this finding was statistically significant.CONCLUSION: The toughening phenomenon induced using 2 and 4 kHz pure tones and BBN in rats does not modify the DPgram response. Nevertheless, only 2 and 4 kHz frequencies induce a protective effect against traumatic sound exposures to the same frequencies."

"12693766","Prevalence of hearing disorders in Singapore military conscripts: a role for routine audiometry screening?","AIM: To determine the prevalence of hearing disorders in Singapore military conscripts and describe the profile of hearing loss and associated risk factors.METHODS: Population-based descriptive analysis of randomised cohort of 818 Singapore military conscripts presenting for medical examination, using self-administered questionnaire and pure tone audiometry performed for both ears. Main outcome measures are prevalence rate of hearing loss and relative risk of hearing loss by demographic factors and surrogates for noise exposure.RESULTS: Prevalence of hearing loss was 36.7 per 1,000 (95% CI 24.8, 51.9). Of 30 subjects with hearing loss, 19 (63.3%) had loss at high frequency, 7 (23.3%) at low frequency, and 4 (13.4%) in both ranges. Hearing loss was unilateral in 17 (56.7%) subjects and bilateral in 13 (43.3%). Relative risk of hearing loss did not differ by age group, education level, race or frequency of personal stereo use. Relative risk of hearing loss is higher in subjects with frequent discotheque visits compared to those who never do so (RR = 2.72, 95%CI 1.09, 6.76).CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of hearing loss in Singapore military conscripts points to the need for routine audiometry screening prior to enlistment. This will be useful in assigning military vocations, in clinical case management, and for assessing cases of noise-induced hearing loss attributable to military service."
"12689368","Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions in acute acoustic trauma.","Acute acoustic traumas are caused by exposure to extremely high noise levels ranging from milliseconds to several hours' duration. In pure tone audiometry they range from the C5 dip to basomediocochlear sensorineural hearing loss. Their pathogenesis is assumed to consist of micromechanical-traumatic and biochemical-metabolic damage to the outer hair cells. In order to establish the changes to the DPOAE (distortion products of otoacoustic emissions), 17 patients were examined after sustaining acute acoustic trauma. The causes included firework explosions, anti-tank rocket launchers, vehicle tyre bursting, rock concerts, hand-gun shots, sub-machine gun fire, hand grenade explosion, exploding car battery. The pure tone audiogram, tympanogram, tinnitus maskability and DPOAE (both DP-gram and growth rate in various frequencies) were determined in all patients. If the event had occurred some time ago, measurements were taken only once; in acute cases measurements were repeated at different times. In nine patients with persistent hearing impairment, clear DPs were found in the unaffected frequencies but were completely absent in the affected frequency range. Four of these patients were unilaterally and two patients were bilaterally affected; three patients had a different (not noise-induced) hearing loss on the opposite side. In eight patients with regressive hearing loss, DPs were by contrast detectable throughout the entire frequency range, their amplitudes only rising slightly as hearing recovered. Of these eight patients, three were unilaterally and five bilaterally affected. DPOAE seem to indicate the likelihood of recovery of hearing threshold after an acute acoustic trauma. In cases with DPs completely absent in the affected frequency range, the prognosis seems to be much worse than in cases with present DPs in the frequency range of hearing."
"12631437","The role of hearing protectors in leisure noise.","Ear muffs and ear plugs are widely used in the workplace to provide hearing protection for employees exposed to high levels of noise. Through an examination of the use of ear protectors in the workplace this paper explores the extent to which these devices can play a similar role in protecting members of the public from hearing damage arising from exposure to high levels of noise from leisure activities. It is concluded that the major limitation to the effective use of ear protectors for leisure use is likely to be the lack of easily accessible information, advice and guidance on the nature of the hearing protection risk from noisy leisure activities, and on the availability, selection and use of protectors, and of the need for regular hearing checks."

Pure tone averages (PTA) and hearing disability were calculated using the Irish and American Medical Association systems. A PTA of &gt;10 dB worse than the CERA average was considered evidence of exaggerated thresholds.RESULTS: The mean PTA was 33 dB. Seventy-two percent had a hearing disability of an average of 26% when assessed by the Irish system. Fifty-four percent had a hearing disability of an average of 30% when assessed by the American Medical Association system. Twenty-six percent of subjects had exaggerated thresholds based on CERA. A binaural hearing threshold of &gt;25 dB at 500 Hz had a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 59% for the detection of exaggerated thresholds.CONCLUSION: Exaggerated hearing thresholds are common. A hearing threshold of &gt;25 dB at 500 Hz should be considered an indication for CERA testing."
"12597181","Evaluation of the risk of noise-induced hearing loss among unscreened male industrial workers.","Variability in background risk and distribution of various risk factors for hearing loss may explain some of the diversity in excess risk of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). This paper examines the impact of various risk factors on excess risk estimates of NIHL using data from the 1968-1972 NIOSH Occupational Noise and Hearing Survey (ONHS). Previous analyses of a subset of these data focused on 1172 highly &quot;screened&quot; workers. In the current analysis, an additional 894 white males (609 noise-exposed and 285 controls), who were excluded for various reasons (i.e., nonoccupational noise exposure, otologic or medical conditions affecting hearing, prior occupational noise exposure) have been added 2066) to assess excess risk of noise-induced material impairment in an unscreened population. Data are analyzed by age, duration of exposure, and sound level (8-h TWA) for four different definitions of noise-induced hearing impairment, defined as the binaural pure-tone average (PTA) hearing threshold level greater than 25 dB for the following frequencies: (a) 1-4 kHz (PTA1234), (b) 1-3 kHz (PTA123), (c) 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz (PTA512), and (d) 3, 4, and 6 kHz (PTA346). Results indicate that populations with higher background risks of hearing loss may show lower excess risks attributable to noise relative to highly screened populations. Estimates of lifetime excess risk of hearing impairment were found to be significantly different between screened and unscreened population for noise levels greater than 90 dBA. Predicted age-related risk of material hearing impairment in the ONHS unscreened population was similar to that predicted from Annex B and C of ANSI S3.44 for ages less than 60 years. Results underscore the importance of understanding differential risk patterns for hearing loss and the use of appropriate reference (control) populations when evaluating risk of noise-induced hearing impairment among contemporary industrial populations."
"12592917","Effects of occupational ultrasonic noise exposure on hearing of dental hygienists: a pilot study.","PURPOSE: The purpose of this case-control study was to determine whether long-term ultrasonic noise exposure via the dental office environment is related to dental hygienists' hearing status.METHODS: Registered dental hygienists (N = 698) who live in the Hampton Roads areas of Virginia were mailed a Dental Hygiene Work History Questionnaire to determine who would meet the inclusion criteria and would be willing to participate in the study. Consenting subjects were categorized into one of two groups, according to ultrasonic scaler usage rate, and matched on age. Persons with known hearing loss due to infection, disease, or congenital defect were excluded from the study. The final sample consisted of 20 dental hygienists with a high ultrasonic usage rate and a matched group of 20 dental hygienists who had a low ultrasonic usage rate. Once the groups were formed, a certified audiologist tested subjects' hearing in each ear via the pure-tone audiometer. Audiometric data were analyzed using the analysis of variance for repeated measures procedure to determine if degree of ultrasonic scaler noise exposure in the dental office environment was significantly related to hearing status in these dental hygienists.RESULTS: Results revealed that the right and left ears were not statistically different in the hearing threshold levels, regardless of group status. However, there was a significant difference in the high ultrasonic usage group and the low ultrasonic usage group at the 3000 Hz. No differences were found at the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz.CONCLUSIONS: Based on these outcomes, the ultrasonic scaler is not considered to have a negative effect on the hearing of dental hygienists at 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz, but may be related to hearing loss at 3000 Hz. Ultrasonic noise may in fact be affecting dental hygienists' hearing at 3000 Hz, but loss of hearing observed at the higher frequencies may be attributed to other unidentified factors present in both groups."

The study material comprised 13 types of weapons used by this group of soldiers. During the target practice, the following parameters were measured separately for the right ear and the left ear: equivalent sound pressure level A (LA eq, Te); maximum sound pressure level A (LA F max) and peak sound pressure level C (LC peak). The measurements covered several single shots or a shot series. In addition, a spectroanalysis in 1/3-octave band frequency of 40-50,000 Hz, was conducted. There were following values of measurements in the direct vicinity of the ears: LA eq, Te fell within the range of 106.2-119.5 dB (mean, 112.2 dB) for the right ear and 104.2 dB-118.4 dB (mean, 113.2 dB) for the left ear; LA F max within the range of 124.5-132.3 dB (mean, 128.3 dB) for the right ear and 116.3-135.1 dB (mean, 128.1 dB) for the left ear; LC pcak within the range of 151.8-156.5 dB (mean, 154.8 dB/155 dB) for the right ear and 151.9-156.2 dB (mean, 155.4 dB) for the left ear. In the noise spectrum, components of audible frequencies predominated, 160-300 Hz (mainly for high caliber weapon); 1600-6300 Hz for the right ear and 2500-4000 Hz for the left peak (small caliber weapons); 6300-16,000 and ultrasonic 25,000-50,000 Hz.

"12564513","Temporary threshold shift in military pilots measured using conventional and extended high-frequency audiometry after one flight.","Noise of such a high level that it can result in hearing deterioration is an inherent characteristic of military flying. Susceptibility to hearing impairment was studied using 51 Finnish Air Force military personnel as subjects. The test persons flew missions on a British Aerospace Hawk 51 advanced jet trainer, Boeing F-18 Hornet, Mikoyan &amp; Gurevich MiG-21bis and Saab 35 Draken interceptors, and a Valmet Redigo turboprop liaison aircraft. The duration of noise exposure was one flight mission, which varied from 30 to 60 min. Noise doses and levels were measured using a miniature microphone at the inlet of the ear canal, while a second microphone was located at the level of the subject's shoulder. Hearing thresholds were measured before each flight using conventional (0.125-8 kHz) and extended high-frequency (EHF) (8.20 kHz) audiometry. The measurements were repeated as soon as possible after the flight. The study showed that the pre-flight threshold levels of the subjects were good. Both conventional and EHF audiometry revealed statistically significant temporary threshold shifts (TTS) at several frequencies and with all aircraft types involved. The changes were, however, minor. The risk of noise-induced hearing impairment at the studied exposure levels is, in all probability, rather small. The role of extended high-frequency audiometry would be in research, and it might be performed for flying personnel upon entering service and every fifth year thereafter."
"12553175","Ototoxic effects of occupational exposure to styrene and co-exposure to styrene and noise.","Ototoxicity of styrene and the synergistic action of styrene and noise have been shown in rats. The respective data in humans are scarce and equivocal. This study evaluated the effects of occupational exposure to styrene and combined exposures to styrene and noise on hearing. The study group, comprised of 290-yacht yard and plastic factory workers, was exposed to a mixture of organic solvents, having styrene as its main compound. The reference group, totaling 223 subjects, included (1) white-collar workers, exposed neither to solvents nor noise and (2) metal factory workers, exposed exclusively to noise. All subjects were assessed by means of a detailed questionnaire and underwent otorhinolaryngological and audiometric examinations. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed almost a 4-fold (or 3.9; 95% CI = 2.4-6.2) increase in the odds of developing hearing loss related to styrene exposure. The factors adjusted for were: age, gender, current occupational exposure to noise, and exposure to noise in the past. In cases of the combined exposures to styrene and noise, the odds ratios were two to three times higher than the respective values for styrene-only and noise-only exposed subjects. The mean hearing thresholds--adjusted for age, gender, and exposure to noise--were significantly higher in the solvent-exposed group than in the unexposed reference group at all frequencies tested. A positive linear relationship existed between an averaged working life exposure to styrene concentration and a hearing threshold at the frequencies of 6 and 8 kHz. This study provides the epidemiological evidence that occupational exposure to styrene is related to an increased risk of hearing loss. Combined exposures to noise and styrene seem to be more ototoxic than exposure to noise alone."

There was significant difference of the incidence of presbycusis between urban and rural. The audiometric thresholds chart manifested that the threshold elevated with age increasing especially in high-frequency.CONCLUSION: The etiology of hearing loss of elders was mainly due to presbycusis. The higher incidence of psychotic disorder in urban probably caused a correspondingly higher incidence of presbycusis. So the prevention and cure of some age-induced diseased (e.g. hypertension, arteriosclerosis and diabetes) may be helpful to release and improve presbycusis."

One hundred and seventeen workers were tested in routine pure-tone tested method. The SPVN and ABR were tested within fifty-one workers of all.RESULT: The working noise of Yansan Petrochemical Co. belongs to the broad band and steady noise. The intensity of the working noise were during 85.7-104.0 dB(A) and the main frequency were during 1-8 kHz. About 59 percent workers who exposed to the working noise had hearing loss. The most hearing-loss were in the high frequency. The hearing-loss of speech frequency were slight. Workers who have more six years standing have obviously increased hearing-loss than the workers who have less five years standing. There were significant differences the ABR thresholds and wave-interval between the tested and controlled groups. The SPVN and CP were abnormal in more than 17.4 percent workers with hearing loss.CONCLUSION: The working noise of Yansan Petrochemical Co. belongs to the broad band and steady noise. Working noise can lead to workers' hearing loss of certain degrees who exposed in the noise for a long time. Obvious correlation was not defined between the hearing-loss and the abnormal vestibular response group."

For each subject, age, smoking status (current, past or non-smokers) and number of cigarettes per day were noted and a hearing test was performed. The test was performed in a sealed, soundproof room by an experienced audiologist and included pure tone audiometry of 250-8,000 Hz. The audiograms were analyzed and subjects were accordingly divided into two groups: those with HL and at least one of the following impairments in at least one ear: sensorineural, conductive or mixed; and those with no hearing loss (control). Audiograms showing HL typical to noise exposure were excluded.RESULTS: The prevalence of any type of HL among subjects &lt; 35 years was 4.5%, compared to 10.5% among those &gt; 35 years (P &lt; 0.0001). A significantly higher incidence of any type of HL was found in current (11.8%) and past smokers (11.7%) than in non-smokers (8.1%) (P &lt; 0.0001). The risk increment of the smoking status for developing HL among subjects under age 35 was 43%, and 17% among those above 35 years. Both mild, flat, sensorineural impairment and conductive impairment were found to be associated particularly with smoking (odds ratio 2.2 and 1.9, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of HL unrelated to noise exposure is higher in smokers than in non-smokers, and in young adults the effect is greater."

The aim of the study was to assess the acoustic environment of persons exposed to jet engine noise and its effect on hearing.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Noise measurements were performed on three jet engines. During the target practice, the following parameters were measured: equivalent noise, pressure level A, maximum sound pressure level A, and peak sound pressure level C. The spectro-analysis covering the range from 0.1 to 20 kHz was conducted. Hearing was assessed in 50 noise-exposed men, aged 24-51 years (mean age, 35.5 years), using PTA, tympanometry and DPOAE. The control group consisted of 40 non-exposed persons with good hearing condition.RESULTS: Maximum levels of acoustic pressure exceeded Polish standards. Comparison between two groups showed that PTA was higher in the exposed persons by 6.3-6.8 dB on average and DPOAE was reduced in the group exposed to jet engine noise more than it could have been expected.CONCLUSIONS: Even during a single test, aircraft technical personnel was exposed to (audible) noise that significantly exceeded admissible values. The reduction in DPOAE values in persons exposed to noise of jet engines was incommensurably higher than changes in PTA."

The following tests were used with all individuals: Speech Recognition Test, dichotic test Staggered Spondaic Word (SSW) and Speech in Noise Test (signal/noise ratio of +5 and -5 dB with ipsilateral white noise).RESULTS: The Speech Recognition Test and the SSW are not or little useful to discriminate between individuals with NIHL and those with normal hearing.CONCLUSION: The Speech in Noise Test can be sensitive in the identification of the hearing alterations presented by individuals with NIHL."
"15609579","[Audiometric evaluation in extended high frequencies of individuals exposed to occupational noise].","BACKGROUND: Audiometric evaluation in extended high frequencies.AIM: To evaluate the hearing of adults exposed to occupational noise in conventional and ultra-high frequencies.METHOD: Evaluation of 30 adults exposed to noise and 30 adults who are not exposed (control group). Audiometer SD-50/Siemens, phones HDA200 and warble tone.RESULTS: With the increase in frequency, age and time of noise exposure there was a higher decrease in the hearing thresholds for the group of individuals exposed to noise. A higher incidence of hearing loss at 6 kHz and 14 kHz was observed.CONCLUSION: The present research demonstrated that the audiometric evaluation in extended high frequencies contributes to the early diagnosis of cortipathies, since these thresholds are affected before the conventional frequencies."
"15576875","Hearing Surveillance Chart--a tool for tracking serial audiometry results and predicting future hearing impairment.","High frequency hearing loss is related to noise-induced deafness. We decided to develop a method of recording serial audiogram results that would provide an accessible overview of trends for an individual. Health &amp; Safety Executive (HSE) warning and referral levels for high frequency hearing losses were plotted against age. A third line was added to indicate a level of 'significant' handicap. This graph is inserted in each individual's hearing surveillance record. High frequency hearing loss results are plotted for each ear over time. Someone with known hearing loss but minimal deterioration will exceed the HSE warning level at every review, whereas someone with perfect hearing suffering a significant deterioration may not exceed the warning level initially. The latter should be of more concern to their current employer."
"15551949","[Noise-related occupational risk aboard fishing vessels: considerations on prevention and the protection of exposed workers].","Recent legislation regarding the safety of workers aboard fishing vessels requires the appointment by ship owners of a Reference Physician in charge of health surveillance, preventive inspections and related tasks. As maritime workers, especially fishermen, have always been excluded from legal protection of occupational health, there are no exhaustive data on the incidence of their occupational disease. Several epidemiological studies of fishermen have evidenced a high prevalence and incidence of occupational conditions, among which noise-related hypoacousia. We report data of a phonometric survey conducted aboard six fishing vessels carrying a crew of less than six fishing in the mid-Adriatic. Measurements were performed during fishing and navigation aboard five vessels fitted with a fixed-pitch propeller and during fishing only aboard one vessel fitted with an controllable pitch propeller. Measurements were conducted: 1) in the engine rooms; 2) in the work area on deck; 3) at the winch; 4) in the wheelhouse; 5) in the mess-room and kitchen; 6) in the sleeping quarters. Results show that the equivalent sound pressure level in the engine rooms consistently exceeded 90 dBA on all vessels. The speed of the vessels fitted with the fixed-pitch propeller is 3-4 knots in the fishing phase and around 10 knots during navigation to and from the fishing grounds; noise emission is lower with the former regimen because of the smaller number of engine revolutions per minute. Our survey demonstrated considerably different noise levels in the various areas of vessels. One key element in workers' exposure, the tasks assigned and the environmental working conditions is of course the type of fishing in which the vessel is engaged. Further phonometric studies are required to assess the daily level of exposure per crew member, which represents the reference for the noise-related risk of each subject. Knowledge of the sound pressure levels in the work environment and the length of daily exposure of each crew member will allow to assess the level of occupational exposure and consequently enact the proper prevention and protection measures by the Reference Physician."
"15497506","Frequency-specific association of antibodies against heat shock proteins 60 and 70 with noise-induced hearing loss in Chinese workers.","Noise exposure may result in production of auto-antibodies against heat shock proteins (Hsps), which might be of significance in the pathogenesis or prognosis (or both) of auto-immune ear diseases. However, it is not known whether these antibodies are associated with noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in workers exposed to noise in occupational settings. Using immunoblotting with human recombinant Hsps, audiological assessment, and multivariate logistic regression models, we investigated the presence of antibodies against Hsp60 and Hsp70 and hearing levels, and analyzed their associations with NIHL in 399 workers exposed to noise between 75 and 115 dB. Our findings showed that the prevalence of positive anti-Hsp70 was significantly higher in the workers with slight and moderate high-frequency hearing loss than in normal workers (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the prevalence of positive anti-Hsp60 in workers with moderate low-frequency NIHL was significantly higher than in the normal (P &lt; 0.01). The levels of anti-Hsp70 and anti-Hsp60 seemed correlated, and the level of anti-Hsp70 better predicted the level of anti-Hsp60. An elevated plasma level of anti-Hsp70 was associated with a nonsignificantly increased risk of high-frequency NIHL (adjusted OR = 1.45; 95% CI = 0.89-2.36) and an elevated plasma level of anti-Hsp60 was associated with a nonsignificantly increased risk of the low-frequency NIHL (adjusted OR = 2.25; 95% CI = 0.85-5.96). These results suggest that the production of anti-Hsp60 and anti-Hsp70 may play a role in the pathogenesis of NIHL, and that anti-Hsps may be a risk factor. The precise mechanisms for the elevation of antibodies against Hsps caused by noise exposure and their possible role in the development of NIHL warrant further investigations."
"15477283","Predictors of hearing threshold levels and distortion product otoacoustic emissions among noise exposed young adults.","AIM: To examine the relations between noise exposure and other risk factors with hearing function as measured by audiometric thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emissions.METHODS: A total of 456 subjects were studied (393 apprentices in construction trades and 63 graduate students). Hearing and peripheral auditory function were quantified using standard, automated threshold audiometry, tympanometry, and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). The analysis addressed relations of noise exposure history and other risk factors with hearing threshold levels (HTLs) and DPOAEs at the baseline test for the cohort.RESULTS: The cohort had a mean age of 27 (7) years. The construction apprentices reported more noise exposure than students in both their occupational and non-occupational exposure histories. A strong effect of age and years of work in construction was observed at 4, 6, and 8 kHz for both HTLs and DPOAEs. Each year of construction work reported prior to baseline was associated with a 0.7 dB increase in HTL or 0.2 dB decrease DPOAE amplitude. Overall, there was a very similar pattern of effects between the HTLs and DPOAEs.CONCLUSIONS: This analysis shows a relatively good correspondence between the associations of noise exposures and other risk factors with DPOAEs and the associations observed with pure-tone audiometric thresholds in a young adult working population. The results provide further evidence that DPOAEs can be used to assess damage to hearing from a variety of exposures including noise. Clarifying advantages of DPOAEs or HTLs in terms of sensitivity to early manifestations of noise insults, or their utility in predicting future loss in hearing will require longitudinal follow up."

"15460627","Hearing and performance during a 70-h exposure to noise simulating the space station environment.","INTRODUCTION: Elevated hearing thresholds have been documented in some astronauts after long-term spaceflights although noise levels were lower than those normally associated with noise-induced hearing loss in ground-based operations. The present study was conducted to determine whether prolonged exposure (70 h) to levels (72 dBA) recorded on the International Space Station (ISS) service module would impact diverse measures of auditory function, as well as cognition and memory, motivation, and cardiovascular function.METHOD: Five mixed gender subgroups of five normal-hearing subjects, aged 20-50 yr, were sequestered for 70 h in an environment that modeled conditions on the ISS. They were assigned to one of three background conditions: quiet (n = 5), continuous noise from the ISS service module (n = 10), or continuous noise during the day only (n = 10). Subjects were tested repeatedly within and across days as individuals or pair mates.RESULTS: There were no negative effects of the noise on any of the outcome measures. Introduction of a delay or noise in a communication channel used in the assessment of speech communicability significantly affected the time taken for joint problem solving by partners.DISCUSSION: The results of this study were not consistent with the observation of hearing loss measured after spaceflights. Nor were changes evident in cognition, motivation, or cardiovascular function. Factors which might account for the discrepancy are discussed."
"15457813","A longitudinal study of changes in evoked otoacoustic emissions and pure-tone thresholds as measured in a hearing conservation program.","Non-linear transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) at 74dB pSPL, distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) at 65/45dB SPL and pure-tone audiometry were used to detect noise-induced, inner car changes in a longitudinal study. Repeated-measures ANOVAs were made on the Noise (n=69) and Quiet (n=42) groups. The Noise group's hearing thresholds increased by 1.2 dB and DPOAE amplitude decreased by -0.9 dB. For both groups, TEOAE amplitude decreased by approximately -0.6 dB. Eight of 12 ears with permanent threshold shift (PTS) and 10 of 13 ears with temporary threshold shift (TTS) showed TEOAE decrements or low baseline TEOAE amplitudes. Fewer TTS and PTS ears also showed DPOAE decrements, and there was never a DPOAE decrement without a corresponding TEOAE decrement or low TEOAE baseline. Some TTS ears showed permanent emission decrements. Although otoacoustic emissions show promise in detecting noise-induced inner ear changes, it is premature to use them in hearing conservation programs."

According to length of noise exposure time, test group was disparted to test 1,2,3 groups. Stimulated tone of TEOAE is non-linearity click of 80 dB SPL.RESULT: In test group and test 1,2,3 group against control, pure tone threshold in all frequency increased significantly, and correlation, strength and SNR of TEOAE in overall and every frequency declined significantly (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01). To observe test 1,2,3 group, It was found that pure tone threshold in all frequency increased and correlation, strength and SNR of TEOAE in overall and every frequency declined, when length of noise exposure time is increased. In 2.50-3.50 and 3.50-4.50 kHz, measuring values of TEOAE declined most significantly.CONCLUSION: Occupational noise-induced hearing loss can been measured and diagnosed significantly with TEOAE. The best observed contents is correlation, strength and SNR of TEOAE in overall and every part frequency. The best sensitivity observed frequency parts of TEOAE is 2.50-3.50 and 3.50-4.50 kHz."

This is disappointing, because neither noise exposure nor the consequent risk of noise-induced hearing loss seems to have changed much in the past 20 years. Noise is, however, a generic hazard, and this article reviews current best practice in prevention."

Fish were fed one of the three experimental diets containing either: (1) low vitamin E content (14.5 mg/kg diet as alpha-tocopheryl acetate), (2) an adequate amount of vitamin E (50 mg/kg), or (3) high vitamin E content (450 mg/kg). After 4 weeks on the diet, fish were exposed to either 2 or 24 h of intense white noise (142 dB re: 1 microPa, bandwidth 0.3-4.0 kHz). Auditory thresholds were measured, using the auditory brainstem response (ABR) technique, within 0.5 days following noise exposure or within a recovery period of 1.5 days. Additionally, liver samples were analyzed for vitamin E content. Increased vitamin E supplementation was dose-dependently associated with a reduction in statistically significant threshold shifts after noise exposure and an enhancement of recovery (i.e., more complete recovery over a shorter period) for fish exposed to either 2 or 24 h of noise. The results obtained suggest that dietary vitamin E affords protection against noise exposure in a cyprinid fish."
"15200522","Hearing loss and perceptions of noise in the workplace among rural Australians.","OBJECTIVE: To compare measured hearing levels of individuals regularly exposed to noise in their workplace to self-reported and family-reported hearing loss. To compare the attitudes and preventative actions adopted by individuals who are more aware of the potential for hearing loss to less aware individuals.DESIGN: The project examined the perceptions of rural workers concerning noise, noise exposure and hearing. The subjects completed a 'Noise at Work' questionnaire and some demographic data at the time of audiometric testing.SETTING: The subjects were recruited when attending their rural health clinic for audiometric testing.PARTICIPANTS: Participants comprised 113 men and 23 women (20-65 years, mean = 39.6, SD = 11.4) working across a range of activities at different levels in their workplaces. The range in current employment was from 0.5 to 45 years (mean = 13.8, SD = 10.7).RESULTS: Hearing tests were compared with perceptions of noise annoyance, hearing damage risk and preventative action. Self- and family-reported hearing loss and conversational difficulties in noise correlated well with measured audiograms. Perceptions of workplace noise tended to be more positive if people felt they had hearing problems. There was no difference in preventative action between those who did and did not feel they had hearing problems. Both groups rated barriers to action and lack of self-efficacy in a similar negative way.CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for specific training to ensure that rural workers have skills to take more positive action in reducing noise exposure at work."

The causes leading to AAT, causative weapons and mode and level of hearing protection were analysed to find out why so many AATs still occur in the FDF. The material consisted of 119 patients of the total 163 AAT patients treated at the Central Military Hospital during the year 2000. In 87.5% of cases, the AATs occurred in unprotected ears. The most common causative weapon was the assault rifle. Most of the AATs occurred during combat training in the field. Immediately after the AAT. 46.7% of conscripts had hearing impairment and 94.2% tinnitus. Hearing loss, tinnitus or both were experienced by 45% of conscripts at the last follow-up. Careful planning of training exercises could probably prevent some but not all AATs."
"15198380","The effects of 'supra-physiological' vitamin B12 administration on temporary threshold shift.","The aim of this study was to evaluate, in 20 young volunteer subjects, the effects of supra-physiological vitamin B12 administration on noise-induced temporary threshold shift (TTS). All subjects had hearing thresholds within 15 dBHL and type A tympanograms. The subjects were randomly assigned to two different groups. Experimental group subjects received cyanocobalamin, 1 mg daily for 7 days, and 5 mg on the eighth day. Control group subjects received a placebo injection daily for 8 days. The vitamin B12 concentration, hearing thresholds and TTS2 (10 min of exposure, narrowband noise centred at 3 kHz, bandwidth of 775 Hz, 112 dBSPL) were measured before and 8 days after treatment. At the end of treatment, the serum vitamin B12 concentration was significantly increased in the experimental group. After 8 days of treatment, the control group showed the same hearing thresholds and TTS2 degrees. Statistical analysis showed that TTS2 decreased significantly at 3 and 4kHz when cobalamin was used to increase the serum concentration of vitamin B12 to &gt; 2350 pg/ml. In addition, a protective effect at 3 kHz in the experimental group was evident when compared with the placebo group. These results suggest that elevated plasma cyanocobalamin levels may reduce the risk of hearing dysfunction resulting from noise exposure in healthy, young subjects."
"15143698","[Noise-induced hearing loss--factors affecting worker's decision to submit a disability claim].","Noise-induced hearing loss is recognized worldwide as a prevalent work-related morbidity and is the most common compensated occupational disease in Israel. Despite extended legislation, hearing conservation programs, surveillance and biological monitoring (by audiometry) of work sites and workers, the burden of this injury remains high. As a rule, afflicted workers refrain from filing compensation claims and do so only at later stages when both subjective and objective evidence of advanced hearing loss is present. We have evaluated the determinants that seem to influence the decision of an individual worker to file a claim. We found that the major determinants are subjective perception of the level of hearing disability and clinical symptoms such as: tinnitus (OR = 3.3 with CI 95% = 2.1 5.2), verbal communication disturbances (OR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.9-3.8), complaints of dizziness (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.4-2.5), severity of hearing impairment (by audiometry with OR = 1.04, 955 CI = 1.02-1.06) and musculoskeletal complaints (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.2-2.2). These findings attest to the relatively late stage in the development of noise-induced hearing loss at which workers file a claim for compensation and rehabilitation. In order to alleviate the burden of this injury in the future and encourage workers to approach the National Insurance Institute at an earlier stage, we suggest several ways of intervention and improving the awareness of all parties concerned."

"15137634","Health implication among occupational exposed workers in a chromium alloy factory, Thailand.","This study was conducted to assess the occupational exposure and its health impact on the chromium alloy workers. Environmental and biological monitoring, noise and audiometry measurements were done to evaluate the exposure levels in the factory. A total of 112 non-smoking workers were monitored from July 2001 to August 2002. The results showed that most of the chromium and lead exposures in the factory were below the ACGIH-TWA of 50 microg/m3 for chromium(VI) and OSHA-PEL of 50 microg/m3 for lead. The highest chromium (7.25 +/- 0.16 microg/m3) and lead (14.50 +/- 0.29 microg/m3) concentrations were measured in the vibro room. The results indicated that elevated concentrations of chromium and lead were found in both blood and urine samples especially in those areas which were characterized by poor ventilation. The metal contents in blood and urine samples were significantly correlated with airborne metal concentrations in the factory. The result demonstrated that blood and urinary levels among workers were associated with increasing age and duration of exposure. The background noise level of the factory ranged from 67.6 to 89.2 dBA and was frequently higher than the threshold limit value for noise (90 dBA). According to the audiometric test, the exposed workers showed signs of noise-induced hearing loss. Noise at work continued to be an important factor to hearing loss among exposed workers. In our statistical analysis, a significant hearing loss was established on age effect and year of exposure among the workforce."
"15115600","Pathophysiological changes of the central auditory pathway after blunt trauma of the head.","It is the aim of the present paper to correlate clinical symptoms of auditory dysfunction (tinnitus, hyperacusis, hearing loss) one year on average after a blunt trauma of the head with objective audiological test results (otoacoustic emission and auditory brainstem response testing, impedance audiometry) and to compare these findings to controls without history of head trauma. Thirty-one patients (24-56 years) were included. They were largely female (n = 26). The clinical and otolaryngological examination (including otoscopy) of all patients revealed no pathological abnormalities. Pure-tone audiograms were normal with one exception (pre-existing noise-induced hearing loss) as well as tympanograms. The main auditory symptoms were tinnitus (n = 9), hyperacusis (n = 2) and a reported transient hearing loss immediately after the trauma (n = 16) (which had improved at the time of examination). The results of testing the central auditory pathway showed that the transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions (otoemissions) revealed statistically significant differences between amplitude differences of all patients as well as patients with tinnitus and controls in the linear, but not in the non-linear stimulation mode. A complete loss of stapedial reflex responses was found in 12 of the patients and a partial (irregular) loss (in at least more than two frequencies) in four additional patients. Auditory brainstem responses (ABR) were normal in all patients, but 76% had lowered loudness discomfort levels (LDL). Blunt trauma of the head can lead to auditory dyfunction, probably as a result of diffuse axonal injury of the central auditory pathway. An initial sensorineural hearing loss after the trauma (as a result of the inner ear fluid concussion) was transiently reported only. Auditory symptoms play a minor role in the so-called &quot;postconcussive syndrome,&quot; but should be considered and evaluated fully."

"15046413","Changes in clinical and instrumental vestibular parameters following acute exposition to auditory stress.","Besides Tullio's phenomenon, resulting from anatomic changes in the labyrinth, a hypersensitivity to acoustic stimuli of the saccular structures appears to be the underlying cause of the vestibular responses detected in some patients. In order to evaluate the incidence of vestibular symptoms triggered by acute exposure to auditory stress (disco music), 40 subjects aged between 18 and 26 years, with no audiological and vestibular disorders, were submitted to otoneurologic tests. Subjects were exposed to disco music [intensity 128 dB (C)], for 3 hours. Tests have been carried out before and immediately after exposure. Canalar and macular functions have been evaluated using vestibular investigation techniques and vestibular evoked myogenic potentials. When compared to baseline data, post-exposure test results did not reveal any canalar damage. Pre- and post-exposure recordings of the vestibular-oculomotor reflex threshold have shown no significant changes. Conversely, post-stimulus recordings have shown a significant increase in the amplitude of the vestibular evoked myogenic potential response, thus indicating a possible irritative involvement of the macular receptor. This result suggests a direct action upon the receptor by acoustic stimulation which could, therefore, be the underlying cause of vestibular symptoms reported by patients following exposure to sufficiently intense acoustic stimuli. Prior to this study. a questionnaire concerning the relationship between habitual disco visiting and audio-vestibular symptoms has been completed by 310 students at the University of Catanzaro. This survey revealed a significant incidence of vestibular symptoms due to acoustic stress (Tullio's phenomenon) which led us to hypothesise that balance disorders due to auditory stress are much more frequent than commonly held, particularly since, in many cases, diagnoses is unknown or not easy due to the difficult procedures by which these conditions are diagnosed."

Furthermore, possible links between these parameters and noise-induced hearing loss were aimed to be evaluated.METHODS: In the present study, blood samples were obtained from all subjects after overnight fasting for biochemical analysis. We examined the levels of homocysteine, Vitamin B12 and folic acid levels in subjects with noise-induced hearing loss. Twenty-eight male patients with noise-induced hearing loss (mean age 37 +/- 5 year) were included in the study group whereas the control group was composed of 32 healthy male volunteers (mean age 36 +/- 4 year).RESULTS: It was found that homocysteine levels of subjects with noise-induced hearing loss as significantly high compared to healthy controls (P &lt; 0.05). On the other hand, Vitamin B12 and folic acid levels of patients with noise-induced hearing loss were determined to be significantly low compared to the controls (P &lt; 0.05 and &lt; 0.01, respectively).CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that there might be a link between increased homocysteine levels and noise-induced hearing loss. Since increased homocysteine levels cause elevated levels of free radicals in addition to its atherogenic and thrombogenic effects. Further experimental studies are needed to decipher how this relationship is linked."
"15035560","Modelling the risk of noise-induced hearing loss among military pilots.","Noise is a significant risk factor in aviation, especially in military aviation. Even though our earlier studies have shown that the risk of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) among military pilots is small and the monitoring of their hearing is effective, we still need to develop methods of assessing the risk of NIHL more effectively at both the general and individual levels. In addition, many other risk factors are considered to contribute to the development of hearing impairment. The novel NoiseScan data management system enables assessment of the risk of developing hearing impairment on the basis of known risk factors. This study investigates the risk of hearing impairment among Finnish Air Force pilots using reasonably accurate noise exposure data and other risk factors for hearing impairment. This risk is also compared with that of industrial workers, whose risk followed the ISO 1999 prediction. Hearing among Finnish military pilots turned out to be better than predicted by the ISO 1999 model. The industrial workers had a larger number of risk factors than the pilots. Owing to the small number of risk factors, the hearing of pilots corresponds to approximately the 80th percentile, being 9-13 dB better than the 50th percentile obtained with the industrial population."
"14992850","The contribution of focus groups in the evaluation of hearing conservation program (HCP) effectiveness.","PROBLEM: Exclusive reliance on such practices as policy review, audiometric testing audits, and noise surveillance to evaluate the effectiveness of workplace hearing conservation programs (HCP) fails to capture the impact of these programs as experienced by workers at the &quot;shop floor&quot; and offers little insight into the reasons and potential remedies for noted deficiencies.METHODS: A qualitative approach for evaluating industrial HCPs (and their various components) is discussed using three industrial populations as case studies. For each study population, this paper illustrates how focus groups, comprised of line workers and supervisors, were used to clarify and augment information gathered through more traditional program assessments to provide a more enriched picture of hearing conservation practices. Descriptive data on plant hearing conservation program practices at each plant are presented with a comparison of proactive elements of each program relative to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hearing Conservation Amendment (HCA) requirement and to internal plant policy.RESULTS: Yearly program evaluation with input from all end-users is important in the process of hearing loss prevention. The qualitative assessment outlined in this paper serves as a basis for future quantitative assessments of HCP effectiveness using hearing threshold data and noise exposure assessments to examine changes in hearing levels as a function of noise exposure and other risk factors for hearing loss."

The level of noise exposure in the venues where they work has also been studied using Ametek Mk-3 audio dosimeters. Three members of the study group showed clear evidence of noise-induced hearing loss on audiometry, 70 per cent reported temporary threshold shift after sessions and 74 per cent reported tinnitus. Sound levels of up to 108 dB(A) were recorded in the nightclubs. The average level for a typical session was 96 dB(A) which is above the level at which the provision of ear protection is mandatory for employers in industry. It can be concluded that DJs are at substantial risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss and noise exposure in nightclubs frequently exceeds safe levels."

His ear canal has a diameter of more than 1.3 cm. and determine a peculiar pattern of hearing loss, similar to the noise induced one, but chiefly in the speech frequencies. According to experimental and human studies we speculate that in this patient the peculiar morphology of the audiogram, with the low or mean frequencies maximally affected, may been explained by a synergistic effect of solvents mixture in conjunction with noise exposure and a high ear canal volume."
"14964507","Navy Hearing Conservation Program: 1995-1999 retrospective analysis of threshold shifts for age, sex, and officer/enlisted status.","This study provides a cross-sectional, population-based analysis of significant threshold shifts (STS) from over 83,000 audiograms on active duty members in the Navy Hearing Conservation Program Database for 1995-1999. Crude STS rates were lower for women than men (odds ration [OR], 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-0.89; p = 0.0000) and lower for officer than enlisted (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.66-0.76; p = 0.000000). STS rates also increased significantly with increasing age (chi2 for trend, 134; p = 0.0000). Compared with historical information, STS rates for officers were significantly lower (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.18-0.27; p = 0.00000). Adjustment by logistic regression found STS rates were lower for women (OR, 0.837; 95% CI, 0.773-0.905; p = 0.000) and officer status (OR, 0.670; 95% CI, 0.619-0.725; p = 0.0000), and increased significantly with age. These findings warrant further investigation because they have programmatic implications on Navy hearing conservation and force health protection."
"14960048","Speech intelligibility with helicopter noise: tests of three helmet-mounted communication systems.","BACKGROUND: Military aviator helmet communications systems are designed to enhance speech intelligibility (SI) in background noise and reduce exposure to harmful levels of noise. Some aviators, over the course of their aviation career, develop noise-induced hearing loss that may affect their ability to perform required tasks. New technology can improve SI in noise for aviators with normal hearing as well as those with hearing loss.METHODS: SI in noise scores were obtained from 40 rotary-wing aviators (20 with normal hearing and 20 with hearing-loss waivers). There were three communications systems evaluated: a standard SPH-4B, an SPH-4B aviator helmet modified with communications earplug (CEP), and an SPH-4B modified with active noise reduction (ANR).RESULTS: Subjects' SI was better in noise with newer technologies than with the standard issue aviator helmet. A significant number of aviators on waivers for hearing loss performed within the range of their normal hearing counterparts when wearing the newer technology. The rank order of perceived speech clarity was 1) CEP, 2) ANR, and 3) unmodified SPH-4B.CONCLUSIONS: To insure optimum SI in noise for rotary-wing aviators, consideration should be given to retrofitting existing aviator helmets with new technology, and incorporating such advances in communication systems of the future. Review of standards for determining fitness to fly is needed."
"14763230","Effects of discotheque music on audiometric results and central acoustic evoked neuromagnetic responses.","Audiograms and auditory evoked magnetic fields (AEFs) were observed in young male and female adults at different ages before and after being exposed to discotheque music for 4 hours. Sound pressure levels (SPLs) ranged from 95 dB (SPL) up to 130 dB (SPL). After exposure, subjects had temporary threshold shifts up to 20-25 dB, which almost disappeared after 2 hours. The majority of the subjects suffered from tinnitus that lasted approximately as long as the temporary threshold shift. Correspondingly, a transient delay and prolongation of the main component of the acoustically evoked magnetic field (AEF) negative wave, occurring 100 msec after stimulus (N100 m), was seen after this exposure; other components of the AEF (positive wave, occurring 50, 160, and 200 msec after stimulus [P50 m, P160 m, and P200 m, respectively]) occurred less often as compared to nonexposed controls. Because effects of vigilance on the AEF could be excluded, these changes can be related to the loud music, indicating an influence of noise on central auditory processing. The transient tinnitus could be caused by acoustic microinjuries (hidden acoustic predamage) of outer hair cells, leading to the persistent hearing threshold shifts from which many young adults aged 20-24 years are suffering. Occurrence of tinnitus closely coincides with the changes in hearing threshold and AEF, thus, a limitation of loudness in discotheques is needed to prevent this kind of hearing hazard."
"16377998","Estimating noise-induced permanent threshold shift from audiometric shape: the ISO-1999 model.","OBJECTIVE: To describe the relation between audiometric shape and noise-induced permanent threshold shift averaged across the speech frequencies (N5123).DESIGN: Using an international standard (ISO-1999), 270 audiograms were created, representing both sexes and a variety of ages, exposure levels, and percentiles. Bulge depth (BD) was defined as the difference between pure-tone average for 2, 3, and 4 kHz and PTA for 1 and 6 kHz.RESULTS: N5123 was well-predicted by quadratic functions of BD, which accounted for 72 to 95% of the variance in N5123.CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of N5123, based on BD, can be helpful in medical-legal diagnosis and allocation of hearing loss."

Of all noise-exposed worker population, about ten percent are hypersensitive to noise. Regular hearing tests conducted for two years revealed a hearing impairment in a young construction plumber who, according to on-site noise measurements, was occupationally exposed to permissible noise levels. Tonal hearing tests showed that the impairment was progressing quickly. This case study discusses probable causes of this lesion suffered by the subject, which is of the acoustic trauma type."
"16370263","Hearing loss in military aviation and other trades: investigation of prevalence and risk factors.","INTRODUCTION: Continuous increase in the cost of claims for noise-induced hearing loss in Canadian Forces personnel prompted a review of hearing conservation practices. Investigations comprised retrospective analyses of hearing test results and a prospective survey of risk factors for hearing loss.METHOD: There were 1057 individuals working in 107 air, land, and sea trades who contributed their current and first hearing test results. Subjects completed a 64-item questionnaire relating to demographics, occupational and non-occupational noise exposure history, training in and use of hearing protection, and non-noise risk factors, including head injury, ear disease, medications, and solvent exposure. Subject recruitment, hearing assessment, and questionnaire distribution were carried out by military personnel. Apparatus and protocols for hearing testing conformed to current clinical practice.RESULTS: Prevalence of moderate to severe hearing loss progressed with age, with hearing thresholds in those over 45 yr ranging broadly from normal to over 70 dB HL. Unprotected exposure to noise and solvents appeared to be the likely determinates of adverse outcome. Head injury, ear disease, and the use of ototoxic medications had minimal impact. The data for individuals in 17 selected trades in the 3 environments modeled that of the total sample.DISCUSSION: Responses to the questionnaire suggested that training on noise hazard and selection and use of hearing protection were inadequate. Hearing protection was reported to be incompatible with other gear, uncomfortable, and an impediment to communication. Approaches for upgrading hearing conservation strategies, including the creation of end-user focus groups, were considered."
"16295567","Perceived industrial deafness and hearing loss among people in a small Queensland rural community.","This paper aims to describe chronic diseases including hearing loss reported by people in a small rural community. It will present the results of audiometric screening among a group of people in this community and their self reported risk factors of hearing loss. Different risk factors experienced by men and women will be compared. Two surveys were conducted in a small Queensland rural community. The first survey gathered information relating to chronic diseases among 604 people using a telephone interview method. The second survey assessed the level of hearing among 64 people who presented themselves for audiometric screening, their history of exposure to loud noise and their previous use of hearing protective measures. A higher rate of &quot;industrial deafness&quot; was reported (110.75 per 1,000 population) than the 1995 National rate (95.2 per 1,000 population). Of 64 people who attended the audiometric assessment, 60 (93.8%) had some level of hearing loss using the 2000 International Standard of hearing level (ISO 7029: 2000) taking age and gender into account. However, 15 persons (23.4%) perceived that they had good hearing. When compared to ISO 7029: 2000 standard, men and women had a similar pattern of hearing loss. Compared to men, a lower percentage of women were exposed to different sources of loud noise and were less likely to use hearing protection devices."
"16281759","[Annual rate of development of noise induced hearing loss in exposed workers].","The rate of development of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) in a group of 150 male workers exposed to industrial noise of over 85 dBA, was compared with the rate of a group of 40 unexposed workers. It was found that while the average annual rate of decline in the exposed group (for frequencies 1000-4000 HZ) was about 1 dB/year, it was less than 0.5 dB/ year in the unexposed group. These findings attest to the need to improve current prevention modalities (hearing conservation programs). In addition, the findings point to the importance of guaranteeing the accuracy of the audiometric tests as the usual &quot;measurement error&quot; is often greater than the expected real change (1-2 dB/year). These findings also question the value of current annual audiometry (a statutory requirement) in relation to providing significant new information."
"16262144","[Status of noise in small-scale factories having press machines and hearing loss in workers].","A study on noise and hearing loss was conducted in 36 small-scale factories where press machinery is actively used. Noise levels in working environments were measured in 34 factories. Of those measured, two (6%), eight (24%) and 24 (71%) factories were classified into control classes I, II and III, respectively, according to guidelines established for the prevention of noise-related disorders. Furthermore, personal exposure levels to noise were measured for 23 workers. Twenty-one (91%) of those workers measured were exposed to 85 dB(A) or higher, (the occupational exposure limit for an 8-hour exposure period). Maximum exposure levels were found to be at 102 dB (A). Hearing tests were then conducted on 97 male workers at those 36 factory sites. Twenty (21%), 30 (31%) and 10 (10%) of the workers measured were classified into a &quot;precursory symptom group&quot;, a &quot;slight hearing loss group&quot; and a &quot;medium to serious hearing loss group&quot;, respectively, based on the aforementioned guidelines. It was found that as workers' ages increased, the percentage of workers having some degree of hearing loss increased. Specifically, it was found that there was some level of hearing loss for 93% of those studied aged in their 50's, and up to 100% in those aged in their 60's."

Noise-induced hearing loss was diagnosed in 49% of cases (&quot;pure&quot; in 27% and mixed--with the concurrence of other causes--in 22% of cases). These unexpected data indicate that electric lines maintenance should be considered a high risk occupation for noise-induced damage, and confirm the need of enforcing current protective laws."
"16177883","Potential occupational health problems for dentists in Flanders, Belgium.","The aim of this study was to gather data on occupational health effects among Flemish dentists. A questionnaire on various potential health effects was sent out to randomly selected Flemish dentists. Pilot experimental studies were performed on hearing and sensory function of the fingers on small groups of dentists. Audiometric data of both ears, gathered with an interval of 10 years, were analysed. Sensory tests of the fingers were performed for dominant and non-dominant hands in relation to exposure time to (ultra)sonic equipment. Positive responses for the questionnaire were as follows: low back pain, 54% (stress-correlated); vision problems, 52.3% (age-correlated); infections, 9%; allergies, 22.5% (mainly latex); stress level was scored 7 on a scale from 0 to 10; diminished sensitivity of the fingertips, 6% and auditory disorders, 19.6%. Pilot audiometric data showed a hearing loss at 4,000 Hz for the left ear, presumably indicative of occupational noise trauma. The two-point discrimination ability of the dominant hand tended to diminish in line with the number of years of practice. Dentists in Flanders were found to suffer from various health-related problems. More elaborate studies are required to provide more details on the risks for occupational hearing impairment and vibration hand neuropathy and to determine whether the problems described were related to the practice of dentistry."
"16112827","Distortion-product otoacoustic emission spectra and high-resolution audiometry in noise-induced hearing loss.","Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) elicited by 60dB SPL pure tones at f1 and f2 were collected at 2f1-f2, in 1/10th octave steps, in a sample of 36 ears from 27 patients with noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). They were analyzed in the frequency domain against the outcome of high-resolution pure-tone audiometry, performed with the help of a Bksy sweep-frequency automatic audiometer. The characteristics of DPOAE level plots as a function of frequency (the so-called DP-grams), relative to the DPOAE levels of a control age-matched group, were compared to their alleged counterparts on the audiograms, i.e., the lower and upper frequency boundaries of the interval with hearing loss. Ears with NIHL split into two subgroups, one (n = 25) with a notch in the DP-gram such that its lower boundary matched the lower limit of the audiometric notch (linear regression with a slope of 0.91, r(2) = 0.644, p &lt; 0.001). Likewise, when it existed, its upper boundary matched its upper counterpart on the audiogram (linear regression with a slope of 0.96, r(2) = 0.89, p &lt; 0.001). In this respect, DP-grams performed better than transient-evoked OAE spectra, which exhibited poor correlations with audiogram patterns. The second subgroup (n = 11) exhibited normal DPOAEs at all frequencies despite audiometric losses similar to those of the first subgroup. In all cases, DPOAE levels were poor predictors of the degree of hearing losses. It is hypothesized that NIHL in the second subgroup involves inner hair cells or auditory neurons, instead of outer hair cells in the first subgroup. Provided NIHL affected outer hair cells, DP-grams provided a comparatively accurate predictor of the spectral extent of hearing loss."
"16111421","Extended high-frequency audiometry in patients with acoustic trauma.","OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine extended high-frequency (EHF) hearing in patients with acoustic trauma.DESIGN: A prospective, case-control study in a group of soldiers with acoustic trauma caused by shooting practice during basic training.SETTING: Tertiary referral centre.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 39 young soldiers hospitalized for hearing loss and tinnitus following exposure to weapon impulse noise were studied. Conventional audiometry in the frequency range 0.25-8 kHz and EHF audiometry in the frequency range 9-20 kHz were performed, both on admittance and before discharge. Thirty healthy recruits of similar age and sex were used as controls.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pure-tone threshold changes documented by conventional and EHF audiometry.RESULTS: The most significant differences in pure-tone thresholds on initial testing were found in the frequency range 0.25-11.2 kHz, and especially in the 4-8 kHz region. Reduction in thresholds across most frequencies was observed after treatment, although recovery was partial in most cases.CONCLUSIONS: The EHF audiometry adds no significant additional information to conventional pure-tone audiometry in assessing and monitoring noise-induced hearing loss."
"16105249","Combined effects of noise and styrene on hearing: comparison between active and sedentary rats.","In this study, two investigations were carried out with adult Long-Evans rats exposed to increasing concentrations of styrene. In the first experiment, the hearing of rats, which were forced to walk in a special wheel during the exposure, was compared to that of rats which were sleepy in their cage. The active rats were exposed to styrene concentrations ranging from 300 to 600 ppm, whereas the sedentary rats were exposed from 500 to 1000 ppm for 4 weeks, 5 days per week, 6 hours per day. In the second experiment, designed to evaluate the hearing risks at threshold limit values, active rats were exposed either to a noise having a Leq8h of 85 dB (equivalent level of a continuous noise for a typical 8-h workday), or to 400-ppm styrene or to a simultaneous exposure to noise and styrene. In both experiments, auditory function was tested by auditory-evoked potentials from the inferior colliculus and completed by morphological analyses of the organ of Corti. The results of the first experiment showed that the same amount of styrene-induced hearing loss can be obtained by using concentrations approximately 200 ppm lower in active rats than in sedentary rats. The second investigation showed that, in spite of the low-intensity noise and the low-concentration of styrene, there is a clear risk of potentiation of styrene-induced hearing loss by noise. These findings and exposure conditions were discussed and extrapolated with regard to the risk assessment for human beings. The authors propose to decrease the French threshold limit value of styrene for ensuring a high level of protection for human hearing."
"16021464","Hearing loss among operating engineers in American construction industry.","OBJECTIVE: Occupational noise exposure and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) among construction workers has long been recognized as a problem in the United States, yet little is known about the prevalence of NIHL among American construction workers. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of hearing loss among operating engineers (OEs) who operate heavy construction machinery.METHOD: As a part of hearing protection intervention, an audiometric test was conducted for both ears at frequencies 0.5 through 8 kHz in the soundproof booth. Prior to the audiometric test, a paper-pencil pre-hearing test questionnaire was administered and an otoscopic examination was completed. Prevalence of hearing loss was determined based on hearing threshold levels (HTLs) in the worst ear with a low fence of 25 dB.RESULT: A total of 623 workers were included in the analysis and they were predominantly middle-aged Caucasian males (mean age = 43 years, Caucasian = 90%, male = 92%). Over 60% of OEs showed hearing loss in the noise-sensitive higher frequencies of 4 and 6 kHz. The rate of hearing loss was particularly higher among workers who reported longer years of working in the construction industry. Workers showed significantly poorer hearing in the left ear, and a typical characteristic of NIHL, a V-notch at 4 or 6 kHz, was not shown in this population. Thirty-eight percent reported ringing/buzzing in the ear and 62% indicated having problems in understanding what people say in loud noise. Average reported use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) was 48% of the time they were required to be used. Significant inverse relationship was found between higher frequency (4-6 kHz) hearing loss and use of HPDs (r =-0.134, p &lt; 0.001). Workers using HPDs more had significantly better hearing than those who did not.CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated a significant NIHL problem and low use of HPDs in OEs. An effective hearing conservation program, including a periodic audiometric testing and hearing protection intervention, for this study population should be in place."
"16018495","Pure tone audiograms and possible aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss in belugas (Delphinapterus leucas).","A behavioral response paradigm was used to measure pure-tone hearing sensitivities in two belugas (Delphinapterus leucas). Tests were conducted over a 20-month period at the Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium, in Tacoma, WA. Subjects were two males, aged 8-10 and 9-11 during the course of the study. Subjects were born in an oceanarium and had been housed together for all of their lives. Hearing thresholds were measured using a modified up/down staircase procedure and acoustic response paradigm where subjects were trained to produce audible responses to test tones and to remain quiet otherwise. Test frequencies ranged from approximately 2 to 130 kHz. Best sensitivities ranged from approximately 40 to 50 dB re 1 microPa at 50-80 kHz and 30-35 kHz for the two subjects. Although both subjects possessed traditional &quot;U-shaped&quot; mammalian audiograms, one subject exhibited significant high-frequency hearing loss above 37 kHz compared to previously published data for belugas. Hearing loss in this subject was estimated to approach 90 dB for frequencies above 50 kHz. Similar ages, ancestry, and environmental conditions between subjects, but a history of ototoxic drug administration in only one subject, suggest that the observed hearing loss was a result of the aminoglycoside antibiotic amikacin."
"15998194","Tinnitus and hearing loss in hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) exposed to loud sound.","Hamsters were trained to go left and right to sounds on their left and right sides, respectively. Silent trials were occasionally given in which no sound was presented. Hamsters exposed to a loud 2- or 10-kHz tone in 1 ear often shifted their responding on the silent trials to the side of the exposed ear, suggesting that they perceived a sound in that ear (i.e., tinnitus). The degree of tinnitus was related to the degree of the accompanying hearing loss (estimated by the auditory brainstem response). However, a conductive hearing loss (plugging 1 ear) did not cause a hamster to test positive for tinnitus. Tinnitus could be demonstrated within minutes following tone exposure, indicating an immediate onset, as occurs in humans."
"15989167","Ethnic differences in predictors of hearing protection behavior between Black and White workers.","The purpose of the study is to determine whether there are ethnic differences in predictors of hearing protection behavior between Black and White workers. The Predictors of Use of Hearing Protection Model (PUHPM) derived from Pender's Health Promotion Model (Pender, 1987) was used as a conceptual model. A total of 2,119 (297 Blacks, 1,822 Whites) were included in the analysis. Internal consistency of instrument items was assessed using theta reliability estimates. Significant predictors of the use of hearing protective devices (HPDs) for Black and White workers and differences in predictors between the two groups were examined using multiple regression with interaction terms. Ethnic differences in scale or individual item scores were assessed using chi-square and t-test analyses. Different factors influenced hearing protection behavior among Black and White workers. The model was much less predictive of Blacks' hearing protection behavior than Whites' (R2 = .12 vs. .36). Since the PUHPM was not as effective in predicting hearing protection behavior for Blacks as for Whites, future studies are needed to expand the PUHPM through qualitative study and to develop culturally appropriate models to identify factors that better predict hearing protection behavior as a basis for developing effective interventions."
"15937413","Hearing levels of firefighters: risk of occupational noise-induced hearing loss assessed by cross-sectional and longitudinal data.","OBJECTIVE: It is well known that firefighters face serious risk to their health and safety in the performance of their duties. To determine whether individuals who work as firefighters sustain occupational noise-induced hearing losses, we evaluated results of hearing tests completed by firefighters and compared them with age-matched, non-occupationally exposed groups of individuals.DESIGN: The results of annual audiometric testing and a related questionnaire collected as part of a company-wide hearing conservation program were obtained from two large urban fire departments. The records from 12,609 tests conducted over an 11-year period were evaluated. Hearing levels obtained from the tests were compared with age-matched control populations from an American national standard, and a longitudinal study comparing the rate of hearing loss to that expected due to presbycusis alone was conducted.RESULTS: Comparisons of the data to the national standard indicated that firefighters do not exhibit excessive loss of hearing compared with age-matched, non-occupationally exposed control subjects. The longitudinal study that examined the regression of firefighters' hearing with age compared with the expected presbycasic regression function indicated that the hearing of firefighters in the study declined over the 7-year period at a rate that was less than that expected due to age alone.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this large-scale, cross-sectional, and longitudinal study indicate that firefighters are not at risk for occupational noise-induced hearing loss, even though they work nonstandard shifts and are occasionally exposed to high levels of noise. The results are consistent with the findings but not the conclusions of several other studies of firefighters' hearing."
"15913156","Is there a relevant effect of noise and smoking on hearing? A population-based aging study.","The objectives of the present study were to evaluate both the respective and combined effects of occupational noise exposure and smoking on hearing, taking age into consideration. The evaluation was conducted using 1478 subjects without a history of ear disease out of a population-based sample of 2267 adults, aged 40 79 years. Pure-tone audiometry and a questionnaire were administered. A deleterious effect of noise exposure on hearing was significantly observed in both genders at many frequencies after adjustment for age, income, and education. The smoking habit alone significantly affected hearing deterioration at 4000 Hz in noise-unexposed males. The combined effect of noise and smoking was not interactive but additive. A dose-response effect of smoking on hearing loss was observed in middle-aged males without noise exposure. Smoking and noise exposure were associated with hearing loss respectively.. This result is noteworthy for the preservation of good hearing especially at the beginning of aging."
"15913155","Recreational noise exposure and its effects on the hearing of adolescents. Part II: development of hearing disorders.","Part II, continuation of a previous paper, describes the significant hearing threshold shift found during the third year of the long-term study, which continued to be present in the fourth year, in a number of adolescents classified as Subgroup 2, who showed a higher mean HTL in the middle and especially in the high frequency ranges than the rest of the studied adolescents, classified as Subgroup 1. In both subgroups, the subjects showed high participation in recreational activities; nevertheless, the adolescents in Subgroup 2 showed higher participation in some of them in the last year of the study. From the beginning of the study, the mean HTL of the adolescents in Subgroup 2 was higher than the mean HTL of the adolescents in Subgroup 1. The exposure to high sound levels during leisure activities can be a cause of permanent hearing damage among young people with 'tender ears'."
"15913154","Recreational noise exposure and its effects on the hearing of adolescents. Part I: an interdisciplinary long-term study.","This interdisciplinary long-term study examined the effects of recreational noise exposure on the hearing of adolescents. Boys and girls (aged 14-17 years) were examined during a four-year period. Audiological, psychosocial, and sound measurements were performed yearly to determine the hearing threshold level (HTL) of participants in the 250-16000 Hz range, their participation in recreational activities, and the sound levels at discos and through personal music player use. A tendency of the mean HTL to increase in both genders during the study was observed, especially at 14000 Hz and 16000 Hz. Boys had a higher mean HTL than girls. The participation in musical activities increased yearly, 'attendance at discos' being the favourite musical activity for both groups. In general, boys were more exposed to high sound levels than girls. The equivalent sound levels in discos ranged between 104.3 and 112.4 dBA, and between 75 and 105 dBA from personal music players."
"15895144","[Prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss in metallurgical company].","OBJECTIVE: To analyze the prevalence of cases suggestive of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) among metalworkers who were potentially exposed to occupational noise (from 83 to 102 dB).METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in a metalworking company providing services in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Clinical and occupational data on 182 workers who were active between November 2001 and March 2002 were obtained from the company's Hearing Conservation Program and analyzed. In order to characterize the noise exposure status within the work environment, the acoustic classifications from the operating units of the client companies were used, due to difficulty in quantification at an individual level. Associations between these cases and variables such as age, length of service in the company, length of exposure to occupational noise and degree of use of individual protection equipment were tested by means of prevalence ratios and logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: The prevalence of cases suggestive of NIHL was 15.9% and significant associations (p&lt;0.05) were identified from multivariate analysis between these cases and the variables of age and degree of use of individual protection equipment.CONCLUSIONS: The results found contribute towards better understanding of the behavior of some of the main characteristics of NIHL, in a particular situation of the organizing of work that is relatively common in the Brazilian industrial context."
"15837852","Prospective noise induced changes to hearing among construction industry apprentices.","AIMS: To characterise the development of noise induced damage to hearing.METHODS: Hearing and noise exposure were prospectively monitored among a cohort of newly enrolled construction industry apprentices and a comparison group of graduate students, using standard pure tone audiometry and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). A total of 328 subjects (632 ears) were monitored annually an average of 3.4 times. In parallel to these measures, noise exposure and hearing protection device (HPD) use were extensively monitored during construction work tasks. Recreational/non-occupational exposures also were queried and monitored in subgroups of subjects. Trade specific mean exposure L(eq) levels, with and without accounting for the variable use of hearing protection in each trade, were calculated and used to group subjects by trade specific exposure level. Mixed effects models were used to estimate the change in hearing outcomes over time for each exposure group.RESULTS: Small but significant exposure related changes in DPOAEs over time were observed, especially at 4 kHz with stimulus levels (L1) between 50 and 75 dB, with less clear but similar patterns observed at 3 kHz. After controlling for covariates, the high exposure group had annual changes in 4 kHz emissions of about 0.5 dB per year. Pure tone audiometric thresholds displayed only slight trends towards increased threshold levels with increasing exposure groups. Some unexpected results were observed, including an apparent increase in DPOAEs among controls over time, and improvement in behavioural thresholds among controls at 6 kHz only.CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that construction apprentices in their first three years of work, with average noise exposures under 90 dBA, have measurable losses of hearing function. Despite numerous challenges in using DPOAEs for hearing surveillance in an industrial setting, they appear somewhat more sensitive to these early changes than is evident with standard pure tone audiometry."
"15776468","Effect of tractor driving on hearing loss in farmers in India.","BACKGROUND: Indian tractor drivers operate their tractors and other implements/equipment in an environment which can have extreme temperatures and high level of suspended particulate matter. In addition, Indian tractors do not have adequate vibration and noise attenuating designs features. This cross-sectional study compares the hearing status of tractor driving farmers (TDFs) (study group) and non-tractor driving farmers (NTDFs) (control group) matched for age, sex, generic/ethnic group, land holding, education levels, and work routines.METHOD: Two groups of 50 experienced tractor-driving farmers and 50 non-driving farmers were selected from 2 villages, 50 km from Delhi. All participants were interviewed for details of work routine and noise exposures. An audiogram was performed and noise measurements taken on tractors and other machines.RESULTS: Self-reported hearing problems were similar (4 cases each) in both the groups of 50 farmers. However, audiogram analysis showed higher prevalence of abnormalities in TDFs. TDFs (24) had more often high frequency hearing loss when compared to NTDFs (14). The noise levels observed on tractors in different operations were in the range of 90-110 dB (A).CONCLUSIONS: Tractor noise levels exceeded the recommended safe limits of OSHA and NIOSH prescribed standards. TDFs had higher high frequency hearing loss than NTDFs. The mechanism of damage and prevention needs to be studied further."
"15703144","Critical period for styrene ototoxicity in the rat.","The current experiments were undertaken to determine whether or not styrene-induced hearing loss in the rat depends more on the existence of a critical period between 14 and 21 weeks of age than on body weight. For these purposes, two experiments were carried out with mature Long-Evans rats. In the first experiment, two groups of 5-month old rats, but having different body weight (slim: 314 g vs. fat: 415 g) were exposed to 700 ppm styrene for 4 consecutive weeks, 5 days per week, 6 hours per day. In the second experiment, two groups of rats having the same weight: 345 g, but different ages (14- vs. 21- week old) were exposed to styrene in strictly identical experimental conditions. Auditory sensitivity was tested by recording evoked potentials from the inferior colliculus. Surface preparations of the organ of Corti were also performed to complete the investigation. At the end of the six week recovery period following the styrene exposure, a 7 dB permanent threshold shift (PTS) was obtained with the same age animals regardless of the body weight. Consequently, weight was not a major factor in styrene-induced hearing loss. Age was a more critical factor in determining higher sensitivity to styrene. Indeed, the three months old group had 23.5 dB PTS, whereas the five months old group had only a 7.7 dB PTS at 16 kHz. Thus, a 15 dB difference of PTS was obtained between the rats having the same weight but different age. While the weight does not play a major role in styrene ototoxicity, there is a critical period whose duration lasts more than three months and for which the susceptibility to styrene is enhanced."
"15699090","Joint effects of smoking, noise exposure and age on hearing loss.","BACKGROUND: Smoking has been shown to have adverse effects on hearing, but it's unclear whether smoking interacts with known causes of hearing loss such as noise exposure and ageing.AIMS: To examine the hypothesis that smoking, noise and age jointly affect hearing acuity.METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out in 535 male adult workers of a metal processing factory. Pure-tone audiometric tests were utilized to assess hearing loss. Noise exposure assessment was based on a job exposure matrix constructed with industrial hygienist scoring and job titles. Each participant answered questionnaires about socio-demographic, life-style, occupational and health-related data. Analysis of the possible underlying biological model was undertaken assessing departures from additivity using measures of the size of the interaction present.RESULTS: Age and occupational noise exposures were, separately, positively associated with hearing loss. For all the factors combined the estimated effect on hearing loss was higher than the sum of the effects from each isolated variable, especially for smoking and noise among those 20-40 years of age, and for smoking and age among those non-exposed to occupational noise.CONCLUSIONS: The synergistic effect of smoking, noise exposure and age on hearing loss, found in this study, is consistent with the biological interaction. Furthermore, it is possible that distinct ototoxic substances in the chemical composition of mainstream smoke may synergistically affect hearing when in combination with noise exposure, which needs to be examined in future studies."
"15692300","Longitudinal study of pure-tone thresholds in older persons.","OBJECTIVE: Pure-tone thresholds for conventional and extended high frequencies were analyzed for 188 older adult human subjects (91 females, 97 males). The objectives were to study longitudinal changes in thresholds as well as the effects of initial threshold levels, age, gender, and noise history on these longitudinal changes.DESIGN: At the time of entry into the study, subjects' ages ranged from 60 to 81 years, with a mean age of 68 years. Subjects had between 2 and 21 visits (mean = 9.81 visits) over a period of 3 to 11.5 years (mean = 6.40 years). Conventional pure-tone thresholds at 0.25 to 8 kHz were measured during most visits. Extended high-frequency (EHF) thresholds at 9 to 18 kHz were measured every 2 to 3 years. The slope of a linear regression was used to estimate the rate of change in pure-tone thresholds at 0.25 to 18 kHz for each ear. A questionnaire was used to identify those subjects with a positive noise history.RESULTS: The average rate of change in thresholds was 0.7 dB per year at 0.25 kHz, increasing gradually to 1.2 dB per year at 8 kHz and 1.23 dB per year at 12 kHz. The rate of change for thresholds increased significantly with age, at 0.25 to 3, 10, and 11 kHz for females and at 6 kHz for males. After adjusting for age, females had a significantly slower rate of change at 1 kHz but a significantly faster rate of change at 6 to 12 kHz than males. For 0.25 and 1 kHz, subjects with more hearing loss at higher frequencies had a faster rate of change at these frequencies, whereas for 6 and 8 kHz, subjects with more hearing loss at mid and high frequencies had a slower rate of change at these frequencies. The rates of threshold change for subjects with a positive noise history were not statistically different from those with a negative noise history.CONCLUSIONS: On average, hearing threshold increased approximately 1 dB per year for subjects age 60 and over. Age, gender, and initial threshold levels can affect the rate of change in thresholds. Older female subjects (&gt; or =70 years) had faster rate of change at 0.25 to 3, 10, and 11 kHz than younger female subjects (60 to 69 years). Older male subjects had faster rate of change at 6 kHz than younger male subjects. Females had a slower rate of change at 1 kHz and a faster rate of change at 6 to 12 kHz than males. Subjects with higher initial thresholds at low and mid frequencies tended to have faster rate of threshold change at 0.25 to 2 kHz in the following years. Subjects with higher initial thresholds at mid and higher frequencies tended to have slower rate of change at 6 to 8 kHz in the following years. Noise history did not have a significant effect on the rate of threshold changes."
"15666020","[Effects on hearing due to the occupational noise exposure of marble industry workers in the Federal District, Brazil].","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of hearing loss, its degree and type, among workers in the marble industry in the Brazilian Federal District (FD).METHOD: Workers from eight marble industries in the FD were evaluated by means of a cross sectional epidemiological study. An audiometry screening test (air conduction) was performed. Workers with hearing loss were submitted to liminal tonal audiometry air &amp; bone conduction and speech audiometry tests using an audiometer AD-28 (Interacoustics). All subjects studied were submitted to a visual inspection of the external acoustic meatus.RESULTS: One hundred and fifty two workers were examined; mean age was 32 years (SD = 8.6); average occupational noise exposure was of 8.3 years (SD = 6.8). Audiometries demonstrated that 48.0% (n = 73) had some type of hearing loss. Among the workers with hearing loss, 50.0% had results compatible with noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL); 41.0% with incipient noise induced hearing loss, 5.0% with sensorineural hearing loss (all except NIHL) and 4.0% with conductive and mixed hearing losses. Among workers with NIHL, 57.1% had bilateral involvement, 17.1% in the right ear and 25.7% in the left ear. Among those with incipient NIHL, 13.9% were bilateral, 19.4% were only in the right ear and 66.7% were only in the left ear.CONCLUSION: Abnormal audiograms were found in 48.0% of the sample. Among those with hearing loss, the predominant cause was NIHL, followed by those classified as having incipient noise induced hearing loss. Hearing loss usually started at 6 kHz, frequently in the left ear."
"15657749","[Quality control of audiologic results in a university phoniatric/pediatric institution. An example of expert assessment of occupational noise induced hearing loss].","AIM: An investigation was made to reveal whether suspicion of occupational hearing loss can be satisfactorily determined by an otolaryngologist or workplace audiological measurement. These were compared with a formal audiometrical assessment at a university clinic.METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective study was made of 95 cases of noise induced hearing loss. A total of 78 individuals were investigated by an otolaryngologist and 70 by workplace audiometry. Using workplace audiometry, 27% of the tests showed a reduction in working capacity of at least 20%. In only five of these was a specialist opinion sought within a year. In 50%, this took longer than 5 years. A comparison of audiometric data from expert opinion revealed that there was conformity in only 47% with workplace audiometry and 48% with otolaryngologist testing. In some cases (27% workplace and 33% ENT practice), the measured hearing loss and calculation of disability exceeded that determined by the experts.CONCLUSIONS: The results of workplace audiometry demonstrated that hearing loss was frequently reported only after the workers had received a disability of at least 20%. Possible reasons for discrepancies in audiological testing might be the exaggeration of hearing loss by the worker, insufficient recovery time after noise exposure, or inexperienced audiologists. Our data show that audiometric testing in workplace audiometry, as well as in ENT practice, often reveal a higher disability rating compared to formal audiological (university) assessment, even if these discrepancies do not reach statistical significance."
"15654455","[Combined exposure to noise and vibration and its effects on workers' hearing].","OBJECTIVE: To assess the exposure of bus drivers to noise and whole-body vibration (WBV) and to examine the possibility of an association between these risk factors for noise-induced hearing loss.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out among 141 bus drivers who underwent an audiometry test. This group was classified and internally stratified in subgroups of &quot;exposed&quot; and &quot;controls&quot; according to cumulative working time as bus drivers. Their exposure to noise and vibration was assessed. The association between noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and the set of explanatory variables was analyzed through logistic regression.RESULTS: The average (+/- standard deviation) weekly noise exposure of front-engine bus drivers was 83.6 +/- 1.9 dB(A), while rear-engine bus drivers were exposed to 77.0 +/- 1.1 dB(A). The weighted average of vibration acceleration was 0.85/m(2). In the best adjusted model, the multivariable analysis showed that age (&gt;44; OR=2.54; 95% CI=1.15-5.62), diabetes (OR=5.46; 95% CI=0.95-31.4), and the level of noise emission [&gt;86.8 dB(A); OR=2.76; 95% CI=1.24-6.15] were risk factors for NIHL. In another model studied, WBV exposure was significant in determining NIHL.CONCLUSIONS: Bus drivers were exposed to significant WBV levels. The noise exposure was more pronounced in front engine than in rear-engine vehicles. No association between WBV exposure and NIHL was observed and no interaction was found between WBV and noise exposure. Further studies are required as other model indicated an association between WBV and NIHL."
"17184014","[Effect of smoking withdrawal on hearing loss induced by occupational exposure to noise. A preliminary study].","Smoking and occupational exposure to noise are factors with independent predisposition to sensorineural hearing loss. This is a sinergistic and additive effect. Nevertheless, we have observed that withdrawal of smoking stops the progression on hearing loss in occupational groups with an acoustic exposition lesser than 80 dB SPL. Actually, there is not an unique ethiologic hypothesis."
"17175514","Evaluation of noise attenuation and verbal communication capabilities using three ear insert hearing protection systems among airport maintenance personnel.","The goal of this project was to determine whether one type of earplug would allow a user to hear communication in a noisy environment better than two other types of earplugs. The three types of earplugs studied are newly available on the market. Sonomax SonoCustoms are custom fitted to the user. E-A-R Push-Ins are the newest form of foam earplugs, and Howard Leight SmartFits have an adaptable shape. One of the earplug manufacturers claimed to have improved verbal communications due to the design of the earplug. We hypothesized that the type of earplug providing better communication properties would have lower attenuation around the communication frequencies compared with the other types. To test this hypothesis, we used speech intelligibility and attenuation tests in the laboratory on 26 subjects, and real-time video exposure monitoring in the field (airport maintenance personnel) for visual communication cues. ANCOVA was used to analyze the data from the laboratory study. The type of earplug worn was not significant in the model (p-value 0.0849), nor was attenuation of the earplug (p-value 0.2379). Further analysis showed that attenuation did not differ significantly among earplugs (p-value 0.5903). Logistic regression was used to analyze the data from the field study. Again, the type of earplug was not significant in the model (p-value 0.0965). A comfort questionnaire determined that Howard Leight SmartFits and the E-A-R Push-Ins were more comfortable and easier to use than the Sonomax HPDs (p-value &lt;0.0001). We found a definite difference between manufacturers' attenuation data and our attenuation data, especially in the frequencies for 125-1000 Hz. Also, there was no difference in frequency and overall attenuation among the HPDs. This resulted in no difference in communication abilities among the types of HPDs."
"17147841","Temporary threshold shift due to recreational firearm use.","OBJECTIVE: To assess whether a temporary threshold shift occurred after recreational firearm use.DESIGN: An observational study of 25 subjects using ear protection in an indoor rifle range. Hearing was evaluated before and after shooting five rounds with a 0.22 calibre rifle over 10 minutes. A threshold shift of 5 dB was found to be statistically significant, while a shift of 10 dB was clinically significant.RESULTS: Twenty-four candidates had a statistically significant threshold shift, while 12 had a clinically significant threshold shift. Two subjects with previous industrial noise exposure had threshold shifts at more frequencies than other subjects. There was no significant preference for either ear. One subject showed no changes.CONCLUSION: This small study sheds some light on impulse noise behaviour in an indoor shooting range, but no definite conclusions can be drawn. The side of shooting did not influence threshold changes in either ear."
"17139737","Modeling distortion product otoacoustic emission input/output functions using segmented regression.","Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) are low-level acoustic signals, the detection of which involves extraction from a background of noise. Boege and Janssen [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 111, 1810-1818 (2002)] described a method for modeling the presence and growth of these responses. While improving growth function parameter estimation, this technique excludes a significant fraction of the data (especially low-level responses), and relies on ad hoc model fit acceptance criteria. The statistical difficulties associated with these limitations are described, and a weighted segmented linear regression model that avoids them is proposed. A simple test is presented for the presence of DPOAE growth. This technique is compared to that of Boege and Janssen in a dataset of 9 556 input/output (I/O) functions collected over 4 years on 866 ears from 379 construction apprentices and 63 age-matched controls. Comparisons are made on the entire dataset and within audiometric hearing loss categories. Segmented regression avoids the statistical pitfalls of the previous method, allows estimation of the threshold and slope of auditory response on a far greater number of I/O functions, and improves estimation of these parameters in this dataset. The potential for this method to yield more sensitive metrics of hearing function and compromise is discussed."
"17114139","Residual inhibition functions in relation to tinnitus spectra and auditory threshold shift.","CONCLUSIONS: Psychoacoustic functions relating the depth and duration of tinnitus suppression ('residual inhibition') to the center frequency of band-passed noise masking sounds appear to span the region of hearing loss, as do psychoacoustic measurements of the tinnitus spectrum. The results (1) suggest that cortical map reorganization induced by hearing loss is not the principal source of the tinnitus sensation and (2) provide a necessary baseline for optimizing residual inhibition in individual cases.OBJECTIVE: To measure residual inhibition functions and tinnitus spectra using sounds spanning the region of hearing loss.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three subject-driven, computer-based tools were developed and applied to measure psychoacoustic properties of tinnitus and residual inhibition in 32 subjects with chronic tonal, ringing, or hissing tinnitus. Residual inhibition functions were measured with band-passed noise sounds varying in center frequency up to 12.0 kHz.RESULTS: The depth and duration of residual inhibition increased with the center frequency of the band-passed noise stimuli. Near-elimination of tinnitus for up to 45 s was reported by 8/24 (33%) subjects at center frequencies above 3 kHz (these cases distributed across tinnitus types). Tinnitus spectra covered the region of hearing loss with no preponderance of frequencies near the audiometric edge of normal hearing."
"17101101","[Effects of noise on inner ear].","The effects of noise on health depend both on individual factors and characteristics of sound exposure. In case of acoustic trauma, reversible or irreversible lesions of inner ear components are possible. Most often there is immediately an acute tinnitus and hearing loss. Audiometric tests demonstrate hearing loss on the high frequency, generally focused on 4 kHz. Immediate treatment is recommended even there is no currently indicator of the ability to restore hearing. New perspectives on treatment are directed to local treatment and/or using new procedure as antioxidative treatment. Occupational and leisure are the two conditions in which chronic exposure to noise is found. Detection and prevention of noise-induced hearing loss is easier in case of industrial workers than in case of noise exposition for musicians and other sounds and stage technicians or concert managers, and of course non-professional with exposure to amplified music."
"17086083","Audiogram notches in noise-exposed workers.","OBJECTIVES: Diagnostic criteria for noise-induced hearing loss include the audiometric notch, yet no standardized definition exists. This study tested whether objective notch metrics could match the clinical judgments of an expert panel.DESIGN: A panel of occupational physicians, otolaryngologists, and audiologists reviewed audiograms of noise-exposed workers. In a two-sample process, the panel judged whether a notch was present and whether hearing loss had progressed in a notch pattern. Quantitative notch metrics were compared against expert decisions.RESULTS: At least five of six experts agreed about notch identification in 71 and 72% of the cases in the two samples, and agreement about notch progression was 61 and 67%. Notch depth and professional specialty appeared to affect notch judgments. Despite this variability, a notch metric showed excellent agreement with expert notch consensus in each sample (94.7 and 96.6%; kappa = 0.88 and 0.92).CONCLUSIONS: Audiogram notch metrics can agree with expert clinical consensus and assist in the surveillance of noise-exposed workers."
"17085919","A study on compliance to hearing conservation programme among industries in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia.","Noise is one of the hazards faced by workers. A cross-sectional study was conducted among industries in Negeri Sembilan with the objective to assess their compliance to Hearing Conservation Programme (HCP). The other objectives of this study were to determine the factors influencing it and to show the industries' compliance to each element of the programme. It was also to identify the association between compliance to HCP and the prevalence of hearing impairment and standard threshold shift. Data for this study were collected using questionnaires sent by mail and also the results of the latest audiometric tests. A total of 167 industries were analysed for this study. It was found that 41.3% of these industries fully complied to the programme. It was also found that the industries preferred to provide hearing protection device (92.8%) and least complied to noise control (61.1%). There were significant associations (p&lt;0.05) between compliance and number of employees, status of ownership and the presence of officer in charge of hearing conservation programme. Having at least 150 employees actually raised the compliance to HCP in two folds (beta = 0.717, OR = 2.048, C.I 95% = 1.063 to 3.944). The prevalences of hearing impairment and standard threshold shift were 23.9% and 5.2% respectively. There was no significant association between the prevalence for hearing impairment and compliance to HCP. The prevalence for standard threshold shift was inversely related to compliance. This study showed that compliance percentage need to be improved as an effort to prevent the hearing problems among workers exposed to noise."
"17050312","Assessment of central auditory processing in a group of workers exposed to solvents.","CONCLUSION: Despite having normal hearing thresholds and speech recognition thresholds, results for central auditory tests were abnormal in a group of workers exposed to solvents. Workers exposed to solvents may have difficulties in everyday listening situations that are not related to a decrement in hearing thresholds. A central auditory processing disorder may underlie these difficulties.OBJECTIVE: To study central auditory processing abilities in a group of workers occupationally exposed to a mix of organic solvents.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten workers exposed to a mix of organic solvents and 10 matched non-exposed workers were studied. The test battery comprised pure-tone audiometry, tympanometry, acoustic reflex measurement, acoustic reflex decay, dichotic digit, pitch pattern sequence, masking level difference, filtered speech, random gap detection and hearing-in-noise tests.RESULTS: All the workers presented normal hearing thresholds and no signs of middle ear abnormalities. Workers exposed to solvents had lower results in comparison with the control group and previously reported normative data, in the majority of the tests."
"17009596","Association of hsp70 polymorphisms with risk of noise-induced hearing loss in Chinese automobile workers.","Severe noise exposure can induce heat shock proteins (Hsps), and exposure to moderate noise has been reported to confer protection against noise-induced damage to hearing. Whether there is any association of genetic variation in both constitutive and inducible hsp70 genes with noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is presently unknown. Using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism, we genotyped 3 polymorphisms (+190A/ B, +1267A/B, and +2437A/B) in the hsp70-1 (rs1043618), hsp70-2 (rs1061581), and hsp70-hom (rs2227956) genes, respectively, and investigated the associations of these polymorphisms with risk of developing NIHL in 194 automobile workers working in a similar noise environment as evaluated by audiological assessment. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the associations with the risk genotypes, and Whap software was used to analyze their haplotypes. Our results showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the genotype and allele distributions of hsp70-1, hsp70-2, and hsp70-hom between the NIHL group and the normal group (P &gt; 0.05) with and without adjustment for age, sex, smoking, history of explosive noise exposure, and cumulative noise exposure. However, haplotype analysis revealed that the Hap5 (ie, haplotype +190A/+1267B/+2437A) and Hap6 (ie, haplotype +190A/+1267B/+2437B) were significantly more frequent in the NIHL group than in the normal group (20/9, P = 0.022, and 7/0, P = 0.005, respectively). Compared with Hap1 (ie, +190A/+1267A/+2437A), Hap5 was associated with a nearly 3-fold increased risk of NIHL (adjusted odds ratio, 2.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-6.27). Seven of the NIHL patients had Hap6, but none of the controls had this haplotype. Our results suggest that some haplotypes of the hsp70 genes may be associated with a higher susceptibility to NIHL."
"16962270","Course of hearing loss and occurrence of tinnitus.","Chronic tinnitus is often accompanied by a hearing impairment, but it is still unknown whether hearing loss can actually cause tinnitus. The association between the pitch of the tinnitus sensation and the audiogram edge in patients with high-frequency hearing loss suggests a functional relation, but a large fraction of patients with hearing loss does not present symptoms of tinnitus. We therefore, investigated how the occurrence of tinnitus is related to the shape of the audiogram. We analyzed a sample where all patients had noise-induced hearing loss, containing 30 patients without tinnitus, 24 patients with tone-like tinnitus, and 17 patients with noise-like tinnitus. All patients had moderate to severe high-frequency hearing loss, and only minor to moderate hearing loss at low frequencies. We found that tinnitus patients had less overall hearing loss than patients without tinnitus. Moreover, the maximum steepness of the audiogram was higher in patients with tinnitus (-52.9+/-1.9 dB/octave) compared to patients without tinnitus (-43.1+/-2.4 dB/octave). Differences in overall hearing loss and maximum steepness between tone-like and noise-like tinnitus were not significant. For tone-like tinnitus, there was a clear association between the tinnitus pitch and the edge of the audiogram, with tinnitus pitch being on average 1.48+/-0.12 octaves above the audiogram edge frequency, and 0.81+/-0.1 octaves above the frequency with the steepest slope. Our results suggest that the occurrence of tinnitus is promoted by a steep audiogram slope. A steep slope leads to abrupt discontinuities in the activity along the tonotopic axis of the auditory system, which could be misinterpreted as sound."
"16959884","Progestin negatively affects hearing in aged women.","Female hormone influences on auditory system aging are not completely understood. Because of widespread clinical use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), it is critical to understand HRT effects on sensory systems. The present study retrospectively analyzed and compared hearing abilities among 124 postmenopausal women taking HRT, treated with estrogen and progestin (E+P; n = 32), estrogen alone (E; n = 30), and a third [non-hormone replacement therapy (NHRT; n = 62)] control group. Subjects were 60-86 years old and were matched for age and health status. All had relatively healthy medical histories and no significant noise exposure, middle-ear problems, or major surgeries. Hearing tests included pure-tone audiometry, tympanometry, distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), transient otoacoustic emissions, and the hearing-in-noise test (HINT). The HINT tests for speech perception in background noise, the major complaint of hearing-impaired persons. Pure-tone thresholds in both ears were elevated (poorer) for the E+P relative to the E and control groups. For DPOAEs, the E+P group presented with lower (worse) levels than the E and control groups, with significant differences for both ears. For the HINT results, the E+P group had poorer speech perception than the E and control groups across all background noise speaker locations and in quiet. These findings suggest that the presence of P as a component of HRT results in poorer hearing abilities in aged women taking HRT, affecting both the peripheral (ear) and central (brain) auditory systems, and it interferes with the perception of speech in background noise."
"16957502","Methodological issues when comparing hearing thresholds of a group with population standards: the case of the ferry engineers.","OBJECTIVES: To discuss appropriate and inappropriate methods for comparing distributions of hearing thresholds of a study group with distributions in population standards and to determine whether the thresholds of Washington State Ferries engineers are different from those of men in the general population, using both frequency-by-frequency comparisons and analysis of audiometric shape.DESIGN: The most recent hearing conservation program audiograms of 321 noise-exposed engineers, ages 35 to 64, were compared with the predictions of Annexes A, B, and C from ANSI S3.44. There was no screening by history or otoscopy; all audiograms were included. 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for the engineers' median thresholds for each ear, for the better ear (defined two ways), and for the binaural average. For Annex B, where 95% CIs are also available, it was possible to calculate z scores for the differences between Annex B and the engineers' better ears. Bulge depth, an audiometric shape statistic, measured curvature between 1 and 6 kHz.RESULTS: Engineers' better-ear median thresholds were worse than those in Annex A but (except at 1 kHz) were as good as or better than those in Annexes B and C, which are more appropriate for comparison to an unscreened noise-exposed group like the engineers. Average bulge depth for the engineers was similar to that of the Annex B standard (no added occupational noise) and was much less than that of audiograms created by using the standard with added occupational noise between 90 and 100 dBA.CONCLUSIONS: Audiograms from groups that have been selected for a particular exposure, but, without regard to severity, can appropriately be compared with population standards, if certain pitfalls are avoided. For unscreened study groups with large age-sex subgroups, a simple method to assess statistical significance, taking into consideration uncertainties in both the study group and the comparison standard, is the calculation of z scores for the proportion of better-ear thresholds above the Annex B median. A less powerful method combines small age-sex subgroups after age correction. Small threshold differences, even if statistically significant, may not be due to genuine differences in hearing sensitivity between study group and standard. Audiometric shape analysis offers an independent dimension of comparison between the study group and audiograms predicted from the ANSI S3.44 standard, with and without occupational noise exposure. Important pitfalls in comparison to population standards include nonrandom selection of study groups, inappropriate choice of population standard, use of the right and left ear thresholds instead of the better-ear threshold for comparison to Annex B, and comparing means with medians. The thresholds of the engineers in this study were similar to published standards for an unscreened population."
"16903348","[Evaluation of the risk on hearing loss at soldiers].","INTRODUCTION: Noise produced by weapons may be harmful to soldiers during military service. Exposure to impulse noise during compulsory military service depends on the number of shots, explosion impulses, distance of injured ear from causal firearm as well as on the use of hearing protectors. Weapons produce impulse noises, which are characterized by peak pressure level and frequency. The purpose of this work was to calculate and estimate risk on hearing at soldiers during one year of the military service.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comparised three groups of soldiers with different kind of exposure to noise divided according total noise exposure. In order to evaluate the amount of the exposure to impulse noise the total level of noise and the spectrum analysis were performed for all types of weapons, which were used during military service. The equivalent continuous A-weighted sound pressure level, L A eq, Te [dB], maximum A-weighted sound pressure level, L A max [dB] and C weighted peak sound pressure level, L C peak [dB] were measured.RESULTS: The highest total exposure to noise concerned group I (2222,9 kPa(2)/s for right ear and 22212,8 kPa(2)/s for left one) with total exposure time 248,3 minutes. In the II group estimated total exposure to noise was 611,8 kPa(2)/s for right ear and 743,6 kPa(2)/s for left one. In the III group least exposed to noise, estimated total exposure to noise was 103 kPa(2)/s for right ear and 109 kPa(2)/s for left one with total time exposure 17,8 minutes.CONCLUSIONS: Difference between groups is dependent on kind of military service. Estimated exposure to weapons noise may prevent soldiers before hearing loss. We did not notice differences between sites of ears."
"16903347","[Distortion product otoacoustic emissions before and after one year exposure to impulse noise].","INTRODUCTION: Firearms are a common source of impulse noise that may be very harmful to the auditory organ. Impulse noise from weapons and explosions continually produces hearing damage among military personnel. The discovery of otoacoustic emission (OAE) has given a new possibility of early diagnosis of noise induced hearing loss. The transiently evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) are non-invasive, objective and frequency specific audiometric tests for evaluating outer hair cell function. The aim of the study was to asses the effects of exposure to impulse noise on DPOAE after one year of the obligatory military service.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprised 92 (184 ears) soldiers, subjected to impulse noise during military service. The examine group was divided according total noise exposure. The control group consisted of secondary school students not exposed to noise. DPOAE was recorded before and after one year of military service.RESULTS: After military service significant deterioration of DPOAE level was observed at frequencies of 1, 3, and 4 kHz on the right ear and 2, 5 and 6 kHz left one.CONCLUSIONS: 1. Reduction of DPOAE amplitude connected all frequencies. 2. We did not notice significant differences between groups connected total noise exposure."

A cross-sectional study was conducted that included sonometry tests, carried out according to the established methodology by COVENIN rules, and the occupational medical evaluation and liminal tonal audiometrics test in 75 workers. The equivalent noise levels (Leq) was quantified in different workplaces. It was found out that most of the workers are exposed to high noise levels [&gt;85 dB(A)] and during more time than the recommended. All workers use hearing protectors appropriately. The hearing loss prevalence in workers was 16.0%, there were not noise-induced hearing losses. The hearing threshold registered in the audiometrics test was diminished, but inside the normal threshold values. We diagnosed 12 cases of conductive hearing loss, all grade I; there were not sensorial or mixed hearing losses. There was not a relationship between the equivalent noise level and hearing loss. It is suggested the design and implantation of a program of auditory conservation to protect the health and security of the workers and to conduct a longitudinal study considering the findings of the present study as it basis."

We recruited 58 workers at an adhesive materials manufacturing plant who were exposured to both toluene and noise [78.6-87.1 A-weighted decibels; dB(A)], 58 workers exposed to noise only [83.5-90.1 dB(A)], and 58 administrative clerks [67.9-72.6 dB(A)] at the same company. We interviewed participants to obtain sociodemographic and employment information and performed physical examinations, including pure-tone audiometry tests between 0.5 and 6 kHz. A contracted laboratory certified by the Council of Labor in Taiwan conducted on-site toluene and noise exposure measurements. The prevalence of hearing loss of &gt;or=25 dB in the toluene plus noise group (86.2%) was much greater than that in the noise-only group (44.8%) and the administrative clerks (5.0%) (p&lt;0.001). The prevalence rates were 67.2, 32.8, and 8.3% (p&lt;0.001), respectively, when 0.5 kHz was excluded from the estimation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the toluene plus noise group had an estimated risk for hearing loss&gt;or=25 dB, 10.9 times higher than that of the noise-only group. The risk ratio dropped to 5.8 when 0.5 kHz was excluded from the risk estimation. Hearing impairment was greater for the pure-tone frequency of 1 kHz than for that of 2 kHz. However, the mean hearing threshold was the poorest for 6 kHz, and the least effect was observed for 2 kHz. Our results suggest that toluene exacerbates hearing loss in a noisy environment, with the main impact on the lower frequencies."
"16875225","Low-level otoacoustic emissions may predict susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss.","In a longitudinal study with 338 volunteers, audiometric thresholds and otoacoustic emissions were measured before and after 6 months of noise exposure on an aircraft carrier. While the average amplitudes of the otoacoustic emissions decreased significantly, the average audiometric thresholds did not change. Furthermore, there were no significant correlations between changes in audiometric thresholds and changes in otoacoustic emissions. Changes in transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions were moderately correlated. Eighteen ears acquired permanent audiometric threshold shifts. Only one-third of those ears showed significant otoacoustic emission shifts that mirrored their permanent threshold shifts. A Bayesian analysis indicated that permanent threshold shift status following a deployment was predicted by baseline low-level or absent otoacoustic emissions. The best predictor was transient-evoked otoacoustic emission amplitude in the 4-kHz half-octave frequency band, with risk increasing more than sixfold from approximately 3% to 20% as the emission amplitude decreased. It is possible that the otoacoustic emissions indicated noise-induced changes in the inner ear, undetected by audiometric tests. Otoacoustic emissions may therefore be a diagnostic predictor for noise-induced-hearing-loss risk."
"16850905","Hypertension and hearing impairment in workers of iron and steel industry.","The objectives of the present study were to study the (i) prevalence of hypertension and hearing impairment in iron and steel industry workers, (ii) association between hypertension and hearing impairment, (iii) association between hypertension and hearing impairment, with duration of exposure, and (iv) correlation between levels of sound and noise induced health problems viz. hypertension and hearing impairment in a cross sectional study involving Workers working in iron and steel industry at Nagpur. Of a total of 804 workers, 770 workers participated in the study. There were five sections in the factory; Steel melting section (SMS), rolling mill section (RMS), quality control department (QCD), maintenance department (MD) and administration department (AD). Workers working in SMS, RMS, &amp; QCD formed a continuously exposed group (CEG); workers of MD and AD formed intermittently exposed group (IEG). Workers were interviewed, examined and information was collected in a pre-tested pro-forma. Blood pressure was measured, and tuning fork tests were done to assess hearing ability. Prevalence of hypertension among CEG (25.51%) was significantly higher than IEG (14.05%). (X2-14.28, df-1, P&lt;0.001). There was positive association between duration of exposure and prevalence of hypertension. The prevalence of hearing impairment was significantly more in CEG (20.5%) as compared to IEG (8.91%). (X2-11.69, df-1, P&lt;0.001). Occurrence of hearing impairment was also directly proportional to the duration of exposure. The correlation between level of sound exposure and hearing impairment was found to be significant (r=0.98; P&lt;0.05), the correlation between level of sound and hypertension was found to be statistically insignificant (r=0.84; P&gt;0.05). The results of the present study indicate that hypertension and hearing impairment are commoner in workers continuously exposed to high levels of occupational noise."
"16825883","Hearing in nonprofessional pop/rock musicians.","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hearing and subjective auditory symptoms in a group of nonprofessional pop/rock musicians who had experienced repeated exposures to intense sound levels during at least 5 yr of musical activity.DESIGN: An evaluation of both ears in 42 nonprofessional pop/rock musicians included pure-tone audiometry in the conventional and extended high-frequency range, the measurement of uncomfortable loudness levels, and an assessment of tinnitus and hypersensitivity to sound. Exclusion criteria were (a) the occurrence of acoustic trauma, (b) excessive noise exposure during occupational activities, (c) a history of recurrent otitis media, (d) previous ear surgery, (e) a fracture of the cranium, (f) ingestion of potentially ototoxic drugs, and (g) reported hearing difficulties within the immediate family. These audiometric results were then compared with a control group of 20 otologically normal young adults with no history of long-term noise exposure.RESULTS: After adjusting for age and gender, relative to ISO 7029, the mean hearing threshold in the frequency range of 3 to 8 kHz was 6 dB in the musicians and 1.5 dB in the control group. This difference was statistically significant (Mann-Whitney rank sum test, p &lt; 0.001). A significant difference was also observed between musicians using regular hearing protection during their activities (average 3 to 8 kHz thresholds = 2.4 dB) and musicians who never used such hearing protection (average 3 to 8 kHz thresholds = 8.2 dB), after adjusting for age and gender (Mann-Whitney rank sum test, p = 0.006). Eleven of the musicians (26%) were found to be hypersensitive to sound, and seven (17%) presented with tinnitus. Tinnitus assessment, however, did not reveal any clinically significant psychological distress in these individuals.CONCLUSIONS: Tinnitus and hypersensitivity to sound were observed in a significant minority within a group of nonprofessional pop/rock musicians who had experienced repeated exposure to intense sound levels over at least 5 yr but with minimal impact on their lives. Moreover, hearing loss was minimal in the subjects who always used ear protection, being only 0.9 dB higher than the control group. In contrast, hearing loss was significantly more pronounced, at 6.7 dB higher than the control group, in those musicians who never used ear protection. Continued education about the risk to hearing and the benefits of the persistent use of ear protection is warranted for musicians who are exposed frequently to intense sound levels."
"16782739","Variability of real-world hearing protector attenuation measurements.","The attenuation provided by a hearing protection device (HPD) in the field is usually estimated by applying a derating factor to the laboratory-determined noise reduction rating (NRR) of the HPD. However, attenuation is highly dependent on individual-specific HPD fit. Prediction of an individual's attenuation depends on the accuracy of the measurement system and the variability of attenuation over time (e.g. after HPD refitting). Variability in attenuation and attenuation test systems has not been adequately characterized to allow for such an assessment. This study compared attenuation measurements made with two systems, Real-Ear-at-Threshold (REAT) and Microphone-in-Real-Ear (MIRE), on 20 workers using two earplugs (foam and custom-molded). Workers' perceptions of the earplugs were also evaluated. Individuals' attenuation results were summarized as personal attenuation ratings (PARs, similar to NRRs). Variability in PARs from between-subject, within-subject and within-day (i.e. repeated tests on a subject without earplug refitting) differences was assessed and used to present the lower confidence limit, or uncertainty factor (UF), of an average individual's attenuation. The custom-molded earplug PARs achieved a higher mean percentage of labeled attenuation than did the foam earplug with both test systems. The custom-molded earplugs also had higher overall acceptance among workers. MIRE PAR levels were lower than REAT levels for both earplugs, but the relationship between the two test systems was highly variable. The MIRE system had lower within-day variability than the REAT system. One individual's MIRE results were highly influential; removal of these results greatly reduced the UF for the custom-molded earplug/MIRE combination. UFs ranged from 8.8 to 13.5 dB. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating variability in individual-specific protection results for personal protective equipment like HPDs, rather than relying on single measurements."
"16761701","Efficacy of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in protecting ears exposed to loud music.","Antioxidants have been reported to be effective in reducing acoustic trauma in animal models but have not been studied in humans. In this study, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was evaluated to determine if it would reduce temporary changes in auditory function as a result of exposure to loud music in humans. Pure-tone thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were collected in 31 normal-hearing participants, using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, before and after two hours of live music in a nightclub. Using repeated measures analysis of variance, no statistically significant differences were found between participants who received NAC versus a placebo for any of the outcome measures. Across all subjects, the largest pure-tone threshold shift occurred at 4 kHz. DPOAE measures were characterized by reductions in amplitude and a trend for shorter group delay values. When the 3 and 4 kHz data were examined by imposing specific criteria of greater than 2 dB DPOAE amplitude reductions and 10 dB or greater pure-tone threshold shifts, DPOAE reductions occurred more often at 3 kHz, and pure-tone shifts occurred more often at 4 kHz."
"16757506","Predictive validity of a retrospective measure of noise exposure.","AIMS: To investigate the validity of measures of noise exposure derived retrospectively for a cohort of nuclear energy workers for the period 1950-98, by investigating their ability to predict hearing loss.METHODS: Subjects were men aged 45-65 chosen from a larger group of employees--assembled for a nested case-control study of noise and death from ischaemic heart disease--who had had at least one audiogram after at least five years' work. Average hearing loss, across both ears and the frequencies 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz, was calculated from the last audiogram for each man. Previous noise exposure at work was assessed retrospectively by three hygienists using work histories, noise survey records from 1965-98, and judgement about use of hearing protection devices. Smoking and age at the time of the audiogram were extracted from records. Differences in hearing loss between men categorised by cumulative noise exposure were assessed after controlling for age, smoking, year of test, and previous test experience.RESULTS: There were 186 and 150 eligible subjects at sites A and B of the company respectively who were employed for an average of 20 years. Compared to men with less than one year's exposure to levels of 85dB(A) or greater, hearing loss was greater by 3.7 dB (90% CI -2.6 to 10.1), 3.8 dB (90% CI -2.6 to 10.3), 7.0 dB (90% CI 1.1 to 12.9) and 10.1 dB (90% CI 4.2 to 16.0) in the lowest to highest categories of cumulative noise exposure at site B. In contrast, at site A, the corresponding figures were -2.2 dB, -2.4 dB, -1.8 dB, and -4.4 dB, with no confidence interval excluding zero.CONCLUSIONS: Noise estimation at one site was shown to have predictive validity in terms of hearing loss, but not at the other site. Reasons for the differences between sites are discussed."

"16735910","Otoacoustic emissions and persistent tinnitus after acute acoustic trauma.","OBJECTIVES: To follow up the auditory status of military personnel after an acute acoustic trauma and to identify the possible predictive value of hearing thresholds and otoacoustic emissions during the first 24 hours after the acoustic trauma.STUDY DESIGN: A group of 24 young military subjects, aged 22 +/- 2.3 years, without any otologic problem before the acoustic trauma, were examined at three time intervals after an accidental acoustic trauma caused by the discharge of a firearm: 24 hours, 72 hours, and 15 days.METHODS: Each subject was submitted to medical examination and to a questionnaire detailing the circumstances of the acoustic trauma. Pure tone audiometry was performed from 1 to 8 kHz per half octave. Transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions were recorded in the nonlinear mode at 80 dB pSPL, and distortion product otoacoustic emissions were recorded from 1 to 6 kHz, using a distortion product-gram type procedure, at 65/55 dB SPL, with f2/f1 = 1.22. Two groups of subjects were defined: group 1 (n = 8) represented subjects with short-lasting tinnitus (&lt;72 h) and group 2 (n = 16) subjects with long-lasting tinnitus (&gt;72 h).RESULTS: Hearing thresholds did not differ significantly between these two groups 24 hours after the acoustic trauma. However, otoacoustic emissions showed significantly lower amplitudes 24 hours after the acoustic trauma in subjects showing a longer lasting tinnitus.CONCLUSION: Otoacoustic emissions appear to be a better predictor of the persistence of tinnitus than hearing thresholds alone 24 hours after an acute acoustic trauma."
"16717022","Hearing loss induced by occupational and impulse noise: results on threshold shifts by frequencies, age and gender from the Nord-Trndelag Hearing Loss Study.","The aim of the study was to compare the frequency-specific effects of noise on hearing acuity across the range 250-8000 Hz and the extent to which the patterns of frequency-specific threshold shifts differ between occupational noise and impulse noise. Pure-tone audiometry was administered to an adult general population sample with 51 975 subjects who also provided questionnaire information about noise exposure and other risk factors. Threshold shifts induced by life-long occupational noise and impulse noise (mostly shooting) were estimated separately in six age and sex groups for eight frequencies. Reported noise exposure, as well as observed threshold shifts, were moderate among women. Threshold shifts averaged over both ears among subjects in the higher 2% of exposure to occupational noise, reached 13 dB (3000 Hz, age 65 years + ) among men and were generally largest at 3000-4000 Hz. The shifts induced by impulse noise reached approximately 8 dB among men 45-64 years and men 65 years+. The effects of impulse noise were strongest at 3000-8000 Hz and varied little within this frequency range."

"16704911","Occupational exposure to noise, and hearing function among electro production workers.","OBJECTIVE: The present study has the aim to investigate the prevalence and the determinants of hearing loss among electro production workers.METHODS: Ninety-three electro production workers and 51 office workers underwent audiometric test. Information regarding, socio-demographics, present and past medical history of hearing problems, use of ototoxic drugs, hobbies, and smoking habit was obtained using a self administered questionnaire.RESULTS: The levels of noise at workplace have also been measured. Electro production workers were exposed to high levels of noise. Statistical analysis has shown that 44% of electro production workers had sensorineural hearing loss located mainly at 4000 Hz. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that occupational exposure to noise appears to be the strongest predictor (odds ratio, OR: 7.51) of NIHL followed by aging (OR: 5.34), and last by smoking (OR: 2.47).CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that electro production workers are occupationally exposed to high levels of noise, and present high rates of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The observed hearing loss was located mainly at 4000 Hz. These findings underline the need for interventions to reduce the risk for the development of NIHL among electro production workers."
"16702119","Hearing loss in migrant agricultural workers.","BACKGROUND: Farmers have high rates of hearing loss, yet little is known about the hearing status of migrant agricultural workers. We performed a cross-sectional survey to assess the prevalence and impact of hearing loss in this population.METHODS: One hundred fifty migrant and seasonal agricultural workers were surveyed at a series of health fairs held at migrant camps. A bilingual questionnaire included items related to hearing loss risk factors and subjective hearing difficulties. Pure tone audiometry and tympanometry were performed in a mobile testing van.RESULTS: More than half the subjects had some degree of hearing loss at audiometric frequencies between 500 and 6,000 Hz, especially in the higher frequencies. Hispanic males in the sample had significantly greater prevalence of high-frequency hearing loss compared to adults in the national Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES). More than 35% of respondents complained of subjective difficulty hearing or understanding speech, yet no workers reported use of hearing aids. Even after adjusting for measured hearing loss, Hispanic farm workers were more likely than their English- speaking counterparts to complain of difficulty hearing or understanding speech, suggesting that language barriers could worsen the impact of hearing loss. Risk factors for hearing loss included age and abnormal tympanometry. Occupational exposures to noise from tractors and other machinery as well as pesticides were frequently reported, while use of hearing protection was rare.CONCLUSION: Hearing loss is a significant and under-recognized problem in the migrant worker population. Further preventive and treatment efforts are warranted."
"16684706","A study of hearing changes among military conscripts in the Swedish Army.","The aim of the study was to investigate the incidence and the relative risk of significant threshold shift (STS, &gt;or=15 dB deterioration at any ear and audiometric frequency) during primary military service (7-9 months), and to investigate whether subjects with an initial slight hearing loss (thresholds&gt;or=25 dB HL at any audiometric frequency and ear) were under increased risk. The investigation was made as a prospective audiometric study and included 747 men. An age-matched group of 138 individuals served as an unexposed control group, whose incidence of STS was 2.9%. In the exposed group the incidence was 7.9% and the relative risk 2.7 risk ratio (RR). In the subgroup of 95 persons, who already at reporting-for-training had a mild hearing loss, the incidence was 17%. The relative risk for STS in this group compared to the control group was 6.8 (RR), and compared to those with normal hearing at reporting was 3.1 (RR). In spite of hearing conservation efforts, hearing deterioration still occurs, above all in the artillery. Those who already at reporting-for-training had a mild hearing loss were at higher risk for STS compared to those with initially normal hearing."
"16680467","Occupational noise exposure and sensorineural hearing loss among workers of a steel rolling mill.","Hearing loss is one of the most common chronic health conditions and has important implications for the patient's quality of life. However, hearing loss is substantially underestimated and under treated. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of sensorineural hearing loss among the workers in a steel rolling mill in Nigeria. Each of the 150 randomly selected subjects had a structured questionnaire administered to them, followed by a full otological examination. Of these, 116 had tympanometry and pure-tone audiometry. Also a noise mapping of their respective work units was done. The workers were exposed to noise levels varying from 49 to 93 dBA. About 28.2% of the 103 who had their audiogram analysed had mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss in their better ear and 56.8% of them had mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss in their worse ear. The pure-tone average and the average hearing thresholds at 4 kHz for the groups significantly increased with an increasing noise exposure level. The prevalence of sensorineural hearing loss among the study population is high; and noise exposure is at least contributory. Pre-employment and regular audiometry while on the job is highly recommended."
"16583105","[Program for hearing loss prevention in four metallurgical factories in Piracicaba, So Paulo, Brazil].","This study analyzes noise control programs in four metallurgical factories in Piracicaba, So Paulo, Brazil. From 1997 to 2001, 741 workers were examined and the programs were analyzed based on workers' profiles (2,270 audiometric exams) and documents on hearing preservation programs. 41% of workers presented hearing loss (mean age 42.3; mean years of work 16.7). 104 workers with more than one audiometric exam presented changes in hearing threshold. 36.5% (38 workers) developed noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and 63.5% (66 workers) with existing NIHL showed worsening of their hearing threshold. In these factories, 69.5% of workers were exposed to &gt; or = 84dB(A). We concluded that the hearing preservation programs are not adequately organized and that workers are still exposed to high noise levels at work, posing a risk for NIHL. In addition, the current legislation on hearing loss prevention is not enforced."
"16578979","A comparison of the military entrance processing station screening audiogram with the Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System reference audiogram at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, in 2000.","BACKGROUND: The Department of Defense Hearing Conservation Program requires that a reference audiogram be performed at initial entry training (IET), before noise exposure. In the Army, only Fort Sill, home of the field artillery, and Fort Benning, home of the infantry, are in compliance. All military applicants receive a screening audiogram at a military entrance processing station (MEPS) to qualify for service. This audiogram does not meet the Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System-Hearing Conservation (DOEHRS-HC) standard. Nevertheless, it has been proposed that the MEPS screen be used as the reference because of limited resources and time during IET medical in-processing.METHODS: A total of 11,816 individual reference audiograms performed at Fort Sill 95th Adjutant General Recruit Reception Center in 2000 were identified in the DOEHRS-HC database. Results of the MEPS screening audiograms were found for 11,311 (96%) of these individuals. The two audiograms were compared by frequency and ear and by using the two Department of Defense criteria for threshold shift.RESULTS: A total of 14.49% (95% confidence interval, 14.48-14.50%) of audiograms using the three-frequency average difference and 23.19% (95% confidence interval, 23.18-23.20%) using the four-frequency difference in either ear demonstrated a threshold shift. The mean difference in intensity between the two audiograms ranged from 5 to 12 dB and varied by frequency and ear, with the greatest differences being seen at 500 and 6,000 kHz and in the left ear, compared with the right ear. The mean threshold level was higher for each frequency in the DOEHRS-HC audiogram, compared with the MEPS audiogram.CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 15% of soldiers at Fort Sill in 2000 showed a clinically significant threshold difference between their MEPS screening and the DOEHRS-HC baseline audiogram. Methodological variations in testing and interval noise-induced hearing loss could account for these differences. The results do not support the use of the MEPS screening audiogram as the reference audiogram. Compliance with the Hearing Conservation Program in the Army would require either improving MEPS testing to DOEHRS-HC standards or performing baseline audiograms at all five IET sites."

All of the conscripts underwent hearing screening. The conscripts' time in noisy activities and their rating of the loudness and estimated noise levels of the activities were used as the predictors in the risk analysis. Self-reported hearing symptoms (i.e., tinnitus, pain in the ear) and hearing loss due to noise exposure were also inquired about. Twenty-seven percent of the conscripts had weekly noise exposure to &gt; 85 dBA. Approximately 20% of the conscripts had &gt;20 dB hearing loss in either ear in the frequency range of 0.5 to 8 kHz.

"16551755","Noise exposure and hearing loss prevention programmes after 20 years of regulations in the United States.","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate noise exposures and hearing loss prevention efforts in industries with relatively high rates of workers' compensation claims for hearing loss.METHODS: Washington State workers' compensation records were used to identify up to 10 companies in each of eight industries. Each company (n = 76) was evaluated by a management interview, employee personal noise dosimetry (n = 983), and employee interviews (n = 1557).RESULTS: Full-shift average exposures were &gt; or =85 dBA for 50% of monitored employees, using Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) parameters with a 5 dB exchange rate (L(ave)), but 74% were &gt; or =85 dBA using a 3 dB exchange rate (L(eq)). Only 14% had L(ave) &gt; or =90 dBA, but 42% had L(eq) &gt; or =90 dBA. Most companies conducted noise measurements, but most kept no records, and consideration of noise controls was low in all industries. Hearing loss prevention programmes were commonly incomplete. Management interview scores (higher score = more complete programme) showed significant associations with percentage of employees having L(ave) &gt; or =85 dBA and presence of a union (multiple linear regression; R2 = 0.24). Overall, 62% of interviewed employees reported always using hearing protection when exposed. Protector use showed significant associations with percentage of employees specifically required to use protection, management score, and average employee time spent &gt; or =95 dBA (R2 = 0.65).CONCLUSIONS: The findings raise serious concerns about the adequacy of prevention, regulation, and enforcement strategies in the United States. The percentage of workers with excessive exposure was 1.5-3 times higher using a 3 dB exchange rate instead of the OSHA specified 5 dB exchange rate. Most companies gave limited or no attention to noise controls and relied primarily on hearing protection to prevent hearing loss; yet 38% of employees did not use protectors routinely. Protector use was highest when hearing loss prevention programmes were most complete, indicating that under-use of protection was, in some substantial part, attributable to incomplete or inadequate company efforts."

"16470283","[Association between noise-induced hearing loss and tinnitus].","The objective of this study was to verify an association between noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and tinnitus in workers exposed to occupational noise. Workers with a history of work noise exposure who attended two audiology outpatient clinics were interviewed and evaluated. The statistical association between NIHL and tinnitus was evaluated using an adjusted linear regression model, with tinnitus as the dependent variable and NIHL, classified into six levels, as the independent variable, with age and length of noise exposure as covariates. Data were collected from 284 workers between April and October, 2003, in Bauru, So Paulo State, Brazil. Tinnitus was observed to increase with the progression of auditory damage, controlled by age and length of noise exposure. These results suggest that investment in hearing conservation programs is needed, especially for source noise emission control and for intervention in hearing loss progression that is caused by noise exposure, in order to maintain auditory health and reduce the associated symptoms."
"16422455","Hearing in military pilots: one-time audiometry in pilots of fighters, transports, and helicopters.","INTRODUCTION: Pilots are exposed to potentially harmful levels of noise, the actual consequences of which are still poorly documented. We have determined the audiometric profiles of pilots as a function of age and type of aircraft (i.e., fighter, transport, helicopter) and have searched for risk factors of deafness other than noise in a pilot population.METHODS: We examined 521 French military pilots ages 20-40 yr during their annual medical check-ups. Pilots were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire and data from tonal audiograms of both ears were collected. Hearing levels were compared between groups of age and aircraft category.RESULTS: Abnormal hearing levels in pilots were found essentially at high frequencies with a marked notch on audiograms at 6 kHz. Left ears had a significantly poorer performance compared with right ears. At a given age, transport pilots had, on average, better hearing at 8 kHz than other pilots, despite a higher number of flying hours. In addition to the 6 kHz notch, helicopter pilots showed a significant hearing loss at 3 kHz. Such an enlargement of the impaired frequency range can disturb speech communication. Prevalence of otitis media in childhood was significantly higher in pilots with abnormal hearing.DISCUSSION: Pilots flying fighter and helicopter aircraft are at a higher risk of hearing loss compared with pilots flying transport aircraft. Improvements in ear protection seem particularly needed for the left ear. Hearing losses can potentially compromise speech communication in helicopter pilots."

The outcome variable was a hearing threshold at 4000 Hz in the left ear greater than 25 dB for annual and periodic audiograms. Personnel were characterized by gender, officer status, 5-yr age groups, and by military occupational skills (MOS) groups of &quot;aviation,&quot; &quot;combat arms,&quot; and &quot;other.&quot;RESULTS: After adjustment by logistic regression for age group, gender, and officer status, the &quot;aviation&quot; group was not different from the &quot;other&quot; category, while the &quot;combat arms&quot; group was more likely to have elevated hearing thresholds. Officers and women demonstrated significantly lower rates for elevated thresholds.DISCUSSION: These findings provide information for personnel planning and assessing military hearing conservation programs."
"16418922","Influence of environmental factors on the evolution of industrial noise-induced hearing loss.","The aim of the study is to investigate how environmental factors, associated with exposure to industrial noise, affect the development of chronic noise-induced hearing loss. The study was conducted on 186 male subjects working in two bottling plants, situated respectively in a small farming community, and in a medium-sized city with significant levels of noise pollution. Levels of occupational exposure were the same for the two groups. The subjects were selected by means of a preliminary medical examination, and exposed to tonal hearing tests and acoustic impedance tests. Statistical analysis was performed on hearing threshold values obtained at the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz. The comparison between the thresholds obtained in the two groups showed a statistically significant difference, especially at the frequency of 4000 Hz and for occupational exposure exceeding 17 yr. The results led us to conclude that environmental factors, and urban noise in particular, influence the onset and development of occupational acoustic trauma, and that those working in the country are significantly less affected than those in the city. Since occupational exposure was the same for both groups, their different responses must therefore be interpreted as due to differences in non-occupational exposure, in turn dependent on different opportunities for rest from noise and different levels of exposure to noise pollution."
"19292087","[Specific effects upon hearing due to occupational noise].","Every day, millions of employees are exposed to noise at work and at the risks this can entail. While the noise is most obviously in industries such as manufacturing and construction, it can also be an issue in a wide range of other working environments. One in five workers have to raise their voice to be heard for at least half of the time when they are at work. This paper shortly presents the physical aspects of the noise and its dangerous local level effects on the human body."
"18163089","[Characteristics of a negative effect of aviation noise on hearing organ of aircraft maintenance personnel].","Otolaryngological examination was carried out of 80 engineers and technicians engaged in maintenance of aircrafts in the airports. They are continuously exposed to occupational aviation noise and therefore are at risk for chronic neurosensory hypoacusis. Pure tone audiogram registers in them a rise in hearing thresholds throughout the whole band of frequencies studied. This means that aviation maintenance staff is exposed to noise containing highly intensive infrasound and high-frequency components. The detected pathology directly correlated with duration of exposure to noise. Development of neurosensory hypoacusis in aviation maintenance specialists starts earlier than in other specialists exposed to noise."

"18043427","Reliability of microdrill stapedotomy: comparison with pick stapedotomy.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the hearing outcomes and complications of the microdrill and pick stapedotomy techniques.PATIENTS: We assessed 123 primary otosclerosis operation in 103 patients who had more than 1 year follow-up (71 microdrill; 52 pick stapedotomies). There were 87 women and 36 men in the study group (mean age, 44 +/- 11.2 years) at surgery.INTERVENTION: Stapedotomy for otosclerosis.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pure tone hearing thresholds and clinical evaluation for complications.RESULTS: In the microdrill group, preoperative mean air conduction was 61 dB, and mean bone conduction was 27 dB, postoperatively, these values improved to 31 dB and 16 dB, respectively. In the pick group, mean air conduction was 61 dB, and mean bone conduction was 27 dB, which improved postoperatively to 33 dB and 18 dB, respectively. Postoperative hearing gains were similar in both groups (p &gt; 0.005). The mean postoperative gain in bone conduction was significant (p &lt; 0.001) in each group: 11 dB in the microdrill group and 9 dB in the pick group, with no significant difference between the two groups. The preoperative air-bone gap was 34 dB in both groups, and improved to 15 dB in both. Complication rates were similar.CONCLUSION: The microdrill and pick stapedotomy techniques produced similar hearing results and complication rates. Within the limitations of the present study, we found no evidence of microdrill-induced acoustic trauma. The microdrill can be a useful technique in performing a stapedotomy and seems to produce similar results to those associated with pick stapedotomy."
"18034257","Is the audiologic status of professional musicians a reflection of the noise exposure in classical orchestral music?","The sound in classical orchestral music is louder than noise emissions allowed by national rules in industry. We wanted to assess the audiologic status of professional musicians at different ages of their careers and to look for a coherence of declined hearing ability and the sound emissions in order to substantiate advices for hearing protection and occupational medicine in musicians. Data from questionnaires (anamnestic data on sound exposure in profession and leisure times, use of hearing protection, self-evaluation of hearing function and hearing deficits), audiometric data and amplitudes of OAE were evaluated from 109 professional musicians aged 30-69 years from three major German orchestras and from 110 students of an academy of music (aged 11-19 years). Sound emissions of the whole orchestra and of single instruments/instrument groups were measured at the orchestra stages and pits during rehearsals and performances. None of the musicians was engaged in noisy hobbies and only a few used hearing protectors regularly. More than 50% of the musicians had a hearing loss of 15 dB(A) and more. Highest losses were found among the strings and the brass players. DPOAE amplitudes coincidently declined with the duration of performing music in the orchestras. Professional musicians aged older than 60 years had a significantly greater hearing loss at 4 and 6 kHz than those aged 30-39 years. Among the strings in one orchestra a dominant hearing deficit in the left ears was observed. Musicians need the same health care for their hearing as workers in noisy industry. A better education on the hearing hazards (use of hearing protectors) as well as sound protection in the rehearsal rooms is necessary. Hearing loss in professional musicians should be accepted as an occupational disease."
"18025758","Hearing impairment among mill workers in small scale enterprises in southwest Nigeria.","This cross-sectional study was conducted among mill workers in a large market in Ibadan, southwest Nigeria. These workers are engaged in small scale businesses with little or no regulation of work exposures. Questionnaires administered to mill workers sought information on personal characteristics, length of time engaged in the job, type of milling done and symptoms of hearing impairment. Noise exposure and hearing impairment were assessed among 85 mill workers. Audiometry was done on mill workers and 45 controls with no known exposure to noise and no history of aural disease. Noise levels at work stations ranged from 88-90dB for small mills and 101-105 for larger mills. None of the workers used hearing protection. Analysis based on total number of ears showed that 56% of the workers had hearing impairment ranging from mild (49%) moderate (6.4%) to severe (0.6%) whilst 33% of the controls had hearing impairment which was mild (26%), moderate (7%) and no severe losses, P = 0.001. There was no association between age and hearing impairment but prevalence of hearing impairment was highest among those who had been engaged in the trade for more than 20 years. There is a need for regulation of small scale enterprises to protect the health of workers. Health education and provision of low cost ear plugs will reduce the occurrence and severity of hearing impairment among these low income workers."
"17999904","[Acoustic trauma in classical music players].","OBJECTIVE: To confirm the existence of acoustic trauma in classical musicians.MATERIAL AND METHOD: Sixty-five volunteers from the Castilla and Len Symphony Orchestra were studied. The hearing thresholds of each musician were age-corrected using the ELI and ISO 7029:2000 scales. Furthermore the sound levels of the instruments in this symphony orchestra were studied.RESULTS: We observed that the sound level of the symphony orchestra instruments is higher than the level permitted by law, ie it constitutes a risk for hearing loss. We also found that 4 kHz hearing loss in the 5th percentile among musicians was double the rate that would be expected for age, and that violinists and viola players showed poorer hearing in the left ear.CONCLUSIONS: Classical music causes acoustic trauma in musicians and should be recognized as a professional illness. Musicians are obliged to protect their hearing and to undergo regular check-ups."
"17977289","An assessment of the effect of sound produced in a dental clinic on the hearing of dentists.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of sound produced in a dental clinic on the hearing of dentists in a dental school.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two dentists were evaluated for changes in their hearing thresholds at the Speech and Audiology Department, Manipal College of Allied Health Sciences, Manipal, India. Middle Ear Analyser (MEA), Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA) and Oto-Acoustic Emission (OAE) were used to evaluate changes in the hearing thresholds.RESULTS: There was a change in distortion product (DP) amplitude (temporary shift) in all frequencies. Statistically significant changes were found in the 6 kHz and 4 kHz ranges in the left ear and 6 kHz in the right ear. There was a larger DP shift in the left ear than in the right ear. A comparison of the hearing thresholds of males and females showed a significant difference of 3 kHz in the left ear, where males had a higher hearing loss.CONCLUSION: There were shifts of hearing threshold at 6 kHz and 4 kHz. The danger to hearing from dental clinic working environment in a dental school cannot be underestimated."
"17955688","Comparison of the previous and incoming categorisations of audiograms in the occupational health setting in Ireland.","Audiometry is a useful screening tool used in hearing conservation programmes carried out on our work force. Maintaining healthy hearing is essential as Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL), once established is irreversible. A categorisation system was developed to allow for simple triage by a non-specialist, (an occupational health nurse or audiologist) of Audiograms. Last year a new categorisation of audiograms was introduced in Ireland. I applied the previous categorisation and the new categorisation to 50 audiograms and compared the outcomes of each. The new categorisation results in fewer audiograms requiring referral to a specialist (14% versus 18%), fewer audiograms being classified at a warning level (6% versus 20%), and increases the percentage of normal audiograms (80% versus 60%). The new categorisation is more simplified, accounts for men having slightly worse higher frequency hearing than women and legislates for workers aged 18 years and older."
"17932017","Central auditory processing effects induced by solvent exposure.","OBJECTIVES: Various studies have demonstrated that organic solvent exposure may induce auditory damage. Studies conducted in workers occupationally exposed to solvents suggest, on the one hand, poorer hearing thresholds than in matched non-exposed workers, and on the other hand, central auditory damage due to solvent exposure. Taking into account the potential auditory damage induced by solvent exposure due to the neurotoxic properties of such substances, the present research aimed at studying the possible auditory processing disorder (APD), and possible hearing difficulties in daily life listening situations that solvent-exposed workers may acquire.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty workers exposed to a mixture of organic solvents (xylene, toluene, methyl ethyl ketone) and 50 non-exposed workers matched by age, gender and education were assessed. Only subjects with no history of ear infections, high blood pressure, kidney failure, metabolic and neurological diseases, or alcoholism were selected. The subjects had either normal hearing or sensorineural hearing loss, and normal tympanometric results. Hearing-in-noise (HINT), dichotic digit (DD), filtered speech (FS), pitch pattern sequence (PPS), and random gap detection (RGD) tests were carried out in the exposed and non-exposed groups. A self-report inventory of each subject's performance in daily life listening situations, the Amsterdam Inventory for Auditory Disability and Handicap, was also administered.RESULTS: Significant threshold differences between exposed and non-exposed workers were found at some of the hearing test frequencies, for both ears. However, exposed workers still presented normal hearing thresholds as a group (equal or better than 20 dB HL). Also, for the HINT, DD, PPS, FS and RGD tests, non-exposed workers obtained better results than exposed workers. Finally, solvent-exposed workers reported significantly more hearing complaints in daily life listening situations than non-exposed workers.CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that subjects exposed to solvents may acquire an APD and thus the sole use of pure-tone audiometry is insufficient to assess hearing in solvent-exposed populations."
"17903578","Vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials in chronic noise-induced hearing loss.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of chronic noise exposure on vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with chronic noise-induced hearing loss, presenting as bilateral notched audiogram at 4 kHz, underwent audiometry, caloric, and vestibular-evoked myogenic potential tests.RESULTS: Caloric and vestibular-evoked myogenic potential tests revealed abnormal responses in nine (45%) and 10 (50%) patients, respectively. However, when both results were considered together, the abnormal rate reached 70% (14 of 20). The hearing threshold of 4 kHz significantly associated with vestibular-evoked myogenic potential results (ie, vestibular-evoked myogenic potential was abnormal in patients with greater degrees of hearing loss), but not with caloric responses.CONCLUSION: Patients with bilateral 4-kHz notched audiogram and hearing threshold of 4 kHz &gt; 40 dB may show abnormal (absent or delayed) vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials, indicating that the vestibular part, especially the sacculocollic reflex pathway, has also been damaged."

We analyzed the relationships of cholesterol and triglyceride levels with NIHL.RESULTS: A total of 4071 cases were analyzed. After adjusting for age and gender, hypertriglyceridemia was found to be related to NIHL (aOR = 1.281; 95% CI, 1.088-1.507), but hypercholesterolemia was not (aOR = 0.951; 95% CI, 0.795-1.138).CONCLUSIONS: This study, one of the largest to date to study the relationship between hyperlipidemia and NIHL, found that individuals with hypertriglyceridemia are at greater risk of NIHL. On the basis of this finding, workers exposed to high noise levels should be educated on control of triglyceride levels to help reduce their risk of NIHL."
"17877829","The acute effects of alcohol on auditory thresholds.","BACKGROUND: There is very little knowledge about alcohol-induced hearing loss. Alcohol consumption and tolerance to loud noise is a well observed phenomenon as seen in the Western world where parties get noisier by the hour as the evening matures. This leads to increase in the referrals to the &quot;hearing aid clinic&quot; and the diagnosis of &quot;cocktail party deafness&quot; which may not necessarily be only due to presbyacusis or noise-induced hearing loss.METHODS: 30 healthy volunteers were recruited for this trial which took place in a controlled acoustic environment. Each of the individuals was required to consume a pre-set amount of alcohol and the hearing was tested (using full pure tone audiogram) pre- and post- alcohol consumption over a broad range of 6 frequencies. Volunteers who achieve a minimum breath alcohol threshold level of 30 u/l had to have second audiogram testing. All the volunteers underwent timed psychometric and visuo-spatial skills tests to detect the effect of alcohol on the decision-making and psychomotor co-ordination.RESULTS: Our results showed that there was a positive association between increasing breath alcohol concentration and the magnitude of the increase in hearing threshold for most hearing frequencies. This was calculated by using the Pearson Regression Coefficient Ratio which was up to 0.6 for hearing at 1000 Hz. Over 90% of subjects had raised auditory thresholds in three or more frequencies; this was more marked in the lower frequencies.CONCLUSION: Alcohol specifically blunts lower frequencies affecting the mostly 1000 Hz, which is the most crucial frequency for speech discrimination. In conclusion alcohol does appear to affect auditory thresholds with some frequencies being more affected than others."
"17851218","Toxic encephalopathy and noise-induced hearing loss.","In several laboratory animal studies, it has been documented that the hearing, vision, and brain can be injured due to exposure to organic solvents. This finding formed the background for a pilot study (n=16) aimed at identifying new ways of qualifying diagnostics, treatment, and rehabilitation of patients suffering from brain injury due to exposure to organic solvents, also referred to as toxic encephalopathy. Diagnosing toxic encephalopathy is complicated because the symptoms of this type of diffuse brain injury are non-specific. So, it was initially hypothesised that some of the difficulties involved in diagnosing toxic encephalopathy could be minimized by extending the diagnostic procedure. Apart from clinical interviewing and neuropsychological testing, the diagnosis should include the examination of hearing and vision. This will help in achieving new measures that could improve in diagnosing toxic encephalopathy with more certainty. On the basis of ranking, only one patient in the pilot study was considered to have a normal neuropsychological test profile, which was defined as a test profile without any marked deviations when compared with a normal population. A total of 10 patients were considered to have &quot;discrete problems.&quot; These patients had a test profile showing either a few strikingly negative results or an array of results slightly below the expected level when compared with a normal population. A total of four patients were considered to suffer from &quot;moderate problems&quot; and one patient from &quot;severe problems.&quot; The patients with &quot;moderate problems&quot; and &quot;severe problems&quot; showed consistent negative results and an unambiguous negative test profile. However, the overall results of all neuropsychological examinations performed revealed a dispersed picture. Quite remarkably, all the 13 patients who had their hearing examined showed a loss of hearing, 7 patients complained about tinnitus, and all patients had a history of exposure to both noise and organic solvents, which had not been observed at the initial examination, but seemed to have serious implications for their prognosis and future life."
"17804978","An assessment of threshold shifts in nonprofessional pop/rock musicians using conventional and extended high-frequency audiometry.","The clinical value of extended high-frequency audiometry for the detection of noise-induced hearing loss has not been established conclusively. The purpose of this study was to assess the relative temporary threshold shift (TTS) in two frequency regions (conventional versus extended high frequency). In this exploratory study, pure-tone thresholds from 0.5 to 14 kHz were measured in both ears of 16 nonprofessional pop/rock musicians (mean age, 35 yr; range, 27 to 49 yr), before and after a 90-minute rehearsal session. All had experienced repeated exposures to intense sound levels during at least 5 yr of their musical careers. After the rehearsal, median threshold levels were found to be significantly poorer for frequencies from 0.5 to 8 kHz (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p &lt;or= 0.004) but were unchanged in the extended high-frequency range from 9 to 14 kHz. Decreases in the median threshold values measured before the rehearsal were present across the conventional frequency range, most notably at 6 kHz, but were not observed in the extended high-frequency range. On the basis of these results, extended high-frequency audiometry does not seem advantageous as a means of the early detection of noise-induced hearing loss."
"17804195","No evidence for enhanced noise induced hearing loss after prenatal stress or dexamethasone.","It was recently implied that prenatal stress and fetal exposure to glucocorticoids may interfere with hearing ability and noise induced hearing loss in adulthood. In the present study pregnant Wistar rats were stressed during gestation by Chronic Mild Stress (CMS, a variable schedule of different stressors) or by dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid, i.e. a pharmacological stressor). At birth, but not at weaning, the dexamethasone offspring exhibited significantly decreased body weight compared to both control offspring and progeny from dams exposed to CMS during pregnancy. As adults, male offspring were exposed to 105 dB sound pressure level (SPL) wide band noise either continuously for eight hours or for two hours per day on three consecutive days. Oto-acoustic emissions and auditory brainstem responses were recorded before and after exposure to noise. Neither prenatal chronic stress nor prenatal dexamethasone exposure was associated with significantly enhanced noise induced hearing loss compared to controls, and these results were consistent in both subsets of animals. Our data do not support previous reports that prenatal exposure to mild stress nor to dexamethasone is detrimental to the hearing organ per se. However, hearing may be modulated by prenatal stressors under certain circumstances, of which the timing and degree are probably the most important."

"17721363","Otoacoustic emissions in early noise-induced hearing loss.","OBJECTIVE: To follow changes in transient evoked and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs, DPOAEs) as they relate to pure-tone audiometry (PTaud) thresholds during the first 2 years of occupational noise exposure.DESIGN: Prospective controlled.METHODS: Pure-tone audiometry thresholds, TEOAE and DPOAE amplitudes, and contralateral medial olivocochlear reflex strength were repeatedly evaluated during 2 years and compared between and within a cohort of 135 ship engine room recruits and a control group of 100 subjects with no noise exposure.RESULTS: Pure-tone audiometry thresholds for 2,000, 3,000 and 4,000 Hz in both ears were significantly elevated in the study group after 2 years of noise exposure. Significantly lower TEOAE amplitudes were found at 2,000 Hz in the right ear and 2,000 and 4,000 Hz in the left ear. Longitudinal intrasubject analysis of the study group revealed significant reductions of TEOAE amplitudes at 2,000 to 4,000 Hz in both ears and reduced DPOAE amplitudes for 5,957 Hz in the right ear and 3,809, 4,736, and 5,957 Hz in the left ear in the second follow-up evaluation. Baseline medial olivocochlear reflex strength showed no correlation to PTaud thresholds after 2 years of noise exposure. Poor to moderate negative linear correlations (r = -0.07 to -0.37) were found between the DPOAE-averaged amplitudes at 2,979 to 5,957 Hz and PTaud threshold means at 3,000 to 6,000 Hz. Abnormal TEOAE parameters after the first year of noise exposure had high sensitivity (86-88%) and low specificity (33-35%) for the prediction of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) after 2 years.CONCLUSION: The DP-gram is not significantly correlated with PTaud and cannot be used as an objective measure of pure-tone thresholds in early NIHL. Medial olivocochlear reflex strength before the beginning of chronic exposure to occupational noise has no relation to individual vulnerability to NIHL. Although TEOAEs changes after 1 year showed high sensitivity in predicting NIHL after 2 years of exposure, they cannot be recommended as an efficient screening tool due to high false-positive rates."
"17712672","Intratympanic treatment of acute acoustic trauma with a cell-permeable JNK ligand: a prospective randomized phase I/II study.","OBJECTIVES: Intratympanic administration of a cell-permeable JNK ligand has been shown to prevent hearing loss after acute acoustic trauma in animal models.CONCLUSIONS: Functional and morphological analysis of the treated ears revealed that AM-111 had an excellent otoprotective effect, even when administered hours after the noise exposure. Blocking the signal pathway with D-JNKI-1 is therefore a promising way to protect the morphological integrity and physiological function of the inner ear in various conditions involving acute sensorineural hearing loss.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: For the first application of AM-111 in humans, we organized a clinical phase I/II trial in patients with acute acoustic trauma after exposure to firecrackers in Berlin and Munich on New Year's Eve 2005/2006. We randomly selected 11 patients for intratympanic treatment with AM-111 at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml or 2 mg/ml within 24 h after noise exposure. Pure tone audiometry and otoacoustic emissions were assessed before treatment and on days 3 and 30 thereafter.RESULTS: Based on clinical experience and on a calculation using an empirically derived exponential hearing recovery function AM-111 seems to have had a therapeutic effect. A total of 13 adverse events were reported in 5 study participants. None of the adverse events were serious or severe."
"17711774","Risk of damage to hearing from personal listening devices in young adults.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of personal listening device use on hearing in young listeners.METHODS: Conventional frequency audiometry (0.5-8 kHz) and extended high-frequency audiometry (10-20 kHz) were performed on 120 personal listening device users and 30 normal-hearing young adults.RESULTS: The hearing thresholds in the 3 to 8 kHz frequency range were significantly increased in the personal listening device listeners. The frequency range of the increased thresholds became broad as the exposure duration was increased. Impaired hearing was detected in 14.1% (34 of 240 ears) of ears (&gt; 25 dB HL in one or more frequencies in 0.5-8 kHz). The hearing thresholds of extended high-frequency audiometry in personal listening device users could also be increased even if their hearing thresholds in conventional frequency audiometry were normal.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that long-term use of personal listening devices can impair hearing function The data also indicate that extended high-frequency audiometry is a sensitive method for early detection of noise-induced hearing loss."
"17687184","Age-related hearing loss and blood pressure.","A review of the literature studying possible correlations between hearing function and cardiovascular disease (CVD) reveals a complex and somewhat contradictory picture. Most studies favor the concept of an association between hearing loss and CVD. The issue of interactions between noise-induced hearing loss and CVD, as well as between age-related hearing loss and CVD, has been discussed in numerous publications. The present study utilizes information from an epidemiological study of elderly people in Gothenburg, Sweden. We found a probable correlation between high systolic blood pressure and hearing loss in the low and mid frequencies in elderly women, 79 years old. A tendency of a similar correlation was also found in a group of 85-year-old women. An association between high diastolic blood pressure and low- and mid-frequency hearing loss was also found in the group of women aged 85 years. No consistent associations between blood pressure or hypertension and auditory function were found in 70- and 75-year-old women or in men 70 to 85 years old."
"17614497","Overexposure effects of a 1-kHz tone on the distortion product otoacoustic emission in humans.","The effects of overexposure on the properties of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) are investigated. In total, 39 normal-hearing humans were monaurally exposed to a 1-kHz tone lasting for 3 min at an equivalent threshold sound-pressure level of 105.5 dB. The effects of overexposure were studied in two experiments (1) on the broadband DPOAE and (2) on the DPOAE fine structure, measured using a higher frequency resolution in a narrower frequency range. The obtained DPOAE shifts were compared to temporary threshold shift (TTS) obtained after a similar exposure. Similarities between DPOAE shifts and TTS were found in the affected frequency range and the time course of recovery. The amount of TTS was higher in the early recovery time (1-4-min postexposure), but similar to the DPOAE shift (even in absolute terms) at later recovery times (5-20-min postexposure). The DPOAE fine structure was not systematically changed after the exposure."
"17605828","Interaction of smoking and occupational noise exposure on hearing loss: a cross-sectional study.","BACKGROUND: Noise is the most common hazardous agent at workplaces. Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) has been known since the industrial revolution. Although NIHL is permanent, irreversible and frequent, it is preventable. The economic costs of NIHL have been estimated to be about billions of dollars. Besides, cigarette smoking is a common habit worldwide, and according to some recent studies smoking and noise may act in common causal pathways for hearing loss.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed to study the effect of smoking on NIHL in 206 male smoker workers and 206 male non-smoker workers in a large food-producing factory, in which workers were exposed to noise levels exceeding 85 dBA. To determine noise exposure level, we used sound level measurements reported by industrial hygienists.A qualified audiologist assessed hearing acuity by using standardized audiometric procedures assuring at least 14 h of noise avoidance.RESULTS: We observed that the percentage of workers with hearing threshold differences of greater than or equal to 30 dB between 4000 Hz and 1000 Hz in both ears were 49.5% and 11.2% in smoker and non smoker groups, respectively (Odds ratio = 7.8, 95% CI = 4.7-13), and the percentage of workers with a hearing threshold of greater than 25 dB at 4000 Hz in the better ear were 63.6% and 18.4% in smoker and non smoker groups, respectively. This difference was statistically significant after adjustment for age and exposure duration.CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that smoking can accelerate noise induced hearing loss, but more research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms. Accurate follow up of smoker workers who are exposed to noise levels exceeding 85 dBA is suggested. Smokers should periodically attend educational courses on &quot;smoking cessation&quot;, especially in noisy workplaces."

Study model - a prospective clinical trial.</AbstractText>: Teachers frequently report auditory symptoms and excessive noise in classrooms, but noise level measurements are not done routinely. Study model - a prospective clinical trial.AIM: To study auditory symptoms and audiometric exams of teachers and classroom noise levels.MATERIAL AND METHOD: Data from two groups, GI (40 teachers) and GII (40 voluntaries) were studied as follows: age, gender, working conditions, audiometric exams, and classroom noise levels.RESULTS: In GI there were more females (86%), working in basic teaching (75%), in classes with 21-40 students (70%), with workloads between 26 and 40 hours per week (47%), and variable professional teaching time. Most teachers in GI reported excessive classroom noise (93.5%) and auditory symptoms (65%). In GI, 25% of teachers presented audiometric alterations (versus 10% of controls), with an acoustic notch predominating (11.25%; p&lt;0.05). Noise levels close to 87dBA were recorded in classes at all teaching levels.CONCLUSIONS: occupational hearing loss may occur in teachers. Further studies are needed to confirm this proposition."
"17567727","Organic solvent exposure and hearing loss in a cohort of aluminium workers.","OBJECTIVES: Organic solvent exposure has been shown to cause hearing loss in animals and humans. Less is known about the risk of hearing loss due to solvent exposures typically found in US industry. The authors performed a retrospective cohort study to examine the relationship between solvent exposure and hearing loss in US aluminium industry workers.METHODS: A cohort of 1319 workers aged 35 years or less at inception was followed for 5 years. Linkage of employment, industrial hygiene and audiometric surveillance records allowed for estimation of noise and solvent exposures and hearing loss rates over the study period. Study subjects were classified as &quot;solvent exposed&quot; or not, on the basis of industrial hygiene records linked with individual job histories. High frequency hearing loss was modelled as both a continuous and a dichotomous outcome.RESULTS: Typical solvent exposures involved mixtures of xylene, toluene and/or methyl ethyl ketone (MEK). Recorded solvent exposure levels varied widely both within and between jobs. In a multivariate logistic model, risk factors for high frequency hearing loss included age (OR = 1.06, p = 0.004), hunting or shooting (OR = 1.35, p = 0.049), noisy hobbies (OR = 1.74, p = 0.01), baseline hearing level (OR = 1.04, p&lt;0.001) and solvent exposure (OR = 1.87, p = 0.004). A multivariate linear regression analysis similarly found significant associations between high frequency hearing loss and age (p&lt;0.001), hunting or shooting (p&lt;0.001), noisy hobbies (p = 0.03), solvent exposure (p&lt;0.001) and baseline hearing (p = 0.03).CONCLUSION: These results suggest that occupational exposure to organic solvent mixtures is a risk factor for high frequency hearing loss, although the data do not allow conclusions about dose-response relationships. Industries with solvent-exposed workers should include such workers in hearing conservation programs."
"17497600","[Asymmetrical hearing loss following symmetrical acute acoustic trauma].","Due to diffraction, acute acoustic trauma usually causes symmetrical hearing loss. Acoustical shadow effects are relevant only at distances greater than 1 m to the sound source and frequencies greater than 1000 Hz. In case of pronounced asymmetrical hearing loss causal connection to acute acoustic trauma is unlikely. We describe two cases with pronounced asymmetrical hearing loss in spite of symmetrical acute acoustic trauma. In the first case two patients headed an exploding giant tyre in a distance of approximately 1-2 m. One of them--as expected--got a symmetrical inner ear damage. On the other hand the other patient, which stayed directly besides him, got a pronounced asymmetrical inner ear damage. In an additional case we found also asymmetrical inner ear damage after symmetrical noise exposure. In this case it was detected, that years ago the patient suffered from a menieriform attack in the now worse ear. Occult inner ear damage is discussed as a reason for the phenomenon of pronounced asymmetrical inner ear damage after symmetrical noise exposure."
"17478967","Effect of exposure to a mixture of solvents and noise on hearing and balance in aircraft maintenance workers.","Aircraft maintenance workers are exposed to a mixture of solvents in the presence of intermittent noise. For this study these workers exposed to solvent mix and noise, were compared with mill workers exposed to noise alone, printed circuit board operatives exposed to solvents alone and those exposed to none who acted as controls. Tympanometry, acoustic reflex thresholds, transient and distortion product otoacoustic emissions, auditory brainstem potentials, nystagmography and posturography were examined. There was a significant effect on pure tone thresholds for both noise and solvents+noise. The distortion product otoacoustic emissions declined with frequency and exhibited lower DP amplitude with noise compared to solvents and noise group. The transient emissions showed a similar effect. Over 32% of subjects with solvent and noise exposure had abnormalities of the auditory brainstem responses in terms of interwave interval prolongation. The mean acoustic reflex thresholds showed a pattern of differences which differentiate noise from solvent and noise groups. The contralateral pathway appears to be differentially affected by solvent exposure. 32% of subjects in the solvents and noise group had an abnormal posturographic finding. In the solvents and noise group 74% had abnormalities of saccades, 56% of pursuit and 45% of optokinetic nystagmus."

The records of environmental noise and solvents measurements and the results of annual audiometry performed by the company were examined. The audiometric results of workers from olefin operational areas 1 and 2 and aromatic plant areas exposed to solvents and noise and utility area workers exposed only to noise were analyzed for the standard threshold shift (STS). Despite the low exposures to solvents and a moderate exposure to noise, 45.3% of workers had hearing losses and 29.6% had STS."
"17478963","Sleep quality in noise exposed Brazilian workers.","This study investigated the effect of chronic workplace exposure to excessive noise on sleep quality. It involved 40 male workers aged 33 to 50 years, 20 of whom had been exposed to environmental workplace noise levels of 85 dB or more on 40-hour-a-week jobs. Another 20 workers who were not exposed to excessive noise were used as controls. All subjects were interviewed and submitted to physical examination, pure tone and speech audiometry, immittance testing and nocturnal polysomnography. Comparative analysis demonstrated that the two groups were similar, except for the exposure to noise. Fisher's test comparison of pure tone and speech audiometry and immittance testing revealed mild to moderate noise-induced hearing loss (P &lt; 0.001) in the &gt; or = 85-dB group. Indicators of sleep continuity were abnormal in both groups, demonstrating poor sleep quality; however, sleep quantity was normal. Of the 40 individuals, 13 (32.5%) presented respiratory sleep disorders. Of those 13, 10 presented daytime somnolence according to the Epworth Scale. The Mann-Whitney test showed that sleep was identical in the two groups. Fisher's exact test revealed no association between altered sleep and hearing status in either group. Our results show that active men working 40-hour-a-week in the presence of excessive noise without adequate protection for more than eight years presented with noise-induced hearing loss but their quality or quantity of night sleep was unaffected. Sensori-neural deafness may represent an element of adaptation against noise during sleep."

"17402219","Individual susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss: choosing an optimal method of retrospective classification of workers into noise-susceptible and noise-resistant groups.","OBJECTIVES: Individual susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) depends on the interaction between intrinsic and environmental factors. To proceed with the study on NIHL susceptibility genes an appropriate selection of workers susceptible and resistant to noise is crucial. The aim of the study was to compare four different methods of subject classification by the susceptibility to NIHL in a group of 949 workers of an electric power plant exposed to steady-state noise at the workplace.MATERIALS AND METHODS: One method based the classification of the workers on the international reference standard ISO 1999:1990; from the entire group of workers, 10% of the subjects with the worst hearing thresholds (HT) in the model were categorized as susceptible to NIHL, whereas 10% of the subjects with the best HT were categorized as resistant to noise. According to three other methods, the entire group of workers was first divided into subgroups by age, duration of employment and the level of noise, and then 10% of the subjects at each HT extreme were selected.RESULTS: The first classification allowed to achieve an excellent separation between HT of the susceptible and resistant subgroups. The susceptible subgroup was significantly younger than the resistant one, showed a shorter duration of employment and a lower level of noise exposure, which is in line with the definition of increased vulnerability to NIHL. The three other methods produced poorer separation of HT with smaller or no gap between HT values in subgroups.CONCLUSIONS: The selection of subjects from the entire worker population of a given industry based on the ISO 1999:1990 standard can be regarded as the most reliable method of classification of noise-susceptible and noise-resistant workers to be used in the future genetic studies on NIHL susceptibility genes."
"17348531","Effective compression and noise reduction configurations for hearing protectors.","The author proposed to adopt wide dynamic range compression and adaptive multichannel modulation-based noise reduction algorithms to enhance hearing protector performance. Three experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of compression and noise reduction configurations on the amount of noise reduction, speech intelligibility, and overall preferences using existing digital hearing aids. In Experiment 1, sentence materials were recorded in speech spectrum noise and white noise after being processed by eight digital hearing aids. When the hearing aids were set to 3:1 compression, the amount of noise reduction achieved was enhanced or maintained for hearing aids with parallel configurations, but reduced for hearing aids with serial configurations. In Experiments 2 and 3, 16 normal-hearing listeners' speech intelligibility and perceived sound quality were tested when they listened to speech recorded through hearing aids with parallel and serial configurations. Regardless of the configuration, the noise reduction algorithms reduced the noise level and maintained speech intelligibility in white noise. Additionally, the listeners preferred the parallel rather than the serial configuration in 3:1 conditions and the serial configuration in 1:1 rather than 3:1 compression when the noise reduction algorithms were activated. Implications for hearing protector and hearing aid design are discussed."
"17298149","Hearing-impairment among workers in a surface gold mining company in Ghana.","A study to determine the impact of hazardous noise on workers was conducted in a surface gold mining company in Ghana. The procedure adopted included noise survey, case history, otoscopy and conventional pure-tone audiometry. Five main areas were surveyed for hazardous noise namely, Pit, Processing, Ana Laboratory, Bore-hole and Mess area. The results showed that all the above areas except the Mess area produced noise levels above 85 dBA. Again, a total of 252 workers were seen at the company, and out of this number 59(23%) had the classical noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) at 4 KHz. In addition, NIHL increased as a function of age and duration of exposure. It is also noted that out of 81 workers with a preemployment history of noise exposure, 41(51%) had NIHL. NIHL also varied with regard to job location. 14(6%) of the workers had hearing loss greater than 25 dB at the speech frequencies. Thus, factors not under the control of the company may affect the hearing of an employee."
"17298117","Industrial noise pollution and its effects on the hearing capabilities of workers: A study from saw mills, printing presses and corn mills.","The purpose of this study was to ascertain industrial noise pollution and its effects on the hearing capabilities of workers. The procedure adopted included noise measurements, otoscopy, audiometric evaluation and assessment of medical history. The results showed that noise levels in corn mills and saw mills exceed 85dBA. The average noise level measured in the printing industry was 85dBA. It was also found that 23 %, 20 % and 7.9 % of workers in corn mills, saw mills and the printing industry have evidence of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). A highly significant correlation was found between noise exposure level, duration of exposure and the development of NIHL in corm mills and saw mills but not in the printers. Hearing - impairment was also observed at the speech frequencies among some of the workers exposed to hazardous noise. These findings suggest that more specific intervention is required to protect workers exposed to such hazards at the work places employed in this study."
"17272301","Hearing loss, accidents, near misses and job losses in firefighters.","BACKGROUND: The hearing losses of workers exposed to occupational noise have been extensively documented, but no information exists on the level of hearing loss which results in job loss.AIM: To define levels of hearing loss associated with ill-health retirement (IHR), comparing them with existing standards and assessing the extent to which poor hearing contributes to accidents and near misses to assist the development of rational standards for retention.METHODS: All UK local authority fire brigades were approached for information on IHRs due to audiological problems, accident/near-miss totals and the numbers thought to be due to poor hearing in a 60-month period beginning in 1997.RESULTS: Only 15/59 (25%) of brigades provided all information requested, although 50 (85%) and 32 (52%) supplied medical and safety information, respectively, which was used for analysis. Of 3366 IHRs, 135 (4%) were due to audiological problems. When compared to a control group of firefighters of similar age, those taking IHR had worse mean and median hearing losses in all grouped frequencies in both ears than the controls, and this difference always reached statistical significance (P &lt; 0.001), but there was considerable overlap in terms of range of hearing loss in each group. Only 41/31 274 (0.13%) of accidents/near misses reported were believed to result from hearing problems, and seven of these were related to device failure.CONCLUSIONS: Retention criteria based on audiometric grounds alone may result in unnecessary IHRs. Poor hearing is only responsible for a small proportion of accidents and near misses."
"17249147","A psychoacoustical model for specifying the level and spectrum of acoustic warning signals in the workplace.","A psychoacoustic model is presented to facilitate the installation of acoustic warning devices in noisy settings, reflecting a major upgrade of a former tool, Detectsound. The model can be used to estimate the optimal level and spectrum of acoustic warning signals based on the noise field in the workplace, the hearing status of workers, and the attenuation provided by hearing protectors. The new version can be applied to a wider range of situations. Analyses can now be conducted to meet the functional requirements for a specific worker or to suit the needs for a group of co-workers sharing a work area. Computation of optimal warning signals can also be made from estimated hearing parameters based on the worker age, gender, and level and duration of noise exposure. The results of a laboratory validation study showed that the mean error in estimating detection thresholds for normal hearing individuals is typically within +/-1 dB with a standard deviation of less than 2.5 dB in white noise or continuous noise fields. The model tends to yield slightly overestimated warning signal detection thresholds in fluctuating noises. Proper application of the tool also requires consideration of the variability in estimating noise levels, hearing status, and hearing protector attenuation under field conditions to ensure that acoustic warning signals are sufficiently loud and well adjusted in practice."
"17228988","Efficacy of a computer-based hearing test and tailored hearing protection intervention.","Advances in computer technology and accessibility enable researchers to provide individually tailored interventions for behavioral change. Using multimedia technology, this study developed and tested a computer-based hearing test and a tailored intervention. The purpose of this study was to evaluate, using a randomized experimental design, the efficacy of the intervention to increase workers' use of hearing protection. The tailored intervention developed by the research team showed more significant short-term effect measured immediately after the intervention than the control intervention. For the long-term effect measured 1 year after the intervention, both tailored and control groups showed significant increase in their reported use (7% vs. 6%) from preintervention to postintervention, but no significant difference between the two groups. The change accomplished in this study was small progress toward the desired level of 100% use of hearing protection to prevent noise-induced hearing loss. This finding showed that changing workers' hearing protection behavior is difficult."

The issue of toxicity is of special concern in young men with a probability of cure of at least 70-80% even in disseminated disease. As the literature shows, the ototoxic side effects of cisplatin have been studied mostly by conventional method. The authors used distortion product otoacoustic emission to detect the long-term ototoxic effect of cisplatin in 223 patients with a median follow-up time of 4.27 years (range 0.5-20 years) and a median age of 37 years (range 18-55 years). Cisplatin (20 mg/m(2) body surface) was administered for five days per cycle, in combination with other antitumor drugs. The control group consisted of 40 testicular cancer patients who did not receive chemotherapy, with a median age of 35 years (range 16-54 years). A detailed medical history based on a standardized questionnaire evaluated hearing complaints and audiological risk factors, such as head injuries, chronic otitis media, previous noise exposure and familial hearing loss. DPOAE was measured at 8 frequencies from 750 to 8000 Hz. No amplitude changes were detected in patients receiving =300 mg/m(2) cisplatin. At higher doses, contrary to the literature, not only high frequencies were affected: our method could detect significant hearing impairment at lower frequencies important for speech perception in patients receiving at least 400 mg/m(2) cisplatin. The lower frequencies where significant amplitude changes were detected were 3000 Hz at 400 mg/m(2), and 1500, 2000 and 3000 Hz at 500-600 mg/m(2). We detected the worst hearing in the case of patients who had symptomatic ototoxicity. Age and the cumulative dose of cisplatin proved statistically significant risk factors, while smoking or noise exposure did not have predictive value. As a conclusion, DPOAE is a fast, noninvasive and reliable method for the detection of late ototoxicity in testicular cancer patients. In our study hearing loss correlated with the cumulative dose of cisplatin. Hearing impairment contributes to the already compromised situation of cancer patients."

We reviewed our experience with intratympanic steroids in the treatment of patients with sudden SNHL to determine overall success, morbidity, and prognostic factors.HYPOTHESIS: Intratympanic steroids have minimal morbidity and the potential to have a positive effect on hearing recovery in patients with sudden SNHL who have failed systemic therapy.STUDY DESIGN: The authors conducted a retrospective review.METHODS: Patients presenting with sudden SNHL defined as a rapid decline in hearing over 3 days or less affecting 3 or more frequencies by 30 dB or greater who underwent intratympanic steroids therapy (24 mg/mL dexamethasone) were reviewed. Excluded were patients with Meniere disease, retrocochlear disease, autoimmune HL, trauma, fluctuating HL, radiation-induced HL, noise-induced HL, or any other identifiable etiology for sudden HL. Patients who showed signs of fluctuation of hearing after injection were excluded. Pretreatment and posttreatment audiometric evaluations including pure-tone average (PTA) and speech reception threshold (SRT) were analyzed. Patient variables as they related to recovery were studied and included patient age, time to onset of therapy, status of the contralateral ear, presence of diabetes, severity of HL, and presence of associated symptoms (tinnitus, vertigo). A 20-dB gain in PTA or a 20% improvement in SDS was considered significant.RESULTS: : Forty patients fit the criteria for inclusion in the study. The mean age of the patients was 54.8 years with a range from 17 to 84 years of age. Overall, 40% (n = 16) showed any improvement in PTA or SDS. Fourteen (35%) men and 26 (65%) women were included. Using the criteria of 20-dB improvement in PTA or 20% improvement in SDS for success, 27.5% (n = 11) showed improvement. The mean number of days from onset of symptoms to intratympanic therapy was 40 days with a range of 7 days to 310 days. A statistically significant difference was noted in those patients who received earlier injection (P = .0008, rank sum test). No patient receiving intratympanic dexamethasone after 36 days recovered hearing using 20-dB PTA decrease or a 20% increase in discrimination as criteria for recovery. Twelve percent (n = 5) of patients in the study had diabetes with 20% recovering after intratympanic dexamethasone (not significantly different from nondiabetics at 28.6%, Fisher exact test, P = 1.0). Comparison to other studies that used differing steroid type, concentration, dosing schedule, inclusion criteria, and criteria for success revealed, in many instances, a similar overall recovery rate.CONCLUSIONS: Difficulty in proving efficacy of a single modality is present in all studies on SNHL secondary to multiple treatment protocols, variable rates of recovery, and a high rate of spontaneous recovery. Forty percent of patients showed some improvement in SDS or PTA after treatment failure. When criteria of 20-dB PTA or 20% is considered to define improvement, the recovery rate was 27.5%. Modest improvement is seen with the current protocol of a single intratympanic steroid injection of 24 mg/mL dexamethasone in patients who failed systemic therapy. Dramatic hearing recovery in treatment failures was rarely encountered. No patient showed significant benefit from intratympanic steroids after 36 days when using this protocol for idiopathic sudden SNHL. If patients injected after 6 weeks are excluded from the study, the improvement rate increases from 26.9% to 39.3%. Earlier intratympanic injection had a significant impact on hearing recovery, although with any therapeutic intervention for sudden SNHL, early success may be attributed to natural history. If we further exclude seven patients treated with intratympanic steroids within 2 weeks of the onset of symptoms (i.e., study only those patients treated with intratympanic dexamethasone between 2 and 6 weeks after onset of symptoms), still, 26% improved by 20 dB or 20% SDS. The recovery rates after initial systemic failure are higher than would be expected in this treatment failure group given our control group (9.1%) and literature review. These findings indicate a positive effect from steroid perfusion in this patient population."

Solvents are neurotoxic substances that are detrimental to the functioning of the nervous system, including the central auditory nervous system (CANS). This study investigated hearing and auditory processing in seven individuals with a history of exposure to industrial solvents. A battery of audiological tests was administered to all subjects: pure tone, speech, and impedance audiometry, otoacoustic emissions tests, auditory brainstem responses, middle latency responses, as well as the SCAN-A and R-SPIN tests with low predictability sentence lists. All individuals in this study exhibited findings consistent with retrocochlear and/or central abnormality. Two of the seven subjects in this study had normal pure tone thresholds at all frequencies bilaterally, yet showed abnormal retrocochlear/central results on one or more tests. The auditory test battery approach used in this study appears to be valuable in evaluating the pathological conditions of the CANS in solvent-exposed individuals."

The last test was used to study hearing loss. The mean test values at 3, 4, 6 kHz were used for the ear with worse hearing loss. Data were compared with a Swedish population (n = 603) who were not occupationally exposed to noise. Equivalent noise levels (Leq) were measured in different aircraft.RESULTS: Leq was 78-84 dB (A), maximum A-weighted exposure was 114 dB. Median values for all ages were close to the reference group. No association was found between years of employment and hearing loss, when adjusting for age and gender by multiple logistic regression analysis.CONCLUSION: Cabin crew are exposed to equivalent noise levels below the current Swedish occupational standard, and have normal age-matched hearing threshold levels."

Conventional audiometry in the frequency range 0.25-8 kHz and EHF audiometry in the frequency range 9-20 kHz were performed.RESULTS: Thresholds in the noise-exposed group were higher than in the control group for both standard and extended high frequencies, but variability was greater in EHF. Larger differences were found in the 4,000-18,000 Hz frequency region, and especially in the 12,500-18,000 frequency zone. A statistically significant correlation between the elevation of puretone thresholds and time of exposure was found across all frequencies (from 250 to 20,000 Hz), with the exception of 10,000 Hz.CONCLUSIONS: EHF audiometry is a useful adjunct to conventional audiometry in the audiological assessment of subjects exposed to occupational noise.

Aim of the study is to identify the minimal level of hearing loss over which the patient felt changes in his quality of life, and the average auditory threshold at which the patient considered the application of a hearing aid useful or necessary. The sample comprised 180 males with noise-induced hearing loss. Each subject received a questionnaire designed for this study. Data show a correlation between disability, handicap and the degree of noise-induced hearing loss. The most relevant problems in noise-induced hearing loss are correlated with disability rather than handicap. 35 dB can be considered as the level above which these devices can be suggested to patients. Hearing aids can become a therapeutic instrument even in the presence of a low degree of hearing loss."
"18936359","Physiological and morphological assessment of the saccule in Guinea pigs after noise exposure.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the saccule exhibits temporary or permanent functional loss resembling threshold shifts in auditory brainstem response (ABR) of guinea pigs following noise exposure.DESIGN: Randomly bred guinea pigs were divided into 3 groups: A (short-term noise exposure, 30 minutes, n = 15), B (long-term noise exposure, 40 hours, n = 9), and C (no noise exposure, n = 5).SETTING: University hospital.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All animals underwent vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) and ABR tests. Chronological changes of VEMP and ABR responses following noise exposure were analyzed and compared. After audiovestibular function testing, animals were killed for morphological study with light and electron microscopy.RESULTS: In group A, temporary VEMP loss and ABR threshold shifts recovered 2 and 4 days, respectively, after short-term noise exposure, with an interval of 2 days earlier in the recovery of VEMPs than that of ABR thresholds. In contrast, in group B, 78% and 83% of the ears exhibited permanent VEMP loss and ABR threshold shifts, respectively, 10 days following long-term noise exposure. In group C, all animals showed normal VEMPs and ABRs throughout the study period. Light and electron microscopic studies confirmed that loss of VEMPs correlated with saccular lesion.CONCLUSIONS: The saccule can exhibit temporary or permanent functional loss resembling hearing threshold shifts in guinea pigs following noise exposure. Recovery of VEMP precedes restoration of hearing threshold after damage from short-term noise exposure. Conversely, permanent VEMP loss after long-term noise exposure may reflect permanent hearing threshold shifts."

"18760091","Association of work-related accidents with noise exposure in the workplace and noise-induced hearing loss based on the experience of some 240,000 person-years of observation.","This retrospective study explores the association between occupational noise exposure at the time of hearing tests, permanent noise-induced hearing loss and work-related accident risk. Log-binomial analysis was used to first ascertain the association between study variables according to activity sector (North American Industry Classification System, NAICS) and accident context while controlling for age. Second part of the paper estimates the overall number of accidents attributable to occupational noise or the associated hearing loss (excess fraction). Study was carried on a sample of 52,982 male workers exposed to a minimum of 80 dBA on a daily basis and whose hearing was examined at least once between 1983 and 1996 by public health authorities of Quebec. These participants evidenced bilateral average hearing threshold levels at 3, 4 and 6 kHz ranging from normal (&lt; or = 15 dB) to hearing loss in excess of 50 dB as a result of chronic occupational noise exposure (subjects otherwise otologically normal). The occupational accident count of these workers was derived from the individual histories registered with the Quebec workers' compensation board for the 1983-1998 period. Results show an association between accident risk and worker's hearing sensitivity. For example, a hearing loss of 20 dB corresponds to a rise of accident risk equal to 1.14 when controlling for age and occupational noise exposure at the time of hearing tests. NAICS economic activity sectors where association is the most noticeable are &quot;Metal Transformation&quot;, &quot;Metal Product Manufacturing&quot; and &quot;Transportation Equipment Manufacturing&quot;. &quot;Passive accidents&quot; (PR per decibel of hearing loss = 1.008; CI 95 (1.007; 1.010)) and &quot;same-level falls&quot; (1.007; CI 95 (1.003; 1.010)) are the two accidents categories most strongly associated with hearing loss. Overall, 12.2% of accidents considered in this study were attributable to a combination of noise exposure in the workplace (&gt; or = 90 dBA) and noise-induced hearing loss."
"18726988","The impact of hearing conservation programs on incidence of noise-induced hearing loss in Canadian workers.","BACKGROUND: Noise exposure remains one of the most ubiquitous of occupational hazards. Hearing conservation program legislation and the programs themselves were designed to lower risk of resulting occupational noise-induced hearing loss, but there has been no broad-based effort to assess the effectiveness of this policy.METHODS: The incidence of a 10-dB standard threshold shift was examined in a group of Canadian lumber mill workers, using annual audiogram series obtained from the Workers' Compensation Board of British Columbia for the period 1979-1996 and using Cox proportional hazard models.RESULTS: Mean cumulative noise exposure was 98.1 dB-years. The audiograms from 22,376 individuals, among whom there were 2,839 threshold shifts of 10 dB or greater (i.e., a &quot;standard threshold shift&quot;), were retained in multivariable analyses. After adjusting for potential confounders, continuous use of hearing protection, and initial hearing tests later in the study period, the risk for standard threshold shift was reduced by 30%. Risk increased sixfold, however, in those with the highest noise exposure.CONCLUSIONS: Hearing conservation programs may be effective in reducing overall incidence of hearing loss. In the absence of noise control at source, however, highly exposed workers remain at unnecessary risk."
"18713646","Noise exposure-induced enhancement of auditory cortex response and changes in gene expression.","Noise exposure is one of the most common causes of hearing loss. There is growing evidence suggesting that noise-induced peripheral hearing loss can also induce functional changes in the central auditory system. However, the physiological and biological changes in the central auditory system induced by noise exposure are poorly understood. To address these issues, neurophysiological recordings were made from the auditory cortex (AC) of awake rats using chronically implanted electrodes before and after acoustic overstimulation. In addition, focused gene microarrays and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to identify changes in gene expression in the AC. Monaural noise exposure (120 dB sound pressure level, 1 h) significantly elevated hearing threshold on the exposed ear and induced a transient enhancement on the AC response amplitude 4 h after the noise exposure recorded from the unexposed ear. This increase of the cortical neural response amplitude was associated with an upregulation of genes encoding heat shock protein (HSP) 27 kDa and 70 kDa after several hours of the noise exposure. These results suggest that noise exposure can induce a fast physiological change in the AC which may be related to the changes of HSP expressions."

Sound level readings were taken three times a day. Generally, the traffic noise levels were between 75 dBA to 85 dBA. The maximum sound level recorded was 108.2 dBA. Noise emitted by traffic equipment and vehicles were up to 133 dBA. Results of audiometric tests revealed that out of 30 who were tested, 24 or 80% were positive for noise-induced hearing loss. A questionnaire survey revealed a lack of knowledge on occupational safety and personal protective equipment."
"18696020","[Comparison of different speech intelligibility tests in German language (Freiburg speech test vs. Gttingen sentence test and monosyllabic rhyme test)].","BACKGROUND: For assessing a noise-induced hearing loss, the Freiburg speech test (Freiburger Sprachtest) is traditionally used to examine speech recognition in silence. However, for many years this test has been shown to have serious shortcomings. Various modern procedures in German language are available as alternatives.METHODS: The aim of the current study was to compare the Freiburg number test (FBZ) with the Gttingen sentence test (GSa) and the Freiburg monosyllabic test (FBE) with the monosyllabic rhyme test developed by von Wallenberg and Kollmeier (WaKo), all applied in silence. Overall, 31 participants with various degrees of hearing loss were tested in this study. Speech intelligibility was determined with both monosyllabic tests at presentation levels of 60 and 80 dB SPL and for some listeners also at 100 dB SPL. The maximum intelligibility was also determined. In addition, for the combination FBZ and FBE and for the combination FBZ and WaKo, the percentage of hearing loss based on speech audiometry was calculated.RESULTS: The results show that both of the modern speech tests can be used as an alternative to the Freiburg speech test. Altogether the monosyllabic rhyme test leads to higher speech intelligibility than the Freiburg monosyllabic test. Therefore, a reduction of the presentation level by 15 dB is recommended if it is intended to retain the existing tables for calculating the percentage of hearing loss. Reducing the presentation level also has the advantage that measurements at 100 dB SPL are not required anymore. A level of 100 dB SPL is assessed as unpleasant by many listeners."
"20040978","Occupational noise-induced hearing loss in India.","Noise is the insidious of all industrial pollutants, involving every industry and causing severe hearing loss in every country in the world. Exposure to excessive noise is the major avoidable cause of permanent hearing impairment. Worldwide, 16% of the disabling hearing loss in adults is attributed to occupational noise, ranging from 7 to 21% in the various subregions. The estimated cost of noise to developed countries ranges from 0.2 to 2% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is bilateral and symmetrical, usually affecting the higher frequencies (3k, 4k or 6k Hz) and then spreading to the lower frequencies (0.5k, 1k or 2k Hz). Other major health effects are lack of concentration, irritation, fatigue, headache, sleep disturbances, etc. The major industries responsible for excessive noise and exposing workers to hazardous levels of noise are textile, printing, saw mills, mining, etc. Hearing protectors should be used when engineering controls and work practices are not feasible for reducing noise exposure to safe levels. Earmuffs, ear plugs and ear canal caps are the main types of hearing protectors. In India, NIHL has been a compensable disease since 1948. It is only in 1996 that the first case got compensation. Awareness should be created among workers about the harmful effects of noise on hearing and other body systems by implementing compulsory education and training programs. There are very few published studies of NIHL in India. More extensive studies are needed to know the exact prevalence of NIHL among the various industries in India."
"18665008","The effects of superior semicircular canal dehiscence on the labyrinth: does size matter?","BACKGROUND: Superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) is characterized by lack of bony covering of the superior semicircular canal in the inner ear, resulting in a third mobile window with altered functioning of the superior semicircular canal. Vertigo in association with sound and pressure changes often occurs. This study examines the relationship between dehiscence size and frequency of sound-induced vertigo.METHOD: Retrospective review of 22 patients with SSCD, noting the auditory frequency producing the maximal electronystagmographic response.RESULTS: The study found a correlation between dehiscence size and stimulator frequency of r = 0.856, p &lt; 0.001. The larger the dehiscence, the lower the frequency of stimuli required to provoke a vestibular response.CONCLUSION: The relationship found between the superior canal dehiscence size and the stimulator frequency has clinical implications in the diagnosis and management of patients with SSCD."
"18616091","Course of hearing recovery according to frequency in patients with acute acoustic sensorineural hearing loss.","Through pure-tone audiometry, we studied the course of hearing recovery in 24 ears of 20 men (ages 18-48 years) who had acute acoustic sensorineural hearing loss (ASHL). All subjects were members of the Japanese Self-Defense Force. The hearing level in 5 ears returned to normal, the hearing level of 13 ears recovered but was not within the normal range, and the hearing level of 6 ears was unchanged. The time from noise exposure to presentation was longer in patients with unchanged hearing than in other patients. Recovery of hearing was poorest at 4,000 Hz, followed by 8,000 and 2,000 Hz. We concluded that hearing in patients with acute ASHL is likely to return to normal when the hearing level at 4,000 Hz recovers gradually; partial recovery of hearing is expected when the hearing level at 4,000 Hz reaches an early plateau."
"18608533","Hearing status among commercial pilots in a Swedish airline company.","The aim was to study hearing impairment in commercial pilots. A total of 634 male and 30 female pilots (N=664) in a Swedish airline company underwent repeated audiological tests during the period 1974-2005. The last test was used to study hearing impairment. The mean values for the hearing test at 3, 4, and 6 kHz were used for the ear with worse hearing impairment. Data was compared with a general adult Swedish population (n=603) not occupationally exposed to noise. Equivalent noise levels gate to gate (Leq) were measured in the cockpit of different aircraft. Leq was 75-81 dB (A), peak exposures were 105 dB (A) from the cabin call signal. Median values were similar as in the reference group at all ages. There was no association between years of employment, tobacco smoking, and hearing impairment, when adjusted for age and gender by multiple logistic regressions analysis. In conclusion, pilots are exposed to equivalent noise levels below the current Swedish occupational standard of 85 dB (A), with short peak exposures above the standard, and have normal age-matched hearing thresholds."
"18587592","Can Rh antigens be a risk factor in noise-induced hearing loss?","Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is one of the most common occupational problems and is one of the main causes of deafness. Many factors cause NIHL. Individual susceptibility is one of them. Rhesus (Rh) antigens and ABO blood groups can be factors in determining individual susceptibility. We aim to investigate the relationship between the Rh antigens and NIHL. The study was conducted in 438 factory workers who had been exposed to a noise level more than 85 dB for 8 h a day for a period of &gt;/=15 years. The audiologic results and blood groups were obtained from the individual health records of the factory workers. We determined NIHL in 236 (53.9%) workers. Two hundred and nineteen (55.4%) of Rh-positive workers and seventeen (39.5%) of Rh-negative workers have NIHL, and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05), whereas no statistically significant difference was determined between the NIHL and ABO blood groups. In conclusion, we suggest that the people with Rh-positive blood group are more prone to develop NIHL."

"18532285","Assessment of military shooting noise.","The assessment of the impact of noise exposure on the population is a fundamental step in noise abatement. It includes the establishing of an exposure-response relationship and the setting of an impact threshold that specifies the protection level for the population and triggers eventually mitigating measures to reduce noise exposure. In Switzerland, the impact thresholds should be set so that, in the light of current scientific knowledge and experience, noise exposure below these thresholds will not seriously disturb the well-being of the population. For most current noise sources such as roads, railways and airports there already exist impact thresholds as part of the noise abatement legislation. Yet, no impact thresholds for military shooting grounds have been specified so far. Therefore a study was carried out in order to assess the impact of military noise exposure. The research included the calculation of noise exposure of eight military shooting grounds ranging from small infantry shooting ranges to expanded artillery and tank training facilities and a survey at over 1000 residents in the neighbourhood of these installations. Preliminary results suggest that although the responses of the population to military noise are rather dispersed, data should be sufficiently consistent to establish an exposure-response relationship."
"18520580","Pure-tone threshold description of an elderly French screened population.","OBJECTIVES: To describe the distribution of pure-tone hearing thresholds of a Caucasian population living in the south of France aged 70 years and older. To establish age- and sex-adjusted normative hearing thresholds based on results of subjects free of noise and ototoxic drug exposure and to compare them with hearing thresholds of exposed (E) subjects.DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of a longitudinal epidemiologic cohort study.SETTING: Montpellier suburb, south of France.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 778 subjects 70 years old and older were examined. Noise exposure, ototoxic medication use, and medical history were collected. Hearing thresholds were obtained via pure-tone audiometry. After excluding patients with ear-related disease, 659 subjects were further analyzed (270 men and 389 women). Noise or ototoxic medication exposure was found in 364 subjects (E subjects), whereas 295 had no exposure (nonexposed [NE] subjects).METHODS: Median pure-tone thresholds, lower deviation, and upper deviation were calculated for the NE subjects with a statistical method similar to the ISO 7029 norm and were compared with thresholds of E subjects.RESULTS: Hearing thresholds, especially in high frequencies, increased with age more for women than for men. Median thresholds of E subjects were significantly higher than those for the NE sample in men.CONCLUSION: Age- and sex-adjusted hearing thresholds could well be useful in the study of the impact of environmental and genetic factors on hearing loss in the elderly. The next step would be to quantify the impact of noise, ototoxic drug exposure, and genetics using these age- and sex-adjusted thresholds."
"18479630","Occupational noise-induced tinnitus: does it affect workers' quality of life?","OBJECTIVES: This prospective study aimed to investigate the quality of life of workers in a steel factory.METHODS: The study group was composed of 16 male workers with tinnitus and 30 ears. Fifteen male workers without tinnitus and 30 ears were included into the control group. Workers were evaluated by questionnaire, pure-tone audiometry, and the SF-36 Health Survey. In the study group, tinnitus loudness levels (TLLs) were found.RESULTS: In the study group, the domains general mental health and role limitations owing to emotional problems were significantly lower than in the control group. Older age, industrial noise exposure over a long period, higher noise exposure during work, and hearing loss secondary to occupational noise caused workers to experience higher TLLs. Earheadings protected workers more than earplugs, and TLLs were lower. Important factors that affect workers' quality of life are maximum exposed noise levels, daily and total noise exposure time, and exposure to continuous noise. Occupational noise-induced tinnitus mainly causes emotional disability rather than physical disability. Emotionally impaired QOL results may be due to tinnitus-related psychological problems.CONCLUSION: Workers should have knowledge about the hazardous effects of noise. Periodic health checkups and regular seminars have great importance. Workers must be aware of other ototoxic factors, such as medications and noisy music. In the future, researchers should develop a screening method to detect those with a more hereditary affinity to hearing loss."
"18469718","The burdens of age-related and occupational noise-induced hearing loss in the United States.","OBJECTIVES: Aging and noise are generally considered the most common causes of adult hearing loss in developed countries. This study estimates the contributions of aging and occupational noise in the United States.DESIGN: A model of hearing loss burden in American adults was constructed using data from the Census Bureau, from an international standard that predicts age-related and noise-induced hearing loss (ISO-1999), from the American Medical Association method of determining hearing impairment, and from sources estimating the distribution of occupational noise exposure in different age and sex groups.RESULTS: Occupational noise exposure probably accounts for less than 10% of the burden of adult hearing loss in the United States; most of the rest is age-related. Most of the occupational noise burden is attributable to unprotected exposures above 95 dBA, and becomes apparent in middle age, when occupational noise exposure has ceased but age-related threshold shifts are added to prior noise-induced shifts, resulting in clinically significant impairment.CONCLUSIONS: In our current state of knowledge, noise-induced hearing loss is still the most important preventable cause of hearing loss in the United States. The burden of occupational noise-induced hearing loss could probably be reduced by stricter enforcement of existing regulations. Longer lifespans in developed countries and migration of manufacturing jobs to developing countries will continue to reduce the relative contribution of occupational hearing loss in countries like the United States. Preventive interventions for age-related hearing loss, even if only partially effective, could potentially reduce the burden of adult hearing loss more than elimination of occupational noise."
"18468977","Hazards to hearing from combined exposure to toluene and noise in rats.","INTRODUCTION: The main risk of hearing impairment from workplace exposure to organic solvents may stem from the potentiation of effects caused by concomitant noise exposure. The aim of the present study was to identify the main hazards from combined long-term, low-level exposure to noise and aromatic organic solvents, like toluene, in rats.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The rats were exposed to steady-state, wide-band noise (WBN) and 0 ppm, 100 ppm, 200 ppm and 500 ppm toluene for 90 days. Hearing was assessed using Auditory Brain Stem Responses (ABR) and Distortion Product Oto-Acoustic Emissions (DPOAE) eight weeks after exposure. The impact of noise composition on the interaction between solvent and noise exposure was investigated in rats exposed for 10 days either to 0 ppm, 500 ppm, 1000 ppm or 1500 ppm toluene and either WBN or impulse noise. ABR and DPOAE tests were performed before and two weeks after exposure.RESULTS: Long-term exposure of rats to WBN and toluene at 500 ppm or less did not show any increase in hearing impairment, compared to the rats exposed to noise only. Synergistic interaction was demonstrated in short-term exposure to 1500 ppm toluene and both to WBN and impulse noise, but hearing impairment was much larger when following exposure to impulse noise.CONCLUSION: In combined exposure to low-levels of noise and toluene, even a long-term exposure did not reveal a potential hazard of hearing impairment. Synergistic interaction in combined short-term exposure to toluene and noise was noted both with respect to WBN and impulse noise, but the impulse noise was much more disruptive than WBN at the same level of noise exposure. The ototoxicity of organic solvents may primarily be a hazard also to human hearing due to the exacerbation of hearing loss by a possible co-exposure to especially harmful noise, such as impulse noise."
"18463885","Potential efficacy of early treatment of acute acoustic trauma with steroids and piracetam after gunshot noise.","The purpose of this randomized study was to evaluate the early effect of the treatment of acute acoustic trauma (AAT) with steroids and piracetam in a sample of 52 young soldiers who were exposed to intense gunfire noise (G3 rifle). These patients were divided into three groups: (1) group A (20 patients) in which the treatment began within the first hour after the AAT, (2) group B (17 patients) in which the treatment started more than 1 h later and less than 16 h after the AAT and (3) group C (15 patients) in which the treatment began after 24 h or more. One month after the treatment onset, 36 (69%) patients of all the groups showed hearing improvement (complete-partial recovery) in the pure tone audiometry. The greater number of patients who showed complete recovery after AAT was noted in group A (65%) compared to group B (23.5%) and C (13.3%). Moreover, in group A, in the final audiogram, the averaged hearing threshold was statistically better (P &lt; 0.001) than that of groups B and C. In spite of the lack of control group, our data demonstrated the possible effectiveness of the immediate onset of treatment of AAT."
"18462490","Prevalence of high frequency hearing loss consistent with noise exposure among people working with sound systems and general population in Brazil: a cross-sectional study.","BACKGROUND: Music is ever present in our daily lives, establishing a link between humans and the arts through the senses and pleasure. Sound technicians are the link between musicians and audiences or consumers. Recently, general concern has arisen regarding occurrences of hearing loss induced by noise from excessively amplified sound-producing activities within leisure and professional environments. Sound technicians' activities expose them to the risk of hearing loss, and consequently put at risk their quality of life, the quality of the musical product and consumers' hearing. The aim of this study was to measure the prevalence of high frequency hearing loss consistent with noise exposure among sound technicians in Brazil and compare this with a control group without occupational noise exposure.METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study comparing 177 participants in two groups: 82 sound technicians and 95 controls (non-sound technicians). A questionnaire on music listening habits and associated complaints was applied, and data were gathered regarding the professionals' numbers of working hours per day and both groups' hearing complaint and presence of tinnitus. The participants' ear canals were visually inspected using an otoscope. Hearing assessments were performed (tonal and speech audiometry) using a portable digital AD 229 E audiometer funded by FAPESP.RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the sound technicians and controls regarding age and gender. Thus, the study sample was homogenous and would be unlikely to lead to bias in the results. A statistically significant difference in hearing loss was observed between the groups: 50% among the sound technicians and 10.5% among the controls. The difference could be addressed to high sound levels.CONCLUSION: The sound technicians presented a higher prevalence of high frequency hearing loss consistent with noise exposure than did the general population, although the possibility of residual confounding due to unmeasured factors such as socioeconomic status cannot be ruled out."

Our aim was to investigate the usefulness of high-frequency audiometry to evaluate the possibility of a future use of the high frequencies audiometry as an early indicator for noise induced hearing loss. A cross-sectional study was performed involving 204 industrial noise exposed and 100 non-industrial noise-exposed workers. Each subject was tested with both conventional-frequency (0.25-8 kHz) and high-frequency (9-18 kHz) audiometry during the annually health surveillance campaign conducted in two Italian cement factories. As expected, noise exposed workers were found to have significantly higher hearing thresholds (P &lt; 0.05) at both conventional and extended high frequencies. Marked differences were found for EHFA. Moreover, significant differences at EHFA were detected also in the subgroup of noise-exposed workers with normal findings at conventional audiometry. Our finding indicate that the use of the extended high frequency test may represent a useful tool for detecting early changes of hearing impairment and that it could be used in addition to the conventional test to better prevent the progression of noise hearing loss."
"18409666","[Evidence Based Occupational Medicine: ten year experience with audiometric examination in a handicraft company].","This work describes the audiometry threshold assessment of 1000 workers employed in different artisan categories during a period of ten-year noise professional exposure. The hearing loss noise-induced rates were determined by analysing audiometric tests at the beginning of our period of study and after 5 and 10 years of noise exposure. Environmental noise exposures were on average 88 dB(A), but near 90 dB(A) in some work categories. Workers widely used hearing protection devices, nearly at 93%, during the period we studied. The Evidence Based Occupational Medicine should find out points of reference proving the efficiency and effectiveness of occupational physicians: in this case, a positive trend in the reduction of hearing loss rate will be expected to confirm the goodness of prevention practice. Our study suggests that the levels of protection so far accepted are not effective enough in order to reduce the incidence of noise-induced hearing loss in the course of the years: in despite of most accredited predicting models for hearing conservation programs, a significant percentage of workers exposed to industrial noise continues to present a high incidence of hearing loss. The Evidence Based Occupational Medicine suggests that the proposed prevention activities carried out in the described factories were not enough effective."
"18404276","Noise induced hearing loss and other hearing complaints among musicians of symphony orchestras.","OBJECTIVES: An investigation of the hearing status of musicians of professional symphony orchestras. Main questions are: (1) Should musicians be treated as a special group with regard to hearing, noise, and noise related hearing problems (2) Do patterns of hearing damage differ for different instrument types (3) Do OAE have an added value in the diagnosis of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) in musicians.METHODS: 241 professional musicians, aged between 23-64 participated. A brief medical history and the subjective judgment of their hearing and hearing problems were assessed. Musicians were subjected to an extensive audiological test battery, which contained testing of audiometric thresholds, loudness perception, diplacusis, tinnitus, speech perception in noise, and otoacoustic emissions.RESULTS: Most musicians could be categorized as normal hearing, but their audiograms show notches at 6 kHz, a frequency that is associated with NIHL. Musicians often complained about tinnitus and hyperacusis, while diplacusis was generally not reported as a problem. Tinnitus was most often localized utmost left and this could not be related to the instrument. It was usually perceived in high frequency areas, associated with NIHL. In general, musicians scored very well on the speech-in-noise test. The results of the loudness perception test were within normal limits. Otoacoustic emissions were more intense with better pure-tone thresholds, but due to large individual differences it can still not be used as an objective test for early detection of NIHL.CONCLUSIONS: Musicians show more noise induced hearing loss than could be expected on the basis of age and gender. Other indicators, such as complaints and prevalence of tinnitus, complaints about hyperacusis and prevalence of diplacusis suggest that musicians' ears are at risk. Continuing education about the risks of intensive sound exposure to musicians, with the emphasis on the possible development of tinnitus and hyperacusis and the need for good hearing protection is warranted."
"18393354","Extended high-frequency audiometry and noise induced hearing loss in cement workers.","BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that extended high-frequency audiometry (EHFA) might be more sensitive than conventional audiometry in detecting early signs of hearing impairment. However, this technique has not been adequately tested in an occupational environment. We therefore investigated the usefulness of this method in noise-exposed workers.METHODS: We compared conventional frequency audiometry (0.25-8 kHz) and EHFA (9-18 kHz) in 184 noise-exposed and 98 non-noise-exposed workers.RESULTS: Both methods showed significantly higher threshold levels (P &lt; 0.05) in noise-exposed workers for most of the tested frequencies; however, the differences were more marked for EHFA, especially in young exposed workers. Significant differences in the EHF range were detected also in the subgroup of noise-exposed workers with normal findings at conventional audiometry. Stepwise regression analysis showed that in 21- to 40-year-old workers the noise effect was largely predominant at both conventional audiometry and EHFA, whereas in older subjects the noise effect was predominant up to 6 kHz frequency, the effect of age being significantly greater at higher frequencies.CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that EHFA is more sensitive than conventional audiometry in detecting noise induced hearing loss. However, hearing loss in the EHF range seems an age-dependent phenomenon with progression into the lower speech range frequencies with increasing age. These changes seem to be accentuated in the early years by noise exposure, suggesting that EHFA could represent a useful preventive measure in young exposed workers."

This study aims at looking into the consequences of military training on hearing acuity, as it would be useful to confirm the effectiveness of the hearing conservation programme in the Singapore Armed Forces.METHODS: A self-controlled study of 118 Singapore military conscripts was carried out, using questionnaires administered by trained personnel and pure tone audiometric assessments performed for both ears. The questionnaire and audiometry were done at the start of basic military training (BMT), with follow-up audiometry done at the end of BMT and one year into vocational military training (VT).RESULTS: 33 military conscripts were excluded subsequently in latter phases of the study. Of the 85 remaining conscripts, 16.5 percent of the study population were found to have abnormal audiograms at the start of BMT. At the end of the BMT phase, the percentage of enlistees with abnormal audiograms was 9.4 percent. By the end of one year of VT, the percentage of enlistees with abnormal audiograms was still 9.4 percent. Analysis of the differences in number of enlistees with hearing loss was done with the McNemar's test, and was found to be statistically insignificant (p-value equals 0.238).CONCLUSION: The prevalence of 16.5 percent abnormal audiograms at the pre-BMT stage is probably related to unfamiliarity with the audiogram testing and/or &quot;temporary threshold shift&quot; effect. There was no significant difference in the number of enlistees with hearing loss upon enlistment and after one year of military training in this cohort of soldiers."
"18317609","A systematic review of the interventions to promote the wearing of hearing protection.","CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Noise-induced hearing loss can only be prevented by eliminating or lowering noise exposure levels. When the source of the noise cannot be eliminated, workers have to rely on hearing protection equipment. The aim here was to summarize the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to enhance the wearing of hearing protection among workers exposed to noise in the workplace.DATA SOURCE: Studies with random assignment were identified by an electronic search of the medical literature up to 2005. Data were double-entered into the Review Manager software, version 4.2.5.DATA SYNTHESIS: Two studies were found. A computer-based intervention tailored to individual workers risks and lasting 30 minutes was not found to be more effective than a video providing general information for workers. A second randomized controlled trial evaluated the effect of a four-year school-based hearing loss prevention program among schoolchildren working on their parents farms. The intervention group was twice as likely to wear some kind of hearing protection as was the control group (which received only minimal intervention). REVIEWERS CONCLUSIONS: The limited evidence does not show whether tailored interventions are more or less effective than general interventions among workers, 80% of whom already use hearing protection. Long-lasting school-based interventions may increase the use of hearing protection substantially. Better interventions to enhance the use of hearing protection need to be developed and evaluated in order to increase the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss among workers."
"18307091","Iris pigmentation and susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss.","The purpose of this retrospective study is to examine the possible association between iris pigmentation and susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss in 2407 noise-exposed workers. The workers were between 16 to 65 years of age and were exposed to 2 to 42 years of work-related noise. Results demonstrated that dark-eyed workers presented a greater percentage of normal pure-tone thresholds than fair-eyed workers. Fair-eyed workers had threshold averages of 25.1 dB (right ear) and 26.0 dB (left ear) at 3, 4, and 6 kHz, which were significantly worse than workers with dark irises, with threshold averages of 15.8 dB and 17.2 dB in the right and left ear, respectively (p&lt;0.01). Fair-eyed workers with less than 10 years of noise exposure had the same audiometric pattern as the dark-eyed workers exposed for more than 10 years. Workers not exposed to noise did not present significant differences in their audiometric pattern as a function of eye colour. These results suggest that iris pigmentation may be an additional indication of susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss."
"18307090","The risk of tinnitus following occupational noise exposure in workers with hearing loss or normal hearing.","The purpose was to investigate the relationship between noise exposure and tinnitus among workers with normal hearing and hearing loss, respectively. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 752 workers employed at 91 workplaces, that were investigated by means of full work-shift noise levels, questionnaire data, and bilateral pure-tone audiometry. Tinnitus was not associated with the present noise level, the duration of noise exposure, or the cumulative noise exposure if participants had normal hearing. As expected, such trends were demonstrated if participants had a hearing handicap. Based on these data, we will be cautious in ascribing tinnitus to noise exposure in our patients' workplaces if they have a normal audiogram. Furthermore our data indicates no risk of noise-induced tinnitus at exposure levels where no hearing loss would be expected, e.g. as usually encountered in non-industrial workplaces."

Sound pressure levels were measured during a rehearsal, indicating mean levels ranging from 96.4 dB(A) to 106.9 dB(A). Subjects answered questionnaires and underwent audiometry. They attended a lecture in which folders and hearing protection aids were provided; subjects were asked to try using the protectors for 3 months.RESULTS: At the end of the study period, 56.2% reported not liking hearing protection, while 43.7 % accepted such protection. The most common complaints were discomfort with sounds (58.8 %) and tinnitus (47%). 77.1% said that music might cause hearing impairment. A statistically significant difference was observed in the right ear at 4 and 6 kHz and at the left ear in 3, 4 and 6 kHz when median thresholds were compared with those from unexposed controls.CONCLUSION: Although most subjects seemed aware of the risk, few took preventive measures against hearing loss.

Thirty textile workers exposed to high noise 105 dB (A) in a textile factory, and 30 healthy male volunteers in our hospital as a control group were included in the study. In both groups, following audiometric tests, blood samples were obtained. In these blood samples, Malonydialdehyte (MDA), Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase (CAT) levels were investigated. Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS version 11.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago 1L) software program. Mean pure tone audiometric thresholds in workers were significantly higher than in control subjects at frequencies 2,000, 4,000 and 6,000 Hz (p&lt;0.05). Hearing losses were more evident at high frequencies (4-6 kHz) than at low frequencies in worker group. (p&lt;0.05). It was observed that textile workers with longer employment duration had poorer hearing threshoulds and the hearing loss had started on those who had worked for 5-8 yr. While MDA levels were significantly higher in workers than controls (p&lt;0.001), CAT activity was significantly lower (p&lt;0.005). Also, SOD activity was lower in workers but difference was not statistically significant. We observed a significant change in hearing threshold of the textile workers compared with that of the control group. Increase in MDA level and decreases in CAT and SOD activities in textile workers, support the opinion that the noise causes the oxidative stress. The fact that noise both causes hearing loss and increases oxidative stress suggests that there may be a relationship between the oxidative stress and hearing loss. But, further studies are needed in order to verify this opinion."
"18189569","Validation of the auditory hazard assessment algorithm for the human with impulse noise data.","Predicting auditory hazard from intense acoustic impulses, such as weapons fire or airbags, has been an intractable problem. The U.S. Army developed a theoretically based mathematical model of the ear designed to predict such hazards [the Auditory Hazard Assessment Algorithm for the Human (AHAAH)]. To validate it as a predictor of hazard, data from the literature (wave forms and changes in hearing sensitivity) were processed with the model in order to predict the onset of unacceptable threshold shift (25 dB or more) in the 95th percentile human ear. For comparison, alternate standards MIL-STD-1747D and A-weighted energy were also used to compute hazards for the same data. The primary dataset was that of the US Army's &quot;Albuquerque studies&quot; (53 different cases) and other impulses from the literature (19 additional predictions). The AHAAH model predicted correctly in over 95% of the cases, the MIL-STD-1474D was correct in 42% of the cases, and A-weighted energy was correct in 25% of the cases. Errors for all methods tended to be in the direction of overprediction of hazard. In addition to greatly increased accuracy, the AHAAH model also has the advantage of being theoretically based and including novel diagnostic features."
"18165194","Relationship between styrene exposure and hearing loss: review of human studies.","Styrene is an aromatic solvent belonging to the alkylbenzene family. Occupational exposure to styrene occurs mainly in the manufacturing of fiberglass-reinforced polyester products, e.g. reinforced plastics and composites. Since 1988, nine studies have been published on the relationship between occupational exposure to styrene and hearing loss. All studies were the cross-sectional epidemiological studies or clinical studies from occupational health clinics. A total of more than 1000 workers exposed to styrene, both with and without concurrent noise exposure, were examined using different outcome measures for hearing loss. Exposure assessment was usually based on styrene measurements in the breathing zone during several hours of one working day. Some of the studies employed also the biological monitoring of styrene exposure based on determination of its urinary metabolites. The current exposures to styrene varied between 2 and 35 ppm. In some studies, lifetime exposure was calculated using company records and questionnaire data. The current exposure to noise was estimated by noise dosimetry or standard noise measurements. Lifetime noise exposure was assessed using questionnaire data and occupational noise estimates. In many studies, noise-exposed groups were used as controls together with the unexposed workers. Of the nine studies, seven show some effects on the auditory system that were associated with styrene-alone exposure. These effects are examined using different outcome measures such as pure tone audiometry, high frequency hearing loss, and central hearing tests. In some studies, an increased risk for hearing loss was associated with exposure estimates."
"20024522","Occupation and the risk of hearing impairment--results from the Nord-Trndelag study on hearing loss.","OBJECTIVES: We studied the effect of occupation on hearing and if it remained after adjustment for noise exposure, education, income, and other risk factors.METHODS: Audiometry and a questionnaire concerning exposure was administered to a general adult population sample in Norway (N=49,948). Information on occupation, education, and income was obtained from population census registers.RESULTS: Occupation had marked effects on hearing loss. Occupation explained 2-3% of the variance in hearing loss among men &gt; or =45 years in addition to the hearing loss due to age (10-19%). Occupation explained &lt; or =1% of hearing loss among women of all ages and young men. Controlling for self-reported occupational noise exposure reduced the occupational effect by 20-40% in men &gt; or =45 years. Controlling for leisure-time noise, ear infections, and head injuries did not change the effect of occupation, which was slightly reduced after controlling for education and income. The most elevated hearing thresholds in men were observed among: wood workers; miners; linemen and cable jointers; construction carpenters and workers; seamen; and workshop mechanics.CONCLUSIONS: There was a moderate association between occupation and hearing loss. Unbiased estimates of occupational hearing loss may help identify high-risk occupations, for which interventions are needed, and identify individuals with hearing loss."
"20015738","Test-retest tinnitus characteristics in patients with noise-induced hearing loss.","PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to examine the test-retest value of tinnitus pitch and loudness in patients with tinnitus and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study sample consisted of 30 patients of mean age 35 +/- 6.7 years with long-standing tinnitus and hearing loss due to exposure to noise during military service. Ten patients had unilateral tinnitus, and 20 had bilateral tinnitus. All presented with a typical NIHL audiogram on the affected side(s). None of the patients was receiving drug therapy.RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in tinnitus pitch or loudness between the 2 tests for the whole group and separately in patients with unilateral or bilateral tinnitus.CONCLUSION: Subjective testing of pitch and loudness of tinnitus secondary to NIHL is accurate and reproducible, making it a valuable tool for diagnosis and follow-up. The lack of differences between patients with unilateral or bilateral tinnitus indicates that both types may be managed in a similar manner."
"19944139","Effects of ear-canal pressurization on middle-ear bone- and air-conduction responses.","In extremely loud noise environments, it is important to not only protect one's hearing against noise transmitted through the air-conduction (AC) pathway, but also through the bone-conduction (BC) pathways. Much of the energy transmitted through the BC pathways is concentrated in the mid-frequency range around 1.5-2 kHz, which is likely due to the structural resonance of the middle ear. One potential approach for mitigating this mid-frequency BC noise transmission is to introduce a positive or negative static pressure in the ear canal, which is known to reduce BC as well as AC hearing sensitivity. In the present study, middle-ear ossicular velocities at the umbo and stapes were measured using human cadaver temporal bones in response to both BC and AC excitations, while static air pressures of +/-400 mm H(2)O were applied in the ear canal. For the maximum negative pressure of -400 mm H(2)O, mean BC stapes-velocity reductions of about 5-8 dB were observed in the frequency range from 0.8 to 2.5 kHz, with a peak reduction of 8.6(+/-4.7)dB at 1.6 kHz. Finite-element analysis indicates that the peak BC-response reduction tends to be in the mid-frequency range because the middle-ear BC resonance, which is typically around 1.5-2 kHz, is suppressed by the pressure-induced stiffening of the middle-ear structure. The measured data also show that the BC responses are reduced more for negative static pressures than for positive static pressures. This may be attributable to a difference in the distribution of the stiffening among the middle-ear components depending on the polarity of the static pressure. The characteristics of the BC-response reductions are found to be largely consistent with the available psychoacoustic data, and are therefore indicative of the relative importance of the middle-ear mechanism in BC hearing."
"19925346","The effect of tightened hearing protection regulations on military noise-induced tinnitus.","The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of tightened hearing protection regulations on tinnitus in the Finnish Defence Forces. The initial study group comprised 252 officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs), of which 229 were included in the final study group. Subjective symptoms of tinnitus and audiometric test results for these officers and NCOs examined before retirement, from 1984 to 1986 (Period I), and 2003 to 2005 (Period II), were reviewed. Changes in tinnitus reports between the two time periods, during which regulations had been revised, were investigated. Prevalence of tinnitus showed a decline both in officers (from 68% to 63%) and in NCOs (from 76% to 72%) between the two study periods, in accordance with tightened hearing protection regulations. The Cox regression analysis showed a significantly decreased hazard ratio for constant or disturbing tinnitus for Period II. Tinnitus prevalence, especially constant or disturbing tinnitus, in the Finnish Defence Forces was diminished by tightened hearing protection regulations. Tinnitus might be more persistent than hearing loss and does not necessarily improve in direct relation to hearing loss after protective measures."
"19914970","Hearing symptoms and audiometry in professional divers and offshore workers.","AIMS: The aims are to compare hearing loss between professional divers and offshore workers and to study whether hearing loss symptoms reflected physical disorder. A secondary objective was to study total threshold shift assessment as a method of detecting noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).METHODS: Participants (151 divers and 120 offshore workers) completed a questionnaire for symptoms and screening audiometry. Audiograms were assessed for total threshold shift at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 kHz and the prevalence of referral (within population 5th centile) or warning levels (within population 20th centile) of hearing loss. Audiograms were assessed for an NIHL pattern at four levels by two occupational physicians.RESULTS: Hearing loss symptoms were commoner in divers at all levels of hearing loss regardless of differences between groups on audiometry. Hearing loss in offshore workers was within the population age-adjusted norm. Thirteen per cent of divers were within the 5th percentile for threshold shift for the population norm in contrast to 4% of offshore workers and this was predominantly left sided (OR 3.16, 95% CI 1.13-8.93). This difference was lost after adjustment for history of regular exposure to explosion or gunfire. Divers were more likely to have a pattern of severe NIHL on the left (OR 4.61, 95% CI 1.39-15.39, P &lt; 0.05). Approximately 50% of participants with severe NIHL did not have a referral level of hearing loss.CONCLUSIONS: Divers suffer more NIHL than a control population. Current guidance on the assessment of total threshold shift for the detection of significant NIHL was inadequate in the sample studied."

DNA samples were collected from the 10% most susceptible and the 10% most resistant individuals. Four SNPs in the introns of SOD1 were genotyped and their effects and interactions with noise exposure were analyzed.RESULTS: Genotype AA of rs2070424 conferred protection against NIHL (adjusted OR = 0.45, p = 0.005), while GG of rs10432782 was a risk genotype (adjusted OR = 1.88, p = 0.026). One protective haplotype TATG (OR = 0.56, p = 0.003) and two risk haplotypes, CATG and TGGA (OR = 1.58, 28.75 and p = 0.017, &lt;0.001, respectively) were identified. Significant interactions between SOD1 SNPs and noise levels were found. Further analysis of effects of SOD1 SNPs found that those carrying GG genotype of rs10432782 had significantly higher SOD1 activity (p = 0.022), but a significantly lower level of malondialdehyde in plasma, compared with TT carriers (p = 0.007)."

In the NIHL group, potentials PI, PIII and/or PV were not present in a small number of the individuals; we observed a statistically significant increase in PI, PIII and PV absolute latencies, (LIP) LIP I-III interpeak latencies, bilaterally and LIP I-V in the left ear.CONCLUSION: in the NIHL group, besides sensorial injury, changes in BEAP latencies suggest an early functional injury of the first auditory pathway afferent neuron."
"19887518","Cigarette smoking and occupational noise-induced hearing loss.","BACKGROUND: Noise is the most common occupational hazard. Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a known occupational disease. The economic costs of NIHL have been estimated to be billions of dollars. Besides, cigarette smoking is a common habit worldwide.METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we surveyed the effect of smoking on NIHL in 504 workers in a large wagon manufacturing company exposed to noise &gt;85 dBA. All required data were obtained using direct interview and questionnaires. To determine noise exposure level, we used industrial hygienist's reports of sound level measurements. A qualified audiologist assessed hearing status using standardized audiometric examination.RESULTS: We concluded that the frequency of hearing loss in smokers was higher than non-smokers [based on Model 1: odds ratio (OR) = 9.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 5.74-15.22 and P-value &lt; 0.001; and based on Model 2: OR = 9.06, 95% CI = 5.93-13.84 and P-value &lt; 0.001].

The SOD2 typing was extended with polymerase chain reaction and screened with single-strand conformation polymorphism. The associations of genetic polymorphisms with noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) were analyzed.RESULTS: The allele frequencies of T and G in the population of this study were 0.868 and 0.132, respectively. In 200 screened participants, individuals with T/G genotype were significantly more vulnerable to noise (adjusted odds ratio, 6.222; 95% confidence interval, 1.498-25.855) than the wild type (ie, T/T) by logistic regressions.CONCLUSIONS: The distributions of SOD2 genetic polymorphisms for Asians are different from those reported on Europeans. Individuals with T/G genotype were more vulnerable to noise. This single nucleotide polymorphism is worthy of more studies for the application to NIHL monitoring."
"19848096","[Noise-induced hearing loss: are health service surveillance programs always effective?].","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate noise-induced hearing loss in a group of workers at a steel engineering works over a 20 year period (1979-1999).METHODS: A total of 2431 audiometric tests were performed in 708 workers (in 1979, 1984, 1989, 1994 and 1999). Audiometric tests were classified so that hearing loss could be assessed over time. Additionally, personal noise exposure was measured for each worker (average, 85 dB(A) in tests carried out in 1992, 1996 and 1999).RESULTS: Over 5 years of noise exposure, mean cumulative incidence of noise-induced hearing loss was 8,2%. Over 10 years ofexposure (1979-89 or 1984-94 or 1989-99), the mean incidence was 15,3%. This percentage increased to 22,9% and 25,7% when the exposure lasted 15 or 20 years respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The considerable incidence of noise-induced hearing loss within the wide group of steel workers examined greatly exceeds the expected incidence related to the occupational exposure limits. The Evidence Based Occupational Medicine suggests that our health surveillance was not effective enough."
"19821342","Interventions to promote the wearing of hearing protection.","BACKGROUND: This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 2, 2006. The original review was republished in Issue 2, 2009 with feedback incorporated.Noise induced hearing loss can be prevented by eliminating or lowering noise exposure levels. Where the source of the noise cannot be eliminated, workers have to rely on hearing protection equipment. Several trials have been conducted to study the effectiveness of interventions to influence the wearing of hearing protection.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to enhance the wearing of hearing protection among persons regularly exposed to high noise levels.SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 4 February 2009.SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies if they had a randomised design, if they were among noise exposed (&gt; 80 dB(A)) persons, if they included an intervention to promote the wearing of hearing protection (compared to another intervention or no intervention), and if the outcome measured was the amount of use of hearing protection or a proxy measure thereof.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors selected relevant trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data.MAIN RESULTS: Six studies, involving 3917 participants, were included.A computer-based intervention lasting 30 minutes, tailored to the risk of an individual worker, was not found to be more effective than a video providing general information among workers, around 80% of whom already used hearing protection.A four year school-based hearing loss prevention programme found that the intervention group was twice as likely to wear some kind of hearing protection as the control group that received baseline hearing test and two additional tests at years two and three.We conducted two meta-analyses for the comparisons 'tailored strategy (the use of communication or other types of interventions that are specific to an individual or a group and aim to change behaviour) versus non-tailored strategy' and 'tailored strategy versus a commercial video on the use of hearing protection' to look at mean percentage use of hearing protective devices (HPDs), that showed improvement in the mean use of HPDs for the tailored group.Tailored education showed an improvement in HPD use of 8.3% versus targeted education (6.1%).AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence found in this review shows that some interventions improve the mean use of hearing protection devices compared to non-intervention. Future trials should have standard outcomes and interventions to allow the combining of results in meta-analysis."
"19817237","Hearing loss in civilian airline and helicopter pilots compared to air traffic control personnel.","INTRODUCTION: In order to investigate possible hearing loss as a consequence of aviation noise, a comparative analysis of audiometric data from Norwegian Air Traffic Control (ATC) personnel, airline (fixed-wing) pilots, and helicopter pilots was performed. The results may be of use in giving advice regarding preventive measures.METHODS: Male ATC, airline, and helicopter pilots were selected randomly from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) medical files. There were 182 subjects included in the study: 50, 81, and 51 subjects for ATC, helicopter, and airline pilots, respectively. Two audiograms with a 2-3-yr interval were analyzed for each individual. Age correction was performed using data from ISO 7129. Threshold changes per year for the frequencies 3, 4, and 6 kHz were examined in particular after age correction.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: For all three groups, mean hearing threshold levels were above (worse than) ISO 7129 predictions for most frequencies. As expected, hearing thresholds increased with age in the group as a whole. Looking at the 3-, 4-, and 6-kHz frequencies in particular, all groups had small but highly significant increases in hearing thresholds at 4 kHz between the first and second audiogram.CONCLUSIONS: The mean hearing thresholds for this group of aviation personnel are higher than International Standard ISO-7129 would predict according to age. Highly significant changes in hearing threshold after age correction, indicating possible noise-induced hearing loss, were found in all groups at 4 kHz. The fact that helicopter pilots had similar hearing loss to their other aviation colleagues indicates that current hearing protection for these pilots is effective in counteracting the increased noise levels in helicopters."
"19793694","[Detection of ototoxic effect of cisplatin with otoacoustic emission in testicular cancer patients].","The aim of the research was to detect the acute and long-term ototoxic effect of cisplatin in testicular cancer patients, using OAE (otoacoustic emission), a highly sensitive new objective method, for detecting medication-related hearing loss. Secondary objective was to evaluate the risk factors that contribute to hearing loss. In the study for acute hearing loss ten males with different histological types of testicular germ cell tumor were examined with TOAE (transiently evoked otoacoustic emission), before the 1st and after the 5th day of their 1st cycle of cytostatic therapy. Patients received 100 mg/m 2 cisplatin per cycle (20 mg/m 2 for five days). Ten age-matched healthy volunteers of good hearing and without treatment were also examined with the same method. Wilcoxon and paired t-tests were used for statistical evaluation. In this acute phase study no differences were found either in otological physiological examination, in conventional audiometry, or in tympanometry. There were no statistically significant differences in amplitude either before and after therapy, or between patient and control group. No patient complained of hearing loss or tinnitus. In the long-term hearing loss study 223 cured patients were assessed by DPOAE (distorsion product otoacoustic emission). Patients received 100 mg/m 2 cisplatin per cycle, in EP, BEP, VeIP, VIP or VPB regimens. The control group consisted of 40 testicular cancer patients without chemotherapy. A detailed medical history of the patient and his family evaluated audiological risk factors and hearing complaints. Before DPOAE, otoscopic examination and tympanometry tests were used to exclude any conductive component. DPOAE was measured in eight frequencies from 750 to 8,000 Hz. Paired t-test, Mann-Whitney test and stepwise discriminant analysis were used for statistical evaluation. Symptomatic ototoxicity was observed in 20% of the patients. In patients receiving &lt; or =300 mg/m 2 cisplatin, no amplitude changes were detected. Beyond this dose, hearing impairment proved to be dose-dependent. Contrary to the literature, not only high frequencies were affected. In patients receiving &gt; or =400 mg/m 2 , our method could also detect significant hearing impairment at lower frequencies that are important for speech perception (1000-3000 Hz). The lowest amplitudes were detected in those patients who had symptomatic ototoxicity. The only statistically significant risk factors were the cumulative dose of cisplatin and age; neither smoking nor previous noise exposure proved to be risk factors. As the life expectancy of testicular cancer patients matches in most cases the life expectancy of healthy males, studying long-term side effects is of great importance. OAE is a fast, noninvasive and reliable method in detecting ototoxicity in testicular cancer patients. Cisplatin dose regimens should be reduced to the minimum required for cure, based on a risk-adapted treatment."

Jobs at the factory were divided into three different levels of solvent exposure. Hearing status was assessed with a test battery including pure-tone hearing thresholds (0.5-8 kHz), high-frequency hearing thresholds (12 and 16 kHz), and dichotic listening measured through dichotic digits test. Multiple linear regression models were created to explore possible association between solvent exposure and each of the hearing outcomes.RESULTS: Significant associations between solvent exposure and the three hearing outcomes were found. Covariates such as age, gender, race, and ethnicity were also significantly associated with the studied hearing outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: Occupational exposure to solvents may induce both peripheral and central auditory dysfunction. The dichotic digits test seems as a sensible tool to detect central auditory dysfunction associated with solvent exposure. Hearing loss prevention programs may use this tool to monitor hearing in solvent-exposed workers."
"19766602","Follow-up of latency and threshold shifts of auditory brainstem responses after single and interrupted acoustic trauma in guinea pig.","Thresholds of auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) are widely used to estimate the level of noise-induced hearing loss or the level of acquired resistance to acoustic trauma after repeated exposures, i.e., the &quot;toughening&quot; effect. Less is known about ABR latencies and their relation to threshold changes. Guinea pigs were exposed to a traumatic pure tone at 5 kHz, 120 dB SPL, as either single (2 h, 4 h) or repeated (1 h every 48 h, four times) sessions. Thresholds and latencies of ABRs were monitored up to 45 days following the acoustic trauma. We show that latencies are prolonged in the case of large temporary threshold shifts observed in the days following trauma. The latency shift decreases after several repeated exposures, then stabilizes, similar to thresholds, suggesting that the &quot;toughening&quot; effect also applies to latencies. Permanent latency shift is usually very small compared to the permanent threshold shift. This effect could produce a recovery in the ability to process auditory information through the precise timing of neuronal events. Our study indicates that when estimated at suprathreshold stimulation level (70 dB SPL), latency provides complementary information to the sole threshold."

The study included 248 workers exposed to noise, through non-probability convenient sampling technique. Equivalent sound pressure level Leq was measured with the help of a Class-1 type digital sound level meter. Hearing status of the workers was assessed through questionnaire and clinical tests (WHISPER, RINNE'S and WEBER).RESULT: Results showed that noise level was in range of 88.4-104 dB(A). The questionnaire results showed that: (i) 92.7% of the workers were aware that high noise level cause speech interference. (ii) 57.2% were unaware about the effect of noise on health. (iii) 54.8% used ear protection devices. (iv) 22.5% did not respond well to whisper test while 16.9% were found to have defective hearing on the basis of Rinne's test and 17.4% through Weber's test. It was observed that hearing loss was significantly associated with working experience of more than 10 years (25%) and overtime (28.8%).CONCLUSION: The results of study establish the fact that noise level is more than acceptable limit of 85 dB(A) for 8 hours exposure stipulated by OSHA.There is an immediate need to develop and implement noise regulations in Pakistan."

Based on the average of the frequencies 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz, approximately 1% of the general UK population aged 18-80 years have an asymmetry of 15 dB or more. The prevalence is greater in older than in younger people.CONCLUSIONS: Inter-aural threshold differences greater than attributable to measurement error are not uncommon in the adult population, even after screening for conductive hearing loss and substantial noise exposure. They are typically of unknown origin."

To evaluate the work environment, we observed the entire setting, aiming at checking sound intensities in an eighth frequency filter.RESULTS: We carried out 192 hearing threshold evaluations after an occupational anamnesis. Concerning NIHL, we noticed that 49% of the audiometry results presented hearing deterioration in the acute frequencies. We studied the mean values and standard deviations for frequencies over 3,000Hz, in all workers, and we observed that the highest average values were in the frequency of 6,000Hz.

Glutathione is an important cellular antioxidant that limits cell damage by ROS. We aimed to determine the effect of genetic polymorphisms of glutathione S-transferase (GST) T1, GSTM1, and GSTP1, on temporary threshold shift (TTS) in 58 noise-exposed male workers from a steel factory. The pre-shift hearing impairment at high frequency (HF, average of 3, 4, and 6kHz) was 30.7dB HL (S.D.=19.3). The amount of daily noise exposure was 83.0dBA (S.D.=5.0). Noise-induced TTS at HF by pure-tone audiometry (PTA) was related to the daily noise exposure (p&lt;0.05). Based on combinatory analysis, we found that individuals carrying all genotypes with GSTT1 null, GSTM1 null, and GSTP1 Ile(105)/Ile(105) were more susceptible to NIHL. These results suggest that pre-shift hearing impairment and daily noise exposure had impacts on TTS at HF by PTA. In addition, GST genetic polymorphisms may modify the susceptibility to noise-induced TTS."

An extensive history of occupational noise exposure, participation in noisy hobbies, and firearm usage was used to evaluate consistency of the notch classifications with the history of noise exposure.RESULTS: The prevalence of notched audiograms varied greatly by definition (31.7, 25.9, 47.2, and 11.7% for methods 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). In this cohort, a history of noise exposure was common (56.2% for occupational noise, 71.7% for noisy hobbies, 13.4% for firearms, and 81.2% for any of these three sources). Among participants with a notched audiogram, almost one-third did not have a history of occupational noise exposure (31.4, 33.0, 32.5, and 28.1% for methods 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively), and approximately 11% did not have a history of exposure to any of the three sources of noise (11.5, 13.6, 10.3, and 7.6%). Discordance was greater in women than in men.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that there is a poor agreement across existing algorithms for audiometric notches. In addition, notches can occur in the absence of a positive noise history. In the absence of an objective consensus definition of a notched audiogram and in light of the degree of discordance in women between noise history and notches by each of these algorithms, researchers should be cautious about classifying noise-induced hearing loss by notched audiograms."
"19597738","The effect of active sonar for the protection of moored and anchored warships on the human hearing.","This study wants to show the effects of active middle frequency sonar on a selected group of Italian Navy divers. Ten male divers with normal hearing were exposed to active sonar of the Italian Navy for more than 100 exposures, each of at least 1-h duration, in the course of 6 months. Before, at the end, and six months after the end of noise exposure, we performed pure-tone audiometry, Carhart test, Peyser test, thresholds of discomfort test (TDT), tympanometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), and auditory brainstem response (ABR). At the end of the noise exposure, the audiological tests showed a worsening of the mean air and bone audiometric thresholds at the 2,000 (1/10), 4,000 (7/10), and 8,000 Hz (6/10); a fail status of the TEOAE and DPOAE, which were previously present, in all the divers; temporary threshold shift, at the Peyser test, in 9/10 divers; discomfort for pulse tone presented at the TDT test, in all the divers; no post exposure significant differences at the Carhart and ABR tests, in any of the divers. Six months after the end of noise exposure, all the divers presented a complete recovery of their audio-vestibular functions. Our results show the temporary negative effects of repeated and lasting exposure to active sonar (Hull MF) on the divers; the last control demonstrate the absence of permanent noise-induced hearing loss in divers exposed to active sonar."

Test results were categorized as defined by Merluzzi. Individuals complaining of tinnitus answered the adapted and validated Brazilian Portuguese version of the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory. A generalized linear model was adjusted for binomial data to test the interaction between these factors.RESULTS: Over 60% of the ears analyzed had hearing loss, while more than 46% of them had tinnitus. Tinnitus prevalence and risk rates increased as pure tone audiometry results got worse. The association between both, considering all hearing loss degrees, was statistically significant.CONCLUSION: The results point to a statistical association between hearing loss and tinnitus; the greater the hearing loss, the greater the discomfort introduced by tinnitus."
"19580230","[Hearing damage as a consequence of firefighters' professional exposure to noise].","The aim of the study was to find out whether firefighters' professional exposure to the noise of sirens, motor water pumps and transportation by heavy vehicles causes biauricular hearing impairment. Furthermore, on the basis of the results the aim was to find out whether it is necessary to launch a hearing preservation program and additional health protection measures for this specific working population. The method of physical examination and audiometry was used. Thirty-four professional firefighters from Opatija and 30 workers of Rijeka Promet employed at the town parking lots underwent audiometry on a Sibelmed AC 50 device and then analyzed. The results of biauricular audiometry showed significant differences in hearing damage between the firefighters and Rijeka Promet employees at higher frequencies where hearing damage begins, i.e. at 4 kHz and 8 kHz (P &lt; 0.05). The firefighters' maximal hearing loss of 30.58 +/- 24.66 dB for the right ear at 4 kHz and of 28.52 +/- 24.66 dB for the right ear at 8 kHz were higher than the hearing loss of the parking lot employees with maximal hearing loss of 17.00 +/- 13.10 dB at 4 kHz and of 16.33 +/- 13.89 dB at 8 kHz. The results of left ear audiometry were very close to those of right ear in both groups of subjects. The linear regression analysis yielded almost identical positive correlation between the time spent at the job and hearing damage, with correlation factor r = +.55 for the right and left ear at 4 kHz. The noise was measured at the Opatija Fire Station. Several measurements were performed: on the premises where firefighters are exposed to so-called communal noise, measurements at 2 m of the fire truck when sirens are sounded, noise measurements in driver's cab when sirens are sounded, and the noise made by motor water pump used in firefighting. Also, measurements were performed on the spot, i.e. at the working place of parking lot employees in the center of Rijeka where they stay most of the time, and on the street by the parking lot. It may be concluded that noise-induced hearing damage in firefighters is a major problem in this working population, their physical and mental condition being very good, which is to be expected of the groups of operatives on whom the lives of &quot;ordinary&quot; people often depend. Hearing damage is the only weak point of firefighters, although fairly mild to moderate at higher frequencies, so medical experts in cooperation with their chiefs should persuade them to wear hearing protection, which could be discomforting in firefighting operations. Firemen are employed mainly at a young age when their hearing is normal. A parallel may be drawn with the military. Professional soldiers who are physically perfectly fit, at periodical medical examinations are often assessed as &quot;limited service&quot; due to hearing damage, although their hearing was good when they started the career. Hearing in the young population is generally good, in Primorje-Gorski Kotar County the average hearing level is 10 dB at all routine frequencies on audiometry, so hearing damage is not among illnesses that might cause difficulties to young recruits. To conclude, to preserve good hearing in both young and experienced firefighters, the Hearing Preservation Program should be more strictly implemented in the Primorje-Gorski Kotar County."

"19570944","Determinants of use of hearing protection devices in Canadian lumber mill workers.","BACKGROUND: In a cohort study of lumber mill workers' exposure to noise and incidence of heart disease, initial noise estimates were likely overestimated because they did not account for reductions afforded by the use of hearing protection. As such information was seldom available for individual workers, modeling was necessary to predict hearing protection use and derive adjusted noise measures.OBJECTIVE: To develop a multilevel model of the likelihood of use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) for British Columbia (Canada) lumber mill workers.METHOD: The study population included 13,147 workers in 14 sawmills for whom we had information on HPD use. Subjects self-reported their use of hearing protectors during routine hearing tests over their work history period. Separate multilevel logistic regression models with increasing complexity were developed for a subcohort of workers with complete information (n = 1493) and for a subcohort comprised subjects with hearing tests coinciding with their jobs (n = 10 203). The models included random intercepts for worker and for sawmill.RESULTS: HPD use was associated in both subcohorts with factors such as noise exposure and age. We also showed that specific jobs (such as sawfiling) and departments (planer, in particular) were strongly associated with the use of HPDs. The model illustrates the quantitative importance of including a hierarchical structure which allows for explaining potential sources of outcome variability.CONCLUSIONS: We developed a hierarchical model to predict hearing protection use to enable correction of exposure assessments for use in retrospective epidemiological studies. We showed that this was feasible even in the absence of complete determinant information."

This is due to increase in mechanization in industries, transportation as well as home appliances produce high level of noise. Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL) is common health complaint found in industrial workers. The present research work reveals the NIHL problem in workers related to saw mill and printing press in Akluj town, Solapur district of Maharashatra state. For the present study measurement of noise levels are done in saw mills and printing presses. The standard noise level value is calculated in respective locations. Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL) among the workers is measured by an Audiometer. 420 workers, viz. 250 from ten saw mills and 170 from ten printing presses respectively were investigated to find out NIHL. The average noise levels in printing press and saw mill are 90.2 dB and 79.3 dB respectively. Whereas standard noise level (Leq) in above locations are 101.4 dB and 98.7 dB respectively. The average NIHL are found in 28% saw mill workers and 13% in printing press workers. It is reported that medicine treatments are not very useful for curing NIHL. Today's available tool which prevents NIHL is ear plugs and ear muffs, which are suitable for preventing NIHL problems in industrial workers."
"19534848","Evaluation of the increased accident risk from workplace noise.","Directive 2003/10/EC sets the requirement for evaluating the effect of noise on accident risk. Accident risk is elevated for workers with a hearing handicap because of their reduced speech intelligibility and reduced capability to perceive the direction of incoming sound. An audiogram is not a good method for the evaluation of these functions. To reduce accident risk, organisational and personal solutions are needed. For both methods, efficiency must be evaluated through proper risk assessment. Because practical guidelines are not available, this paper presents principles for accident risk evaluation techniques."

There were significant effects of age on NIPTS but no significant gender- or ear- differences in terms of NIPTS. The NIPTS at 2,000 Hz was found to be significantly greater than NIPTS at frequencies 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz, 4,000 Hz, and 8,000 Hz.

"19409969","Effects of hearing aid fitting on the perceptual characteristics of tinnitus.","Restoration of auditory input through the use of hearing aids has been proposed as a potentially important means of altering tinnitus among those tinnitus sufferers who experience significant sensorineural hearing loss. In animal models of neural plasticity induced by noise trauma, high-frequency stimulation in deafferented regions of the auditory spectrum has been shown to modulate cortical reorganization after hearing loss, a result which suggests that the neural basis of tinnitus is subject to interference by acoustic stimulation. This study drew on deafferentation models to investigate the effect of hearing aids on the psychoacoustic properties of the tinnitus sensation, using both conventional amplification and high-bandwidth amplification regimes. The tinnitus percept was affected only weakly in the conventional amplification group, and was not at all affected in the high-bandwidth group. The changes observed under conventional, low-to-medium frequency amplification may indicate that the perceptual characteristics of tinnitus depend on the pattern of sensory inputs - notably a contrast in activity between adjacent central auditory regions of more and less afferent activity - while the absence of modifications in the high-bandwidth amplification group suggests limit on the tractability of the tinnitus percept. This limit to the malleability of the tinnitus percept may arise from either the extent of hearing deficits or the duration and robustness of the neuroplastic changes that originally give rise to tinnitus."

"19344615","Exploiting otoacoustic emission testing to identify clinical and subclinical inner ear barotrauma in divers: potential risk factor for sensorineural hearing loss.","INTRODUCTION: Divers may sustain subclinical inner ear barotrauma (IEBT) that is not identified on pure-tone audiometry (PTA) but is potentially an important contributor to chronic sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Otoacoustic emission (OAE) testing, which identifies transient emission shifts (TESs) stemming from noise-induced inner ear injury, may be a more sensitive measure than PTA. Recognizing the salubrious health implications in mitigating the incidence and severity of SNHL in divers with earlier detection, we performed a pilot study investigating the potential of OAEs to identify clinical and subclinical IEBT (defined as a TES without an accompanying transient threshold shift) in divers subject to a provocative repetitive diving protocol.METHODS: Eight US Navy-trained male divers participated in a repetitive diving protocol encompassing up to a maximum of 10 weeks of diving. All subjects received an otoscopic examination, tympanometry, and OAE testing on both ears prior to and immediately after each dive. Audiometry was evaluated prior to and after each week of repetitive diving.RESULTS: There were 212 data pairs for comparison in the OAE testing. The average group wideband transient-evoked OAE shift was -1.24 dB. Only 25 significant threshold shifts were identified in over 1000 comparisons via audiometry.CONCLUSIONS: OAE testing identified significant TES in a provocative repetitive diving protocol, supporting the assertion that both clinical and subclinical IEBT may contribute to chronic SNHL in divers. Exploiting this technology as an integral component of diving medical surveillance may identify those at risk for subsequent IEBT and hearing loss, facilitating opportunities for interventions to mitigate its severity or circumvent its development."

"19266930","Noise induced hearing loss of forest workers in Turkey.","In this study, a total number of 114 workers who were in 3 different groups in terms of age and work underwent audiometric analysis. In order to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference between the hearing loss levels of the workers who were included in the study, variance analysis was applied with the help of the data obtained as a result of the evaluation. Correlation and regression analysis were applied in order to determine the relations between hearing loss and their age and their time of work. As a result of the variance analysis, statistically significant differences were found at 500, 2000 and 4000 Hz frequencies. The most specific difference was observed among chainsaw machine operators at 4000 Hz frequency, which was determined by the variance analysis. As a result of the correlation analysis, significant relations were found between time of work and hearing loss in 0.01 confidence level and between age and hearing loss in 0.05 confidence level. Forest workers using chainsaw machines should be informed, they should wear or use protective materials and less noising chainsaw machines should be used if possible and workers should undergo audiometric tests when they start work and once a year."
"19265247","The hearing conservation amendment: 25 years later.","It has been twenty-five years since the final version of the Hearing Conservation Amendment was issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the U.S. Department of Labor. Since that time, some things have changed and others have stayed exactly the same. Certainly the noise-exposed workforce is more knowledgeable about the hazards of noise, and the use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) has greatly increased. There have been significant strides in the technology for measuring noise and for protecting hearing through HPDs. But there is considerable room for improvement. Some of the noise regulation's provisions are embarrassingly outdated, some are in dire need of improvement, and others, such as the requirements for engineering noise control, are not being enforced. Sadly, there seems to be little progress in reducing overall noise exposure levels. What needs to be done at this point is a major overhaul of the noise regulation: recommitment to engineering noise control; reduction of the permissible exposure limit (PEL) to 85 dBA; a shift to the 3-dBA exchange rate; and a nationwide assessment of hearing loss in American workers to determine the effectiveness of current hearing conservation measures to identify and address the weaknesses in programs and regulations."
"19249881","The prevalence and correlates of hearing loss in drivers in isfahan, iran.","BACKGROUND: There are no data on the prevalence of occupational noise-induced hearing loss in drivers using standard audiometric testing. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and risk factors of occupational noise-induced hearing loss in drivers.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a random sample of 4300 long-distance drivers age &gt; or =20 years taken out of a total of 10,000 estimated professionals in the city of Isfahan, Iran, from February 2006 through March 2007. The drivers were interviewed and underwent clinical and laboratory examinations including measurement of blood pressure, anthropometric data, and pure-tone audiometry in a sound-treated booths. The mean (SD) age of the participants was 40.8 (11.0) years with a mean (SD) duration of professional driving of 14.7 (9.6) years.RESULTS: The prevalence of bilateral noise-induced hearing loss was 18.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 17.0~19.3]. The prevalence rates were higher in the left ear only 6.5% (95% CI: 5.8~7.3) than the right ear only 3.0 percent; (95% CI: 2.5~3.9). Using a stepwise binary logistic regression model for the right and left ear only and for both ears separately, age was a significant independent predictor of bilateral noise-induced hearing loss and for the left or right ear only. When bilateral noise-induced hearing loss was entered in the model, fasting blood glucose was a significant predictor of noise-induced hearing loss. Blood pressure, cholesterol, triglyceride, body mass index, and marital status had no significant independent association with noise-induced hearing loss when other covariates were considered.CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that noise-induced hearing loss among the long-distance drivers appears to be similar to the world's population endures noise-induced hearing loss caused by occupational exposure to noise, with higher prevalence in the left ear only."
"19206875","Detecting incipient inner-ear damage from impulse noise with otoacoustic emissions.","Audiometric thresholds and otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) were measured in 285 U.S. Marine Corps recruits before and three weeks after exposure to impulse-noise sources from weapons' fire and simulated artillery, and in 32 non-noise-exposed controls. At pre-test, audiometric thresholds for all ears were &lt;or=25 dB HL from 0.5 to 3 kHz and &lt;or=30 dB HL at 4 kHz. Ears with low-level or absent OAEs at pre-test were more likely to be classified with significant threshold shifts (STSs) at post-test. A subgroup of 60 noise-exposed volunteers with complete data sets for both ears showed significant decreases in OAE amplitude but no change in audiometric thresholds. STSs and significant emission shifts (SESs) between 2 and 4 kHz in individual ears were identified using criteria based on the standard error of measurement from the control group. There was essentially no association between the occurrence of STS and SES. There were more SESs than STSs, and the group of SES ears had more STS ears than the group of no-SES ears. The increased sensitivity of OAEs in comparison to audiometric thresholds was shown in all analyses, and low-level OAEs indicate an increased risk of future hearing loss by as much as ninefold."

"19194295","Estimation of equivalent noise exposure level using hearing threshold levels of a population.","OBJECTIVES: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is costly in both human and economic terms. One means of reducing NIHL is to apply engineering controls to hazardous noise sources. To trade off the cost of engineering controls against the total direct monetary costs incurred by NIHL, a means of predicting the amount of NIHL that will be incurred over the life-cycle of a hazardous noise source is necessary. A widely known algorithm for the prediction of NIHL is published in ANSI S3.44-1996. However, the algorithm inputs, noise exposure level and duration, may be difficult to determine in some cases. This paper describes the conceptual basis of an approach for using ANSI S3.44-1996 to predict hearing thresholds in a population even when noise exposure levels and durations are not precisely known, and demonstrates the initial application of this approach to a single military population.DESIGN: Retrospective data were obtained on the hearing-threshold levels, demographic characteristics, and noise exposure history of 250 male U.S. Navy machinists' mates. A maximum-likelihood fitting procedure was developed in which the noise level input to the algorithm was varied in order to determine the noise level that best accounted for all of the data.RESULTS: The maximum likelihood fitting produced a value for the noise level input of approximately 93 dBA, with a standard error of approximately 0.3. The low standard error virtually eliminates any estimate above 94 or below 92 dBA, and indicates that a good fit to the data was achieved.CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrates the feasibility of calibrating the algorithm to an individual population, even when noise exposure level or duration is not precisely known. Future work will focus on validating and generalizing this approach so that it may be used to predict hearing-threshold levels in various populations. Such an approach may be used in calculating potential cost savings in compensable hearing loss due to the application of noise control solutions."

LASI=HTL(0)(3kHz) - HTL (3kHz)+10 log (age - 20) - 10 log (0.23L(EX,8h) - 17.36).RESULTS: When L(EX,8h) exceeds 80dB(A) and HTL(0)(3kHz) is at 25dB, occasional audiometric surveillance may be recommended for workers exposed to hazardous impulse noise: e.g., should the median and the mean LASI values fall below 20 for men or 23 for women (indicative threshold values).CONCLUSION: This exponential model thus integrates the fact that daily exposure to impulse noise may be more harmful for hearing than eight hours exposure to continuous noise of equivalent energy."

They were broken down into two age groups: 30-39years and 40-49years. The high frequencies were studied immediately after conventional audiometry.RESULTS: The results were most significant in the 40 to 49 years of age range, where the experimental group showed significantly higher threshold values than the control group 14000Hz (p = 0.008) and 16,000Hz (p = 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that noise interfered with high frequency thresholds, where all the mean values found in the experimental group were higher than those in the control group. We suggest that these data reinforce the importance of studying high frequencies, even with normal conventional audiometry in the early detection of noise-induced hearing loss."
"21173490","Vuvuzelas at South African soccer matches: risks for spectators' hearing.","South African Premier Soccer League (PSL) matches are known worldwide as some of the noisiest recreational events. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to i) measure noise levels during different PSL matches; ii) measure changes in auditory function after attending PSL matches; and iii) determine the factors that increase the risk of overexposure to noise during PSL matches. The study used a descriptive quantitative analytical pre- and post-exposure design. Participants (n = 19, and n = 10) attended two PSL matches. Each participant's auditory function was assessed using distortion product oto-acoustic emissions (DPOAEs) before and after attending a PSL match. Peak and equivalent continuous noise levels as well as noise dose were measured during each match. Noise levels recorded during the poorly attended Match 1 were lesser than those of the well-attended Match 2. Participants attending Match 2 had statistically significant reduction in their DPOAE amplitudes after the match (P = 0.003) than those attending Match 1. Vuvuzela blowers and participants seated within 1 m from them were most at risk of harm to their hearing with significant reduction in DPOAE amplitudes post the match (P = 0.002 and P = 0.008, respectively). It was therefore concluded that noise levels at well-attended South African PSL matches pose a significant risk to spectators' auditory function as shown by reduced DPOAE amplitude post match attendance. Three risk factors for overexposure to noise during the match were identified: blowing the vuvuzela, close proximity to the individual blowing the vuvuzela as well as spectator turnout at the match."
"21173486","Hearing loss among classical-orchestra musicians.","This study intended to evaluate classical musicians' risk of hearing loss. We studied 63 musicians from four Helsinki classical orchestras. We measured their hearing loss with an audiometer, found their prior amount of exposure to sound and some individual susceptibility factors with a questionnaire, measured their present sound exposure with dosimeters, and tested their blood pressure and cholesterol levels, then compared their hearing loss to ISO 1999-1990's predictions. The musicians' hearing loss distribution corresponded to that of the general population, but highly exposed musicians had greater hearing loss at frequencies over 3 kHz than less-exposed ones. Their individual susceptibility factors were low. Music deteriorates hearing, but by less than what ISO 1999-1990 predicted. The low number of individual susceptibility factors explained the difference, but only reduced hearing loss and not the prevalence of tinnitus."

A three-pronged intervention to increase HPD use was conducted among construction workers and included a baseline hearing loss prevention training, follow-up 'toolbox' (TB) reinforcement trainings, and use of a personal noise level indicator (NLI). A total of 176 subjects on eight sites completed three assessments. Prior to intervention, HPDs were used an average of 34.5% of the time and increased significantly, up about 12.1% after intervention and 7.5% two months after interventions were completed. The increase in HPD use was greatest among the group receiving both TB and NLI interventions; up about 25% from baseline, and this group was about two times more likely to use HPDs than the BL (baseline) training only group. This study demonstrates the mild impact of a well-constructed HPD use training and provides support for the additional use of a personal NLI to increase use of HPDs among construction workers.

Females tended to have less NIHL at given exposure levels than males. Duration of noise exposure stratified by intensity (dBA) was a better predictor of NIHL than the standard equivalent continuous noise level (L(eq)) based upon a 3-dBA exchange. Within this cohort, efficient dBA strata for males were &lt;95 versus = 95, and for females &lt;90 versus = 90. The reported enforced use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) significantly reduced NIHL. The data did not have sufficient within-plant variation to determine the effectiveness of noise monitoring or worker training. An association between increased audiometric testing and NIHL was believed to be an artifact of increased participation in screening.CONCLUSIONS: Historical audiometric data combined with noise monitoring data can be used to better understand the effectiveness of HCPs. Regular collection and maintenance of quality data should be encouraged and used to monitor the effectiveness of these interventions."

"21053386","Predictors of use of hearing protection among a representative sample of farmers.","Farmers experience higher rates of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) than workers in most other industries. We developed a model of farmers' use of hearing protection, and tested it with a random sample (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>532) of farmers from the upper Midwest. Barriers to using hearing protection (e.g., difficulty communicating; OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>.44, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.003) were negatively related to use. Greater access/availability of hearing protectors (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.75, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.010) and male gender (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>.43, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.019) were positively related to use. The model correctly predicted use of hearing protection for 74% of the cases. Overall, farmers demonstrated low hearing protector use, and results were similar to those from previous studies of non-farm workers. Findings from this study will be useful in designing interventions to increase farmers' hearing protector use and decrease their rates of NIHL."

After audiological evaluation (pure tone audiometry, middle ear analysis, TEOAE and DPOAE) hearing protective devices were provided to be used for three months. After that musicians answered a satisfaction assessment questionnaire.RESULTS: The prevalence of hearing loss was of 21.7%. The most common complaints about the hearing protectors were: autophonia, pressure in the ears, interference in high frequencies perception and full time use of the hearing protector during concerts. There was a positive correlation between a reduction in tinnitus after the use of the HPD with the following complaints: tinnitus after beginning the career (p= 0.044), discomfort with the sound intensity in the work place (p= 0.009) and intolerance to loud sound (p= 0.029).CONCLUSIONS: There was a high prevalence of hearing loss and a positive tendency towards the use of the ear protector device among the sample population."

"20828512","Predicting hearing thresholds and occupational hearing loss with multiple-frequency auditory steady-state responses.","OBJECTIVE: An objective investigation is needed to verify the existence and severity of hearing impairments resulting from work-related, noise-induced hearing loss in arbitration of medicolegal aspects. We investigated the accuracy of multiple-frequency auditory steady-state responses (Mf-ASSRs) between subjects with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) with and without occupational noise exposure.DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.SETTING: Tertiary referral medical centre.METHODS: Pure-tone audiometry and Mf-ASSRs were recorded in 88 subjects (34 patients had occupational noise-induced hearing loss [NIHL], 36 patients had SNHL without noise exposure, and 18 volunteers were normal controls).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Inter- and intragroup comparisons were made. A predicting equation was derived using multiple linear regression analysis.RESULTS: ASSRs and pure-tone thresholds (PTTs) showed a strong correlation for all subjects (r = .77  .94). The relationship is demonstrated by the equationThe differences between the ASSR and PTT were significantly higher for the NIHL group than for the subjects with non-noise-induced SNHL (p &lt; .001).CONCLUSIONS: Mf-ASSR is a promising tool for objectively evaluating hearing thresholds. Predictive value may be lower in subjects with occupational hearing loss. Regardless of carrier frequencies, the severity of hearing loss affects the steady-state response. Moreover, the ASSR may assist in detecting noise-induced injury of the auditory pathway. A multiple linear regression equation to accurately predict thresholds was shown that takes into consideration all effect factors."

Audiometry was offered and 169 of the 191 workers assessed for HAVS agreed to have the audiometric test. The objective was to examine the prevalence of hearing loss in these 169 workers and to determine the effect on hearing of duration of work in construction (as a proxy for noise exposure) and the severity of vibration white finger (VWF) which previous studies have suggested is a marker for increased individual susceptibility for NIHL. VWF was measured by the Stockholm vascular scale.RESULTS: All participants were men, median age of 57 (range: 28-75), median number of years worked in construction of 35 (range: 4-52). All of the Spearman rank correlations between years worked in construction and the hearing levels at each audiometric frequency were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). Overall, 31 (18.3%) participants had hearing loss at or above the level at which a workers' compensation pension would be granted in Ontario and the prevalence of this auditory outcome had a statistically significant increase as years worked in construction increased.

"20689029","Listening habits of iPod users.","PURPOSE: To estimate real-environment iPod listening levels for listeners in 4 environments to gain insight into whether average listeners receive dosages exceeding occupational noise exposure guidelines as a result of their listening habits.METHOD: The earbud outputs of iPods were connected directly into the inputs of a digital recorder to make recordings of listening levels. These recordings were used to estimate listening levels using reference recordings made in a real ear. Recordings were made in 4 environments with a wide range of background noises: (a) a library, (b) a student center, (c) busy streets, and (d) the subway.RESULTS: None of the 64 listeners were estimated to exceed allowable occupational dosages, with a maximum dose of 7.57% based on Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA; 1998) methods and 10.83% based on National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH; 1998) methods.CONCLUSIONS: All of the listeners surveyed were exposed to dosages well below OSHA and NIOSH occupational regulations. Although this does not guarantee individual safety, the results do not support the widespread concern regarding the safety of common iPod usage. However, measurements made in this study agree with the finding that iPod output can exceed safe levels and further support recommendations to monitor and limit listening volume and listening duration."
"20603576","Vestibular evoked myogenic potential in noise-induced hearing loss.","Noise affects one's hearing as well as balance mechanism. The hearing mechanism of the noise-exposed individuals has been extensively studied. However, in view of the poor research focus on the sacculo-collic reflexes, especially in this study area, the present study was undertaken to examine the vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP) in subjects with noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). A total of 30 subjects (55 ears) with NIHL participated in the present study within the age range of 30-40 years. VEMP recordings were done at 99 dBnHL using IHS instrument. The results indicated that as the average pure tone hearing threshold increased, the VEMP latencies were prolonged and peak to peak amplitude was reduced in NIHL subjects. Out of the 55 ears, VEMP was absent in 16 (29.0%) ears. The latency was prolonged and the peak to peak amplitude was reduced in 19 (34.6%) ears. VEMP results were normal in 20 (36.4%) ears. Therefore, VEMP was abnormal or absent in 67% of NIHL subjects in the present study. Hence it can be concluded that the possibility of vestibular dysfunction, specially the saccular pathway, is high in individuals with NIHL. VEMP, a non-invasive and user friendly procedure, can be employed in these individuals to assess sacculo-collic reflex."

We calculated percentage loss of hearing (PLH) and used regression models to examine whether there was an association between PLH and F-111 fuel tank maintenance, adjusting for possible confounders. In addition, the difference between the observed hearing thresholds and the expected thresholds based on an otologically normal population (ISO-7029-2003) was determined.RESULTS: The PLH ranged from nil to 96 (median 1.5, quartiles 0.3, 5.5). A logistic regression model showed no statistically significant difference in PLH among the three exposure groups (exposed vs. non-technical controls 1.1: 95% CI 0.7, 2.0 and exposed vs. technical OR 0.9: 95% CI 0.6, 1.3). The model also highlighted a number of other risk factors for PLH including age, tinnitus, smoking, depression, and use of depression medications. However, at all eight frequencies measured, all populations had lower than expected hearing thresholds based on published ISO-7029 medians.CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no difference in PLH between the three exposure groups, the study did reveal a high degree of hearing loss between the 3 groups and a normal population."
"20588120","Application of the kurtosis statistic to the evaluation of the risk of hearing loss in workers exposed to high-level complex noise.","OBJECTIVE: Develop dose-response relations for two groups of industrial workers exposed to Gaussian or non-Gaussian (complex) types of continuous noises and to investigate what role, if any, the kurtosis statistic can play in the evaluation of industrial noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).DESIGN: Audiometric and noise exposure data were acquired on a population (N = 195) of screened workers from a textile manufacturing plant and a metal fabrication facility located in Henan province of China. Thirty-two of the subjects were exposed to non-Gaussian (non-G) noise and 163 were exposed to a Gaussian (G) continuous noise. Each subject was given a general physical and an otologic examination. Hearing threshold levels (0.5-8.0 kHz) were age adjusted (ISI-1999) and the prevalence of NIHL at 3, 4, or 6 kHz was determined. The kurtosis metric, which is sensitive to the peak and temporal characteristics of a noise, was introduced into the calculation of the cumulative noise exposure metric. Using the prevalence of hearing loss and the cumulative noise exposure metric, a dose-response relation for the G and non-G noise-exposed groups was constructed.RESULTS: An analysis of the noise environments in the two plants showed that the noise exposures in the textile plant were of a Gaussian type with an Leq(A)8hr that varied from 96 to 105 dB whereas the exposures in the metal fabrication facility with an Leq(A)8hr = 95 dB were of a non-G type containing high levels (up to 125 dB peak SPL) of impact noise. The kurtosis statistic was used to quantify the deviation of the non-G noise environment from the Gaussian. The dose-response relation for the non-G noise-exposed subjects showed a higher prevalence of hearing loss for a comparable cumulative noise exposure than did the G noise-exposed subjects. By introducing the kurtosis variable into the temporal component of the cumulative noise exposure calculation, the two dose-response curves could be made to overlap, essentially yielding an equivalent noise-induced effect for the two study groups.CONCLUSIONS: For the same exposure level, the prevalence of NIHL is greater in workers exposed to non-G noise environments than for workers exposed to G noise. The kurtosis metric may be a reasonable candidate for use in modifying exposure level calculations that are used to estimate the risk of NIHL from any type of noise exposure environment. However, studies involving a large number of workers with well-documented exposures are needed before a relation between a metric such as the kurtosis and the risk of hearing loss can be refined."
"20584863","Temporary threshold shifts at 1500 and 2000 Hz induced by loud voice signals communicated through earphones in the pinball industry.","To assess the risk of hearing loss among workers using earphones as communication devices at noisy worksites, we compared temporary threshold shifts (TTS) between ears on which workers wore earphones and ears on which no earphones were worn. We measured ambient noise and personal noise exposure as well as noise generated by and passed through earphones by applying frequency analysis at three pinball facilities during their hours of actual operation. We assessed hearing levels before and after a work shift (prework and postwork) of 54 workers by pure tone audiometry at six frequencies. The time-weighted averages for ambient noise and personal noise exposure exceeded 85 dB(A) and 90 dB(A), respectively. Overall sound pressure levels generated by and passing through earphones reached 109 dB(A). The one-third octave band spectrum of the earphone noise during the shift exceeded 90 dB(SPL) in the range of 315-2000 Hz. The number of ears demonstrating a TTS, defined as a shift of 10 dB or more in postwork over prework hearing thresholds, was significantly greater at 1500 and 2000 Hz among ears with earphones (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively) compared to those without. The reverse was observed at 4000 Hz for ears without earphones (P &lt; 0.01). Workers wearing earphones or headsets as communication devices in noisy environments are exposed to high risk of hearing loss, particularly at the frequencies of 1500 and 2000 Hz. Ideally, hearing conservation programs for such workers should account for potential hearing losses at frequencies of 2000 Hz or lower frequencies induced by amplified voice signals."
"20581779","Screening protocols for the prevention of occupational noise-induced hearing loss: the role of conventional and extended high frequency audiometry may vary according to the years of employment.","BACKGROUND: Although occupational noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) has become a major problem in industrialized societies, there is a notable lack of effective screening protocols to ensure its early diagnosis. The aim of this study was to detect a potential role of extended high frequency (EHF) audiometry in industrial hearing screening protocols.METHODS: The population consisted of 151 persons, working for 8 hours daily in a noisy environment (90-110 dBA). The changes of hearing thresholds in industrial workers were analyzed, not only with respect to their age, as has been presented by previous studies, but also with respect to the duration of their previous employment.RESULTS: During the first 10 years of employment, the frequencies 12500, 14000 and 16000Hz were the only ones significantly affected. For the second decade of employment, thresholds were significantly elevated only at 2000 and 4000Hz. After exceeding 20 years of employment, the affected frequencies were 250, 500 and 1000Hz. The effects of age on hearing acuity were significant at all frequencies for the first 2 groups.CONCLUSIONS: EHF audiometry seems able to identify the first signs of NIHL, much earlier than conventional audiometry, and therefore may need to be implemented in the screening examinations especially of workers with less than 1 decade of employment. Hearing screening protocols could become more efficient by adjusting their frequency ranges according to the frequencies &quot;at risk&quot;, which correspond to the duration of the workers' previous employment."
"20516680","The Annex C fallacy: why unscreened databases are usually preferable for comparison of industrially exposed groups.","One can study occupational noise exposure by comparing hearing thresholds of exposed people to control data from national or international standards. ANSI S3.44 (1996) offers Annex C--thresholds for people without occupational noise exposure--as appropriate control data for such comparisons. Annex C is based on the false assumption that people who have had occupational noise exposure are similar in all other important ways to those without such exposures. In fact, people with noisy jobs are more likely than others to be smokers, diabetics, poorly educated, white and exposed to non-occupational noise. Taking these other risk factors into account, the appropriate thresholds for comparison to industrial study populations are closer to those of the unscreened population than to an 'Annex C' population that simply excludes occupationally noise-exposed persons."

Various treatment modalities have been proposed, some combining medical treatment with hyperbaric oxygen (HBOT) in various ways. We have reviewed the therapeutic effect of primary protocols, with or without HBOT, used in our hospital.METHODS: Sixty-eight soldiers for all of whom pre-AAT audiometry tests were available, were treated with one of three different regimens. Group 1 received oral medication only. Group 2 received HBOT twice a day for 3 days then once a day (7 days), combined with intravenous medication (5 days) followed by oral treatment. Group 3 received HBOT once a day and oral medication for 10 days. Medical treatment consisted of methylprednisolone and piracetam in all groups. Control audiometry was performed after 10 days. Average Hearing Gain (AHG) and Average Residual Hearing Loss (ARHL) were calculated.RESULTS: The mean AHG in Group 1 was +5.58  3.58 dB (mean  SD); in Group 2 it was +20.62  17.68 dB; and in Group 3 +17.0  14.0 dB (P = 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test). The mean ARHL without HBOT was -14.7  8.27 dB (Group 1), and respectively -2.36  10.69 dB (Group 2) and -5.0  8.0 dB (Group 3) in the HBOT groups (P = 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test).CONCLUSION: These results indicate a significant benefit for the combination of HBOT and medical therapy over medical treatment alone. Which of the two HBOT regimens is the more effective, remains to be determined."
"20430548","The impact of arterial sclerosis on hearing with and without occupational noise exposure: a population-based aging study in males.","OBJECTIVES: Arterial sclerosis contributes to inadequate blood supply to multiple organs, suggesting that general atherosclerosis may play an important role in the inner ear. Since noise is a major etiology for hearing loss, the aim of this study was to evaluate both the respective and the combined effects of arterial sclerosis and occupational noise exposure on hearing after accounting for age in middle-aged and elderly men.METHODS: The evaluation was conducted using 773 subjects from a population-based sample of 1189 men, aged 40-83 years. The impact of carotid atherosclerosis (CA) or retinal arteriolosclerosis (RA) on hearing was assessed according to history of occupational noise exposure (Noise) obtained in a questionnaire. Differences in the mean pure-tone thresholds at each frequency, between the CA (+) and CA (-) groups or between the RA (+) and RA (-) groups, based on noise exposure were compared using the general linear model (GLM) Procedure in SAS, with adjustments for age. Then, the main effect of CA or RA, and the interactive effect of noise and either CA or RA on pure-tone threshold at seven frequencies were analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), after adjusting for age.RESULTS: In the Noise (+) group, a statistically significant deterioration in hearing was found in the CA (+) group compared with the CA (-) group at 500 and 1000 Hz. The results in RA were significant at even lower frequencies than in CA. In the results from ANCOVA, the significant main effect of CA was shown in the pure-tone threshold at 8000 Hz, but not in the analysis of RA. A significant interactive effect of either CA or RA and Noise was observed in hearing at the range from 125 to 1000 Hz.CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that the impact of arterial sclerosis on hearing is limited but significantly hazardous in middle-aged and elderly men, and that arterial sclerosis exacerbates the deleterious effects of noise on hearing. Early recognition of arterial sclerosis might be contributory to the hearing prognosis after middle age, especially for noise-exposed men."

We used their self-reported data in conjunction with published average sound levels of music players, discotheques, and pop concerts to estimate their noise exposure, and we compared that exposure to our own &quot;loosened&quot; (i.e., less strict) version of current European safety standards for occupational noise exposure.RESULTS: About half of the adolescents exceeded safety standards for occupational noise exposure. About one third of the respondents exceeded safety standards solely as a result of listening to MP3 players. Hearing symptoms that occurred after using an MP3 player or going to a discotheque were associated with exposure to high-volume music.CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents often exceeded current occupational safety standards for noise exposure, highlighting the need for specific safety standards for leisure-time noise exposure."
"20378580","Ototoxic potential of JP-8 and a Fischer-Tropsch synthetic jet fuel following subacute inhalation exposure in rats.","This study was undertaken to identify the ototoxic potential of two jet fuels presented alone and in combination with noise. Rats were exposed via a subacute inhalation paradigm to JP-8 jet fuel, a kerosene-based fuel refined from petroleum, and a synthetic fuel produced by the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process. Although JP-8 contains small ( approximately 5%) concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons some of which known to be ototoxic, the synthetic fuel does not. The objectives of this study were to identify a lowest observed adverse effect level and a no observed adverse effect level for each jet fuel and to provide some preliminary, but admittedly, indirect evidence concerning the possible role of the aromatic hydrocarbon component of petroleum-based jet fuel on hearing. Rats (n = 5-19) received inhalation exposure to JP-8 or to FT fuel for 4 h/day on five consecutive days at doses of 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/m(3). Additional groups were exposed to various fuel concentrations followed by 1 h of an octave band of noise, noise alone, or no exposure to fuel or noise. Significant dose-related impairment in the distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) was seen in subjects exposed to combined JP-8 plus noise exposure when JP-8 levels of at least 1000 mg/m(3) were presented. No noticeable impairment was observed at JP-8 levels of 500 mg/m(3) + noise. In contrast to the effects of JP-8 on noise-induced hearing loss, FT exposure had no effect by itself or in combination with noise exposure even at the highest exposure level tested. Despite an observed loss in DPOAE amplitude seen only when JP-8 and noise were combined, there was no loss in auditory threshold or increase in hair cell loss in any exposure group."
"20361699","[Comparative analysis of audiometric and impedancemetric findings in workers exposed to the effects of various duration industrial noise].","AIM: Industrial noise is produced in workshops due to factory machinery and tools used in technological processes. It has detrimental effect to primarily the organ of the sense of hearing, thus damaging hearing in oversensitive subjects. The aim of the study was to perform a detailed analysis of audiometric and, especially, impedancemetric parameters in workers exposed to the effects of industrial noise of various duration, as well as to determine similarities and differences in workers with differences in sensitivity to damaging effects of noise.METHODS: The study included a homogenous group of 173 industrial workers involved in the same department of a huge workshop named &quot;Kovacica&quot; exposed to noise level above a threshold intensity, and divided into three groups: the group I of 116 workers (232 ears) exposed to noise for 8 h in the workshop &quot;Kovacica&quot;, the group II of 41 workers (82 ears) exposed to noise only half of the working time, and the group III of 16 workers (32 ears) exposed to the same conditions and having the normal hearing sense. The group III served as a control group. Prior to the study any workers went through a thorough anamnesis and complete ORL examination, and then they were submitted to audiometric testing. The study included only the workers with no hearing damage due to diseases, injuries nor other detrimental factors in order to be sure that the hearing findings had been caused by industrial noise.RESULTS: The results obtained by audiometric testing showed that 90.75% of the workers had hearing damage of various degrees, while 9.25% of the workers had regular hearing although had been exposed to the same conditions. More severe hearing damage was revealed in the workers of the group I. Tympanometricly, in most ears of the group I workers (65.52%) a compliance value was found to be more than 0.9 cm3, while in the majority of those of the group II (59.75%) a compliance value was in the range from 0.5 to 0.9 cm3. In the workers of the group III with no hearing damage, a compliance value for any ears was in the range from 0.1 to 0.9 cm3. Mean value of threshold reflex (98.56 dB) at 500 Hz and 1 000 Hz in the group I was increased as compared with the group II (95.6 dB) and the group III (84.38 dB). At higher frequences, 2 000 and 4 000 Hz, threshold reflex was increased in the group I (99.05 dB), and in the group II (97.6 dB) as compared with the group III (86.4 dB). The amplitude of stapedic reflex was lowest in the group I, while mean values of amplitude at 500, 1 000, 2 000 and at 4 000 Hz were 2.31, 1.38, 1 and 0.3, respectively. In the group II mean values of amplitude at 500, 1 000, 2 000 and 4 000 Hz were 2.52, 1.80, 1.30 and 0.5, respectively. In the group III mean values of amplitude at 500, 1 000, 2 000 and at 4 000 Hz were 2.36, 2.45, 2.5 and 2.08, respectively. By measuring input (rising) and output angles it was revealed that most ears of the workers in the groups I and II had rising angle ranging from 41 to 50 degrees, and in the workers with no hearing loss from 31 to 50 degrees. In the majority of the ears of the groups I and II outlet angle was in the range from 16 to 35 degrees, and in the workers with no hearing damage from 26 to 35 degrees.CONCLUSION: By audiometric and impedancemetric examinations it was determined that for the sense of hearing it is significant not only a threshold hearing expressed in the audiometric curve at various frequences, but also a threshold of unpleasantness and pain under higher intensities shown by the occurrence of stapedic reflex. The less hearing field between threshold hearing and threshold acustic reflex is, the less capabilities of hearing perception due to the occurrence of recrutment."

Historical estimates of noise exposure can be adjusted according to models predictions and a reduction in misclassifying workers, exposure is expected.METHODS: Work history and exposure information were obtained for 13,147 lumber mill workers followed from 1909 until 1998.

Following the modeling of HPD use, noise estimates were adjusted according to models predictions and attenuation factors based on existing research and standards. Adjusted and unadjusted noise metrics were compared by investigating their ability to predict noise-induced hearing loss.RESULTS: We showed a 4-fold increase in the noise exposure and hearing loss slope, after adjusting for HPD use, while controlling for gender, age, race, as well as medical and non-occupational confounding variables.CONCLUSION: While the relative difference before and after adjustment for use of HPD is considerable, we observed a subtle absolute magnitude of the effect. Using noise-induced hearing loss as a 'gold standard' for testing the assessment of retrospective noise exposure estimates should continue to be investigated."
"20233141","Prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss in student musicians.","This study describes the prevalence and characteristics of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in student musicians (N = 329) aged 18-25 years. Students completed a questionnaire regarding exposures before a hearing assessment. NIHL was defined by the presence of a notch 15 dB in depth at 4000 or 6000 Hz relative to the best preceding threshold. Overall prevalence of NIHL was 45%, with 78% of notches occurring at 6000 Hz. The proportion of the total population with bilateral notching at any frequency was 11.5%, mostly occurring at 6000 Hz. There was a significant increase in the frequency of notching in students who reported more than two hours per day of personal practice. There were no significant associations for instrument group or other noise exposures. The data suggest that susceptibility to NIHL among students of music is not uniform and cannot be ascribed solely to the instrument played and other exposures. Students with bilateral losses tend to have deeper notches and may represent a group that has an inherent predisposition to NIHL."
"20218750","Improving hearing health for farming families.","INTRODUCTION: Occupational noise injury and hearing loss are common features of agricultural workforces internationally. Farmsafe Australia has identified hearing health as one of its 4 key priority goals and targets. Currently, approximately 60-70% of Australian farmers have measurable hearing loss, compared with 27% of those in the general Australian community. This article describes the findings of a community based demonstration project to address hearing health issues conducted in the Australian state of New South Wales. This program sought to implement local demonstration projects in 3 communities to identify what works well in hearing health promotion with farmers and what could be applied more broadly throughout Australia.METHODS: Local advisory groups were established in each community to guide project development and implementation. Project implementation focused on 3 major aspects: (1) increasing awareness of priority noise injury prevention and hearing health practices; (2) improving access to hearing health services; and (3) networking services in local communities. Area-specific training was undertaken for stakeholders to maximize local information links. Service utilization data were monitored and analysed.RESULTS: There was variability among sites; however in general there was an increased awareness of hearing health issues by farming families and expanded opportunities for farmers to access screening services. Utilization rates of hearing services also increased markedly in one community. Local hearing health networks were strengthened by linkages to key stakeholders outside the health sector. Previously unidentified methods of promoting hearing health (eg using agricultural retail outlets that supply hearing protection equipment and are accepted by farmers as an information source) were identified and utilized.CONCLUSIONS: Hearing health promotion with farmers in local communities can be enhanced through utilization and strengthening of local networks. Integration of hearing health initiatives with other agencies already working with farming families will be important in developing and enhancing long-term sustainable outcomes. Continued work at a national level to assist in stimulating local action will be required to build on the potential gains in reducing noise injury in the farming community."
"20192875","Otoacoustic emissions in a hearing conservation program: general applicability in longitudinal monitoring and the relation to changes in pure-tone thresholds.","The hearing status of workers (N = 233) in a printing office was assessed twice within seventeen months by pure-tone audiometry and otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). One of the questions was how a quality criterion of OAE-measurements based on a minimum signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) would affect the applicability on the entire population. Secondly, effects of noise exposure were investigated in overall changes in audiogram and OAE-measurements. For TEOAEs (transient evoked OAEs) in the frequency band of 4 kHz, only 55% of the data points meet the SNR-inclusion criterion. For DPOAEs (distortion product OAEs) around 6 kHz approximately 80% of the data points satisfy the criterion. Thus OAEs have a limited applicability for monitoring the hearing status of this entire population. Audiometry shows significant deteriorations at 6 and 8 kHz. TEOAEs show a significant decline at all frequency bands (1-4 kHz), DPOAEs between 4 and 8 kHz and less pronounced between 1 and 2 kHz. On group level, OAEs show a decline in a larger frequency region than the audiogram, suggesting an increased sensitivity of OAEs compared to audiometry."
"20191147","Sensorineural hearing loss in high school teenagers in Mexico City and its relationship with recreational noise.","The aim of this study was to measure the frequency of hearing loss in a sample of typical public high-school students exposed to recreational noise, and determine associated risk factors. The sample was made up of 214 teenagers from a high-school in Mexico City; subjects were selected randomly per strata. We applied a questionnaire to identify risk factors for hearing loss and performed a battery of audiologic tests consisting of otoscopy, tympanometry, and pure-tone audiometry. The mean age of the sample was 16 +/- 1.07 years; 73% were male and 27%, female. Hearing loss was found in 21% of students. The main hearing loss-related risk factor was exposure to recreational noise: frequent attendance at discotheques and pop-music concerts; use of personal stereos; and noise exposure in school workshops. The high frequency of hearing loss in high school students from one Mexico City school (nearly one fifth of the sample) was found to be related to noise exposure mainly during recreational activities."
"22569326","Evaluation of acoustic shock induced early hearing loss with audiometer and distortion product otoacoustic emissions.","BACKGROUND: Acoustic shock injury has been described as a permanent injury to the auditory system either due to daily noise dose of in excess of 85 decibels or very loud impulse sound reputed to be in excess of 120 decibels and acoustic incidents. This study was performed to compare the results of audiogram and the newer diagnostic method distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) parameters due to acoustic shock injury in call center professionals working in a noisy environment and prone to acoustic injury.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hearing functions of 340 subjects were first assessed with pure tone audiometry and then DPOAEs results were compared among acoustic shock exposed subjects with normal audiogram and those with abnormal audiogram.RESULTS: Out of 340 acoustic shock exposed subjects 304 were normal on audiometric testing and 34 had abnormal audiograms. Subsequently on DPOAE testing out of 304 acoustic shock exposed subjects with normal audiogram 125 failed and 181 passed.CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that DPOAEs are more sensitive than audiometry to detect pre-symptomatic inner ear damage. It may play a role as screening and monitoring test for acoustic shock-exposed workers."
"20160390","Noise induced hearing loss risk assessment in truck drivers.","Hearing sense is one of the key elements which may have impact on the driver's task quality. This cross-sectional study investigates the hearing status of 500 truck drivers by pure tone audiometry (AC) in one of the cities in Fars province, Iran. Hearing threshold levels of the subjects were measured in frequencies of 500Hz-8000Hz. Screening and determination of permanent threshold shift (PTS) was the first aim of this study. Hence tests were done at least 16 hours after any exposure to noticeable sound. The effect of age as a confounding factor was considered using ISO equation and subtracted from whole hearing threshold. The threshold of 25 dB HL and above was considered abnormal but the calculation of hearing was also carried out using 0 dB HL as reference. Subjects were categorized into two groups on the basis of working experience and the hearing threshold of 25 dB was considered a boundary of normal hearing sense. The results of Pearson Chi-Square test showed that working experience as an independent variable has significant contributing effect on hearing thresholds of truck drivers in frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz (p greater than 0.05). Also, it was shown that currently nine and 12.6 % of truck drivers suffer from impaired hearing sense in left and right respectively (hearing threshold level greater than 25 dB) in mid frequencies (500, 1000, 2000 Hz) and 45% in high frequencies of both ears (4000 and 8000 Hz). The results indicated that hearing damage of professional drivers was expected to occur sooner at 4000 and 8000 Hz than lower frequencies. Finally it was deduced that the occupational conditions of truck drivers may have bilateral, symmetrical harmful effect on hearing threshold sense in all frequencies mainly in frequency of 4000 Hz, so health surveillance programs such as education and periodic medical examinations are emphasized for pre-diagnosing and prevention of any possible impairment and an urgent need to take up some interventions such as better maintenance of roads, automobile industry efforts to reduce the noise level emission of vehicles and reducing number of working hours per day of drivers are highlighted to improve the harmful working conditions of truck drivers."
"20160389","Occupational exposure in small and medium scale industry with specific reference to heat and noise.","This study was undertaken to assess heat and noise exposure and occupational safety practices in small and medium scale casting and forging units (SMEs) of Northern India. We conducted personal interviews of 350 male workers of these units through a comprehensive questionnaire and collected information on heat and noise exposure, use of protective equipment, sweat loss and water intake, working hour. The ambient wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT index) was measured using quest temp 34/36o area heat stress monitor. A-weighted Leq ambient noise was measured using a quest sound level meter &quot;ANSI SI. 43-1997 (R 2002) type-1 model SOUNDPRO SE/DL&quot;. We also incorporated OSHA norms for hearing conservation which include - an exchange rate of 5dB(A), criterion level at 90dB(A), criterion time of eight hours, threshold level is equal to 80dB(A), upper limit is equal to 140dB(A) and with F/S response rate. Results of the study revealed that occupational heat exposure in melting, casting, forging and punching sections is high compared to ACGIH/NIOSH norms. Ambience noise in various sections like casting / molding, drop forging, cutting presses, punching, grinding and barreling process was found to be more than 90dB(A). About 95% of the workers suffered speech interference where as high noise annoyance was reported by only 20%. Overall, 68% workers were not using any personal protective equipment (PPE). The study concluded that the proportion of SME workers exposed to high level heat stress and noise (60 - 72 hrs/week) is high. The workers engaged in forging and grinding sections are more prone to noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) at higher frequencies as compared to workers of other sections. It is recommended that there is a strong need to implement the standard of working hours as well as heat stress and noise control measures."
"20151883","High frequency audiometric notch: an outpatient clinic survey.","It is a common misconception that high frequency audiometric notches are diagnostic of noise induced hearing loss. The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of high frequency notch (HFN) in an audiovestibular medicine outpatient clinic population at a district general hospital. One hundred and forty nine consecutive adult patients were assessed. According to standard practice at the audiovestibular clinic, a full clinical history with particular emphasis on neuro-otological symptoms, noise exposure, and medical risk factors for sensorineural hearing loss was taken. After standard 8-frequency pure tone audiometry, subjects were divided into those with HFN and those without. There were 84 (56%) females and 65 (44%) males with a mean age of 45 years (range: 19 to 91 years). A total of 39.6% had notches not attributable to noise (occupational or recreational) or any other known risk factor. In 29 (49.2%) and 15 (25.4%) the HFN was present in the left and right ear respectively whereas 15 (25.4%) were bilateral. The frequency least affected was 3 kHz while 4 kHz and 6 kHz were affected in almost equal proportions. In 53 ears (71.6%), the notch depth was less than 20 dBHL (10-19 dB) compared to 21 ears (28.4%) with a depth of 20 dBHL or more. This study concludes that high frequency notch without excessive noise exposure or any other known factor is common. It is neither diagnostic of, nor invariable with NIHL unless a convincing history of hazardous noise exposure is elicited from the history."
"20127062","[Problematic medical expertise concerning simulation and aggravation in audiology].","BACKGROUND: The effect of an incorrect audiological medical assessment of noise trauma deafness can be substantial. The impact will be demonstrated using a case example. The reasons for incorrect assessment are often insufficient examination conditions or simulation and aggression of the subject. The results of a study on this topic will be presented.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 61 patients who underwent a psycho-acoustic medical assessment were grouped into 1 of 4 categories ranging from category 0 for no simulation or aggravation to category III for severe simulation and aggravation. For category III reliable and valid thresholds of pure tone audiometry can only be achieved using objective audiological measurements. The frequency, extent and socio-economic factors were evaluated.RESULTS: Of the 61 individuals 26 showed no simulation or aggravation behavior (category 0), 10% were grouped into category III and 48% into categories I and II. The tendency to simulation and aggravation increased with the patients' age, the level of education and the frequency of medical examinations prior to this investigation.CONCLUSIONS: Simulation and aggravation is a more frequent phenomenon than previously assumed (approximately 58% of all audiological examinations). The effect in terms of economical damage could be substantial. The usage of a well-defined classification is highly recommended in order to improve the quality of medical assessment in ENT."

Taken together, specific working conditions in civil aviation, socio-economic factors, and the structure of morbidity among the flight personnel hinder differential diagnosis of occupational loss of hearing in the pilots. A method for retrospective analysis of dynamic audiometry data is proposed to elucidate pathogenesis of occupational neurosensory deafness in the flight personnel. The method is based on the analysis of results of clinical and audiologic studies taking into consideration concomitant pathology (if any), age-related changes in the health status, intra-cabin aircraft noise characteristics, and objective evaluation of noise load on the organ of hearing during the entire period of professional occupation of individual members of the flight personnel. It is concluded that introduction of this method into routine practice of medical examination of the flight personnel in civilian aviation may contribute to the lowering of the frequency of hyperdiagnosis of occupational deafness in this category of workers."

Pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the development of occupational deafness were shown to depend on intensity and duration of the action of these factors. Impedancometry was used to evaluate the functional state of the middle ear and to study protective and adaptive potential of ear muscles. Criteria are proposed for the identification of groups of workers at risk of development of occupational deafness. The relationship between individual features of cerebral hemodynamics and the functional state of the middle ear is established."

The audiologic examination involved members of locomotive crews of the railroad transport and included impedancometry, threshold tonal audiometry, and registration of two types of evoked otoacoustic emission (delayed evoked otoacoustic emission and distortion product otoacoustic emission). Characteristics of otoacoustic emission in subjects with occupational loss of hearing were compared with those in patients with neurosensory deafness of a different etiology. It was shown that registration of different classes of evoked otoacoustic emission makes it possible to recognize early pre-clinical signs of inner ear disorders caused by intense occupational noise. The changes are first and foremost apparent within a frequency band of 4 kHz. At the same time, registration of individual types of evoked otoacoustic emission does not permit to differentiate between occupational loss of hearing and neurosensory deafness of other origin."

Firearm noise levels were evaluated, subjects answered a questionnaire and underwent threshold tonal audiometry and otoacoustic emissions testing.RESULTS: The average noise level was 125 dB(C). Most subjects (78%) believe that noise may cause hearing loss; nearly all (92.3%) used ear noise protectors while shooting, but most (32.3%) had never received guidance for using this equipment. There were significant differences between the two groups in relation to changes suggesting impact noise-induced hearing loss.CONCLUSION: The differences between groups show that noise-exposed military personnel are more likely to develop hearing loss. The goal of a hearing conservation program for this population should be to preserve hearing and educate these individuals about the importance of using hearing protection correctly."
"22176308","Measurement of impulse peak insertion loss for four hearing protection devices in field conditions.","OBJECTIVE: In 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed an impulse noise reduction rating (NRR) for hearing protection devices based upon the impulse peak insertion loss (IPIL) methods in the ANSI S12.42-2010 standard. This study tests the ANSI S12.42 methods with a range of hearing protection devices measured in field conditions.DESIGN: The method utilizes an acoustic test fixture and three ranges for impulse levels: 130-134, 148-152, and 166-170 dB peak SPL. For this study, four different models of hearing protectors were tested: Bilsom 707 Impact II electronic earmuff, EAR Pod Express, EAR Combat Arms version 4, and the Etymotic Research, Inc. Electronic BlastPLG EB1.STUDY SAMPLE: Five samples of each protector were fitted on the fixture or inserted in the fixture's ear canal five times for each impulse level. Impulses were generated by a 0.223 caliber rifle.RESULTS: The average IPILs increased with peak pressure and ranged between 20 and 38 dB. For some protectors, significant differences were observed across protector examples of the same model, and across insertions.CONCLUSIONS: The EPA's proposed methods provide consistent and reproducible results. The proposed impulse NRR rating should utilize the minimum and maximum protection percentiles as determined by the ANSI S12.42-2010 methods."

A single audiologist reviewed the results. Students completed a survey assessing their noise exposures.SETTING: A public high school in Pennsylvania.PARTICIPANTS: Eleventh-grade students.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Notched audiometric configurations on the pure-tone threshold test.RESULTS: Among 296 participants, 78 (26.4%) failed pure-tone threshold testing compared with 15 (5.1%) failing rapid hearing screening. Among those failing the pure-tone threshold testing, 67 (85.9%) failed due to notched audiometric configurations. Self-reported headphone use with an MP3 player was significantly associated with notched audiometric configurations compared with use of earbuds or stereo connection/docking systems.CONCLUSIONS: Pure-tone threshold testing incorporating high frequencies detects adolescent hearing loss more often than rapid hearing screens. Most state hearing screens omit high-frequency testing, potentially missing high-frequency losses, such as noise-induced hearing loss. Because noise-induced hearing loss in particular is preventable and hazardous noise exposures have increased, a reliable school hearing screen to detect high-frequency hearing loss in adolescents is warranted."

Results of the study indicate that the exposure to noise for 6 days increased blood concentration of MDA, decreased concentrations of reduced GSH, antioxidant enzyme activity of SOD and plasma total antioxidant status in control (noise) group. Vitamin E- supplemented group showed decline in oxidative stress reflected by significant decrease in blood concentration of MDA and increase in antioxidant enzyme activity of erythrocyte SOD. Results of audiometric studies revealed that breathing of carbogen prevented the development of temporary threshold shift; thereby reducing the risk of noise induced hearing loss."

The development of novel therapeutic agents to reduce NIHL will potentially benefit multiple very large noise-exposed populations. Oxidative stress has been identified as a significant contributor to noise-induced sensory cell death and NIHL, and several antioxidant strategies have now been suggested for potential translation to human subjects. One such strategy is a combination of beta-carotene, vitamins C and E, and magnesium, which has shown promise for protection against NIHL in rodent models, and is being evaluated in a series of international human clinical trials using temporary (military gunfire, audio player use) and permanent (stamping factory, military airbase) threshold shift models (NCT00808470). The noise exposures used in the recently completed Swedish military gunfire study described in this report did not, on average, result in measurable changes in auditory function using conventional pure-tone thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) amplitudes as metrics. However, analysis of the plasma samples confirmed significant elevations in the bloodstream 2 hours after oral consumption of active clinical supplies, indicating the dose is realistic. The plasma outcomes are encouraging, but clinical acceptance of any novel therapeutic critically depends on demonstration that the agent reduces noise-induced threshold shift in randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective human clinical trials. Although this noise insult did not induce hearing loss, the trial design and study protocol can be applied to other populations exposed to different noise insults."
"22122956","High-frequency audiometry: a means for early diagnosis of noise-induced hearing loss.","Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), an irreversible disorder, is a common problem in industrial settings. Early diagnosis of NIHL can help prevent the progression of hearing loss, especially in speech frequencies. For early diagnosis of NIHL, audiometry is performed routinely in conventional frequencies. We designed this study to compare the effect of noise on high-frequency audiometry (HFA) and conventional audiometry. In a historical cohort study, we compared hearing threshold and prevalence of hearing loss in conventional and high frequencies of audiometry among textile workers divided into two groups: With and without exposure to noise more than 85 dB. The highest hearing threshold was observed at 4000 Hz, 6000 Hz and 16000 Hz in conventional right ear audiometry, conventional left ear audiometry and HFA in each ear, respectively. The hearing threshold was significantly higher at 16000 Hz compared to 4000. Hearing loss was more common in HFA than conventional audiometry. HFA is more sensitive to detect NIHL than conventional audiometry. It can be useful for early diagnosis of hearing sensitivity to noise, and thus preventing hearing loss in lower frequencies especially speech frequencies."

Hearing thresholds for the air conduction frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 kHz) in both ears were analysed together with biographical and occupational data. Subjects were divided into two experimental (single TB treatment, n=911 and multiple TB treatment, n=376) and one control group (n=1411). Comparisons between groups included (1) change from baseline to most recent audiogram, (2) most recent hearing thresholds and (3) most recent thresholds in a subset of noise exposed and unexposed groups.RESULTS: Hearing thresholds for the TB groups were significantly (p&lt;0.01) elevated compared to the control group, after correcting for time between baseline and most recent audiogram, threshold at baseline and age at test. Pair-wise comparisons demonstrated the largest threshold differences between the control and multiple TB group. Changes in mean thresholds across TB treatment groups were independent of noise exposure. Hearing thresholds over time also deteriorated significantly more (p&lt;0.01) in workers with TB (single and multiple treatment) than in workers without TB.CONCLUSION: Gold miners with TB, especially with more than one episode of TB, demonstrate significantly poorer hearing thresholds and more pronounced decline in hearing over time independent of noise exposure. The exact cause is likely a complex interaction between TB, including treatment, and its associated risk profile."

"21988504","Speech-in-noise screening tests by internet, part 1: test evaluation for noise-induced hearing loss identification.","OBJECTIVE: In the Netherlands three internet-based self-screening tests have been developed; the National Hearing Test (NHT), Earcheck (EC), and Occupational Earcheck (OEC). These tests are adaptive speech-in-noise tests using either digit triplets or monosyllables, presented in stationary speech-shaped noise. These tests can be highly valuable in increasing the awareness and prevention of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). This study evaluates these online speech-in-noise tests and investigates their potential to detect NIHL.DESIGN: In a multi-centre study the results of the three online screening tests are compared to pure-tone audiometry and to the Dutch sentence SRT test ( Plomp &amp; Mimpen, 1979a ), which is considered the clinical standard.STUDY SAMPLE: In total, 49 normal-hearing listeners and 49 patients with different degrees of NIHL participated.RESULTS: The online tests show good reliability, but there is much overlap in outcomes between normal-hearing listeners and participants with early NIHL. In addition, rather low correlations of the test results with both the Dutch sentence SRT test and pure-tone thresholds are found. These findings result in rather low test sensitivity: 54% (NHT) and 51% (EC), or low specificity: 49% (OEC).CONCLUSIONS: The online screening tests in their current form are unsuitable to be used for early NIHL screening purposes."
"21987700","Randomized trial of a hearing conservation intervention for rural students: long-term outcomes.","OBJECTIVES: We had the rare opportunity to conduct a cluster-randomized controlled trial to observe the long-term (16-year) effects of a well-designed hearing conservation intervention for rural high school students. This trial assessed whether the intervention resulted in (1) reduced prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) assessed clinically and/or (2) sustained use of hearing protection devices.METHODS: In 1992-1996, 34 rural Wisconsin schools were recruited and 17 were assigned randomly to receive a comprehensive, 3-year, hearing conservation intervention. In 2009-2010, extensive efforts were made to find and contact all students who completed the original trial. Participants in the 16-year follow-up study completed an exposure history questionnaire and a clinical audiometric examination. Rates of NIHL and use of hearing protection were compared.RESULTS: We recruited 392 participants from the original trial, 200 (53%) from the intervention group and 192 (51%) from the control group. Among participants with exposure to agricultural noise, the intervention group reported significantly greater use of hearing protection compared with the control group (25.9% vs 19.6%; P = .015). The intervention group also reported significantly greater use of hearing protection for shooting guns (56.2% vs 41.6%; P = .029), but the groups reported similar uses of protection in other contexts. There was no significant difference between groups with respect to objective measures of NIHL.CONCLUSION: This novel trial provides objective evidence that a comprehensive educational intervention by itself may be of limited effectiveness in preventing NIHL in a young rural population."
"21970351","Speech-in-noise screening tests by internet, part 2: improving test sensitivity for noise-induced hearing loss.","OBJECTIVE: An easily accessible screening test can be valuable in the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The Dutch National Hearing Foundation developed 'Earcheck', an internet-based speech-in-noise test, presenting CVC-words in stationary broadband noise. However, its sensitivity to detect NIHL appeared to be low, 51% ( Leensen et al, 2011 , part 1). The aim of the current study is to examine ways to improve Earcheck's sensitivity for (early) NIHL using different forms of noise filtering.DESIGN: The test's stationary broadband masking noise is replaced by six alternatives, including noises that have been temporally modulated, spectrally filtered by high-pass or low-pass filters, and combinations of temporal modulation and spectral filtering.STUDY SAMPLE: In this multi-centre study, 49 normal-hearing and 49 subjects with different degrees of NIHL participated.RESULTS: Hearing-impaired subjects deviated more clearly from normal performance when executing the test with alternative masking noises, except for the high-pass filtered conditions. Earcheck with low-pass filtered noise made the best distinction between normal hearing and NIHL, without reducing test reliability. The use of this noise condition improved the sensitivity of Earcheck to 95%.CONCLUSION: The use of low-pass filtered masking noise makes speech-in-noise tests more sensitive to detect NIHL in an early stage."
"21959117","Hearing status among aircraft maintenance personnel in a commercial airline company.","The aim was to study subjective and objective hearing loss in a population of aircraft maintenance workers and identify predictors. A total of 327 aircraft maintenance personnel answered a self-administered work environment questionnaire (response rate 76%) and underwent audiometric test. The mean values for the hearing threshold at 3, 4, and 6 kHz for the ear with the most hearing loss were compared with a Swedish population database of persons not occupationally exposed to noise. Equivalent noise exposure during a working day was measured. Relationships between subjective and objective hearing loss and possible predictors (age, years of employment, self-reported exposure to solvents, blood pressure, and psycho-social factors) were analyzed by multiple logistic regression. At younger ages (&lt;40 years), aircraft maintenance workers had higher hearing thresholds (1-3 dB) compared to the reference group, but such a difference was not found in older employees. Relationships were found between age and objective hearing loss, and between exposure to solvents and reported subjective hearing loss. Equivalent noise exposure during working days were 70-91 dB(A) with a maximal noise level of 119 dB(A). Aircraft maintenance workers are exposed to equivalent noise levels above the Swedish occupational standard, including some very high peak exposures. Younger employees have a higher age-matched hearing threshold level compared with a reference group. Thus, there is a need for further preventive measures."
"21959115","Hearing impairment among workers exposed to excessive levels of noise in ginning industries.","Cotton ginning workers have a risk of hearing loss due to excessive noise levels at the workplace environment. In this study, estimates of typical sound levels prevailing at the workplace environment and its effects on hearing ability of the exposed workers were made among cotton ginning workers. Data on self-reported health status was collected by a questionnaire survey at 10 cotton ginning industries located at Jalgaon district of Maharashtra state, India. The cotton ginning workers were exposed to continuous noise levels between 89 and 106 dBA. The hearing ability of the subjects was accessed by pure tone audiometry. The results of audiometry show mild, moderate and moderately severe degree of hearing impairment among the cotton ginning workers. The data generated during the study show that hearing loss was significantly associated with period of exposure to the workplace noise (P &lt;0.0001). The prevalence of audiometric hearing impairment defined as a threshold average greater than 25 dB hearing level was 96% for binaural low-frequency average, 97% for binaural mid frequency average and 94% for binaural high-frequency average in the cotton ginning workers. We recommend the compulsory use of personal protective equipment like ear plug by the cotton ginning workers at the workplace environment. A regular maintenance of ginning and pressing machineries will avoid the emission of excessive noise at the workplace environment of cotton gins. A regular periodic medical examination is necessary to measure the impact of workplace noise on the health of cotton ginning workers."
"21959114","Prevalence of hearing loss and accuracy of self-report among factory workers.","Noise represents one of the most common occupational health hazards. A Healthy People 2020 objective aims to reduce hearing loss in the noise-exposed public. The purpose of this study was to describe and compare perceived and measured hearing, and to determine the prevalence of hearing loss among a group of factory workers. Data collected as part of an intervention study promoting hearing protector use among workers at an automotive factory in the Midwest were used. Plant employees (n=2691) provided information regarding their perceived hearing ability, work role, and other demographics. The relationships among audiograms, a single-item measure of perceived hearing ability, and demographic data were explored using chi-square, McNemar's test, Mann-Whitney U-test, sensitivity, and specificity. The prevalence of hearing loss among noise-exposed factory workers was 42% (where hearing loss was defined as &gt;25 dB loss at the OSHA-recommended frequencies of 2, 3, and 4 kHz in either ear). However, 76% of workers reported their hearing ability as excellent or good. The difference in perceived hearing ability was significant at each tested frequency between those with and without measured hearing loss. Self-reported hearing ability was poorly related to results of audiometry. Although this group of workers was employed in a regulated environment and served by a hearing conservation program, hearing loss was highly prevalent. These findings, together with national prevalence estimates, support the need for evaluation of hearing conservation programs and increased attention to the national goal of reducing adult hearing loss."

"21901696","Interventions to promote the wearing of hearing protection.","BACKGROUND: This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 2, 2006 and previously updated in 2009.Noise-induced hearing loss can be prevented by eliminating or lowering noise exposure levels. Where the source of the noise cannot be eliminated, workers have to rely on hearing protection equipment. Several trials have been conducted to study the effectiveness of interventions to influence the wearing of hearing protection.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to enhance the wearing of hearing protection among persons regularly exposed to high noise levels.SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 1); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 8 April 2011.SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies if they had a randomised design, if they were among noise exposed (&gt; 80 dB(A)) persons, if they included an intervention to promote the wearing of hearing protection (compared to another intervention or no intervention), and if the outcome measured was the amount of use of hearing protection or a proxy measure thereof.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors selected relevant trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.MAIN RESULTS: Seven studies, involving 4670 participants, were included.A computer-based intervention lasting 30 minutes, tailored to the risk of an individual worker, was not found to be more effective than a video providing general information among workers, around 80% of whom already used hearing protection.A four-year school-based hearing loss prevention programme found that the intervention group was twice as likely to wear some kind of hearing protection as the control group that received a baseline hearing test and two additional tests at years two and three.We conducted two meta-analyses for the comparisons 'tailored strategy (the use of communication or other types of interventions that are specific to an individual or a group and aim to change behaviour) versus non-tailored strategy' and 'tailored strategy versus a commercial video on the use of hearing protection' to look at mean percentage use of hearing protective devices (HPDs), that showed improvement in the mean use of HPDs for the tailored group. A meta-analysis of the comparison 'mixed interventions' (classroom instruction, distribution of HPDs, mailings, noise level assessments and audiometric testing) versus control (audiometric testing alone) also showed improvement in self reported use of HPDs when shooting firearms.Tailored education showed an improvement in HPD use of 8.3% versus targeted education (6.1%).AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence found in this review shows that some interventions improve the mean use of hearing protection devices compared to non-intervention. Future trials should have standard outcomes and interventions to allow the combining of results in meta-analysis."
"21873915","Validity of self-rated hearing compared with audiometric measurement among construction workers.","BACKGROUND: A valid assessment of hearing status is important to detect hearing loss early and prevent further loss in noise-exposed individuals or older adults. Self-report is used widely in research and is often the only possible measure to evaluate hearing ability.OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to establish the level of validity of self-rated hearing by comparing it with the results of audiograms and to examine correlations and changes in self-rated and measured hearing status over time.METHODS: Survey and audiogram data collected from 403 construction workers at two different time points (Years 1 and 2) were used in the hearing protection intervention study. Self-rated hearing was assessed on a 5-point rating scale using a single question (&quot;How do you rate your hearing?&quot;). Hearing was measured via audiograms conducted at frequencies 0.5 through 8 kHz. Three pure-tone threshold average (PTA) indicators, PTA 0.5-2 kHz, PTA 0.5-3 kHz, and PTA 4-6 kHz, of the worse ear were used and compared with self-ratings at two time points.RESULTS: Percentage of agreement between the self-rated and measured hearing was lowest in PTA 4-6 kHz and highest in PTA 0.5-3 kHz for both years. Cohen's kappas showed fair to moderate (.25-.45) agreement. Sensitivity was higher (.82-.89) in the speech frequencies and lower (.51-.55) at higher frequencies. Specificity was better at higher frequencies than at lower frequencies (.83-.89 vs .68-.74). Although there was no appreciable change in self-rated hearing and limited change in measured hearing on all 3 indicators from Years 1 to 2, correlations between self-rated and measured hearing were higher in Year 2.DISCUSSION: A single-item question about an individual's hearing ability is moderately useful and valid to assess hearing loss and can be recommended for a population-based study only if audiograms are not available, but self-report hearing screening should not be considered an adequate substitute for the standardized audiometric test. Providing audiograms and feedback on the results apparently enhanced individuals' ability to judge their hearing status."
"21825303","Longitudinal assessment of noise exposure in a cohort of construction workers.","OBJECTIVES: To address questions surrounding noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) from variable noise, we have been evaluating noise exposures and changes in hearing in a prospective cohort of construction workers (representing eight trades) and controls. In this paper, we develop and explore several long-term exposure estimates for cohort members.METHODS: We followed cohort members between 1999 and 2009 and interviewed them approximately annually to obtain a detailed work history for the previous subject-interval while also collecting tests of hearing sensitivity. Over the same period, we also collected a sample of full-shift average noise measurements and activity information. We used data from these two sources to develop various exposure estimates for each subject for specific subject intervals and for the duration of the study. These estimates included work duration, trade-mean (TM)-equivalent continuous exposure level (L(EQ)), task-based (TB) L(EQ), a hybrid L(EQ) combining TB and subjective information, and an estimate of noise exposure 'peakiness'.RESULTS: Of the 456 subjects enrolled in the study, 333 had at least 2 interviews and met several inclusion criteria related to hearing sensitivity. Depending on the metric used, between one-third and three-quarters of 1310 measured full-shift noise exposures exceeded permissible and recommended exposure limits. Hybrid and TB exposure estimates demonstrated much greater variability than TM estimates. Work duration and estimates of exposure peakiness showed poor agreement with average exposures, suggesting that these metrics evaluate different aspects of exposure and may have different predictive value for estimating NIHL.CONCLUSIONS: Construction workers in the cohort had subject-interval and study-average exposures which present a substantial potential risk of NIHL. In a subsequent paper, we will use these estimates to evaluate the exposure-response relationship between noise and NIHL."
"21822855","Audiological implications of earplugs used for the prevention of aural exostoses.","External auditory canal exostoses may be a preventable disease, so it is surprising that the regular use of water precautions is not greater among surfers. One reason for this is the impairment of hearing whilst wearing earplugs. The objective of this study is to establish the hearing impairment of commonly available earplugs used by surfers. Staff and patients with normal hearing were recruited to have pure tone audiometry performed multiple times, initially with no earplugs, and subsequently with earplugs. Three earplug types were tested which differed in their nature and material (prefabricated elastomer, custom-fitted silicone, and custom-fitted acrylic). Vented and non-vented forms of the earplugs were tested. 30 normal hearing ears were included. Two-tailed paired t-tests comparing hearing thresholds between different earplugs identified that the elastomer earplugs caused the least hearing impairment (p &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference in hearing thresholds between vented and non-vented elastomer earplugs (p = 0.148), but the difference between vented and non-vented forms of other earplugs was statistically significant (silicone p = 0.010, acrylic p = 0.018). Prefabricated ear plugs produce less hearing impairment than other commonly available earplugs. A customised earplug made of hard material causes the greatest impairment of hearing. We therefore recommend that for aquatic sports where hearing is important, a soft prefabricated earplug is preferable."

Specific diagnoses of otological and audiological disorders, which can result in hearing loss, were searched for.DESIGN: A retrospective register study.STUDY SAMPLE: Three age cohorts, 474 70- and 75-year olds (&quot;younger&quot;), and 252 85-year olds (&quot;older&quot;), were studied. Clinical pure tone and speech audiometry was used. Data from medical files were included.RESULTS: Conductive hearing loss was diagnosed in 6.1% of the &quot;younger&quot; elderly persons, and in 10.3% of the &quot;older&quot; ones. Specific diagnoses (chronic otitis media and otosclerosis) were established in about half of the cases. Sensorineural hearing loss, other than age-related hearing loss and noise induced hearing loss, was diagnosed in 3.4 % and 5.2% respectively. Severely impaired speech recognition, possibly reflecting age-related auditory neuropathy, was found in 0.4% in the &quot;younger&quot; group, and in 10% in the &quot;older&quot; group. Bilateral functional deafness was present in 3.2% of the 85-year-old persons, but was not present in the 70-75-year group.CONCLUSION: The incidence of probable age-related auditory neuropathy increases considerably from 70-75 to 85 years. There are marked differences between &quot;younger&quot; and &quot;older&quot; elderly persons regarding hearing loss that severely affects oral communication."
"21812635","A multicenter study on the audiometric findings of styrene-exposed workers.","OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate hearing loss among workers exposed to styrene, alone or with noise.DESIGN: This cross-sectional study was conducted as part of NoiseChem, a European Commission 5th Framework Programme research project, by occupational health institutes in Finland, Sweden, and Poland.STUDY SAMPLE: Participants' ages ranged from 18-72 years (n = 1620 workers). Participants exposed to styrene, alone or with noise, were from reinforced fiberglass products manufacturing plants (n = 862). Comparison groups were comprised of workers noise-exposed (n = 400) or controls (n = 358). Current styrene exposures ranged from 0 to 309 mg/m(3), while mean current noise levels ranged from 70-84 dB(A). Hearing thresholds of styrene-exposed participants were compared with Annexes A and B from ANSI S3.44, 1996.RESULTS: The audiometric thresholds of styrene exposed workers were significantly poorer than those in published standards. Age, gender, and styrene exposure met the significance level criterion in the multiple logistic regression for the binary outcome 'hearing loss' (P = 0.0000). Exposure to noise (&lt;85 dBA p = 0.0001; =85 dB(A) p = 0.0192) interacted significantly with styrene exposure.CONCLUSIONS: Occupational exposure to styrene is a risk factor for hearing loss, and styrene-exposed workers should be included in hearing loss prevention programs."
"21802644","Dichotic multiple-frequency auditory steady-state responses in evaluating the hearing thresholds of occupational noise-exposed workers.","An objective, fast, and reasonably accurate assessment test that allows for easy interpretation of the responses of the hearing thresholds at all frequencies of a conventional audiogram is needed to resolve the medicolegal aspects of an occupational hearing injury. This study evaluated the use of dichotic multiple-frequency auditory steady-state responses (Mf-ASSR) to predict the hearing thresholds in workers exposed to high levels of noise. The study sample included 34 workers with noise-induced hearing impairment. Thresholds of pure-tone audiometry (PTA) and Mf-ASSRs at four frequencies were assessed. The differences and correlations between the thresholds of Mf-ASSRs and PTA were determined. The results showed that, on average, Mf-ASSR curves corresponded well with the thresholds of the PTA contours averaged across subjects. The Mf-ASSRs were 208dB, 169dB, 129dB, and 1112dB above the thresholds of the PTA for 500Hz, 1,000Hz, 2,000Hz, and 4,000Hz, respectively. The thresholds of the PTA and the Mf-ASSRs were significantly correlated (r=0.77-0.89). We found that the measurement of Mf-ASSRs is easy and potentially time saving, provides a response at all dichotic multiple frequencies of the conventional audiogram, reduces variability in the interpretation of the responses, and correlates well with the behavioral hearing thresholds in subjects with occupational noise-induced hearing impairment. Mf-ASSR can be a valuable aid in the adjustment of compensation cases."
"21800245","[Hearing loss in adolescents due to leisure noise. The OHRKAN study].","Alarming reports have been published about hearing loss in adolescents, and increasing leisure time noise exposure has been blamed. If the exposure limits from the Noise at Work Regulations are applied, discotheque music as well as music from portable music players are associated with the risk of hearing loss. The empirical evidence for this association, however, is not sufficient. Not even an increase in the prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss among adolescents can be documented. OHRKAN is a prospective cohort study aimed to produce information on the prevalence of hearing loss as well as its risk factors in adolescents. Currently, a total of 2,240 pupils in grade 9at schools in the city of Regensburg, Germany, have been recruited. Data on noise exposure were collected using standardized questionnaires. In addition, hearing status was assessed by medical examination including tympanometry, audiometry, and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions. Developments in noise exposure as well as hearing status will be assessed in follow-up data collections. Independent of this empirical assessment preventive measures are already needed now to reduce the risk of hearing loss in adolescents and young adults."
"21786748","Effects of gene-environmental interaction on noise-induced hearing threshold levels for high frequencies (HTLHF).","In this study we assessed the interaction between glutathione S-transferase (GST) genetic polymorphisms and noise exposures, with regard to their effect on the hearing threshold levels for high frequencies (HTLHF). Research participants comprised 347 male workers, and each participant's cumulative noise exposure was determined using a job-exposure matrix. Approximately 64.6% of the participants' exposure in L(eq-8 h) was above 90 dBA. The mean HTLHF was 32.1 dB. A significant dose-response relationship was found between noise exposure and HTLHF. We further converted the estimated total noise exposure level over each participant's job history to a noise exposure level that corresponded to a 40-year exposure (L(eq-40y)). After we had adjusted the results for age, we found that workers carrying GSTM1 null, GSTT1 null, and GSTP1 Ile(105)/Ile(105) genotypes were susceptible to the HTLHF when their L(eq-40y) were above 90 dBA. Therefore, GST genetic polymorphisms might affect HTLHF only when workers are exposed to high noise levels."
"21782007","The effects of chronic tinnitus caused by acoustic trauma on social behaviour and anxiety in rats.","Tinnitus is associated with significant increases in anxiety disorders in humans, which is thought to affect social interaction; however, there has been only one previous study of the effects of tinnitus on social interaction in animals treated with salicylate and no previous study of the effects of tinnitus on anxiety in animals. In the present study, we used acoustic trauma to induce tinnitus in rats and investigated its effects on social interaction and anxiety in animals confirmed to have tinnitus. When social behaviours were grouped, we found that animals with tinnitus engaged in significantly more aggressive behaviours toward both tinnitus and sham control animals (P=0.03). When individual social behaviours were analysed without considering whether a tinnitus or sham animal was interacting with a member of its own treatment group, tinnitus animals were found to engage in significantly more anogenital investigation (P=0.01) and significantly less social grooming (P=0.003). When the data were analysed according to whether an animal was interacting with a member of its own group, tinnitus animals were found to bite sham animals significantly more than other tinnitus animals (P=0.005). Sham animals also bit tinnitus animals significantly more than other sham animals (P=0.02), as well as climbing away from them more (P=0.04), kicking (P=0.003), nudging them more (P=0.04), and sleeping with them more (P=0.02). By contrast, sham animals sniffed tinnitus animals significantly less than sham animals (P=0.05). There were no significant differences between the sham and tinnitus animals in performance in the elevated plus and elevated T maze tests of anxiety. However, tinnitus animals displayed a slight but significant increase in locomotor activity in the open field (P=0.04). These data suggest that tinnitus results in complex changes in social interaction in rats, which are not due simply to increases in anxiety."

They were all exposed to noise over the risk-limits from weapons and vehicles and used earmuffs and/or earplugs. Questionnaires and pure tone screening audiometry were studied at the start and the end of the military service. Retrospective information regarding audiometry at conscription before military service was included as control. The prevalence values of tinnitus were 23% before and 32% after the service and of sensitivity to noise 16% and 19% respectively. The prevalence values of hearing impairment were 6.3% at conscription, 14.5% at reporting to military service, and 24% after the training period. The incidence values of hearing decline were 3.7% during the period with no military noise exposure and 6.6% during the military service. Acoustic accident increased the risk of worsened tinnitus and sensitivity to noise four times and for a high frequency hearing decline six times. We observed elevated prevalence values of tinnitus, sensitivity to noise and hearing impairment at discharge compared to before military service. We observed an elevated risk of hearing decline during military service. Acoustic accident increased the risk of tinnitus, noise sensitivity and hearing decline. We suggest improvements regarding inclusion criteria for military service, and for education regarding the HCP."

The methods that have been proposed are based on two principles: the morphological evaluation of the audiometric curve (eg. Merluzzi-Pira-Bosio--MPB) or the average hearing loss on different frequencies (eg. Albera-Beatrice--AB). The purpose of this study was to classify audiograms compatible with chronic acoustic trauma performed at the Occupational Medicine Outpatient Clinic of CTO Hospital in Turin from 2004 to 2011 with the methods outlined in Guidelines published by SIMLII. A substantial agreement among the methods was observed.

"21708356","Nutrient plasma levels achieved during treatment that reduces noise-induced hearing loss.","Hearing loss encompasses both temporary and permanent deficits. If temporary threshold shift (TTS) and permanent threshold shift (PTS) share common pathological mechanisms, then agents that reduce PTS also should reduce TTS. Several antioxidant agents have reduced PTS in rodent models; however, reductions in TTS have been inconsistent. This study first determined whether dietary antioxidants (beta-carotene and vitamins C and E) delivered in combination with magnesium (Mg) reliably increase plasma concentrations of the active agents. Then, additional manipulations tested the hypothesis that these nutrients reduce acute TTS insult in the first 24 h after loud sound as well as longer lasting changes in hearing measured up to 7 days postnoise. Saline or nutrients were administered to guinea pigs prior to and after noise exposure. Sound-evoked electrophysiological responses were measured before noise, with tests repeated 1-h postnoise, as well as 1-day, 3-days, 5-days, and 7-days postnoise. All subjects showed significant functional recovery; subjects treated with nutrients recovered more rapidly and had better hearing outcomes at early postnoise times as well as the final test time. Thus, this combination of nutrients, which produced significant increases in plasma concentrations of vitamins C and E and Mg, effectively reduced hearing loss at multiple postnoise times. These data suggest that free radical formation contributes to TTS as well as PTS insults and suggest a potential opportunity to prevent TTS in human populations."
"21695357","Evidence of noise-induced hearing loss in young people studying popular music.","The number of students studying popular music, music technology, and sound engineering courses at both school and university to has increased rapidly in the last few years. These students are generally involved in music-making/recording and listening to a high level, usually in environments with amplified music. Recent studies have shown that these students are potentially exposed to a high risk of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL( and are not covered by the same regulatory framework as employees. This study examined the pure tone air conduction hearing thresholds of 50 undergraduate students, including recent school leavers, on a range of popular music courses, to assess if there was evidence of hearing loss. Forty-four percent of students showed evidence of audiometric notch at 4-6 kHz, and 16% were classified under the UK Occupational Health and Safety guidelines as exhibiting mild hearing loss. Instance of audiometric notch was considerably higher than reported from studies of the general population but was around the same level or lower than that reported from studies of &quot;traditional&quot; music courses and conservatoires, suggesting no higher risk for popular music students than for &quot;classical&quot; music students. No relationship with age was present, suggesting that younger students were as likely to exhibit audiometric notch as mature students. This indicates that these students may be damaging their hearing through leisure activities while still at school, suggesting a need for robust education measures to focus on noise exposure of young people."

A case report].","BACKGROUND: Mnire's syndrome appears to be the final common pathway of the mechanisms the inner ear responds to almost any injury. Although the autoimmune disease seems to play a major role, exposure to intense noise can also be a trigger in the appearance and/or aggravation of the disease.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The case of 41 years old musician with a history of ankylosing spondylitis, diagnosed with Mnire's syndrome 5 years ago, is presented. Recently the symptoms became more polymorphic, revealing the association between benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Mnire's syndrome and high frequency hearing loss in an autoimmune background. Besides general, neurological and ENT examination, the diagnostic workup comprised of tonal audiogram, brain stem auditory evoked potentials, computerized dynamic posturography and videonistagmography.RESULTS: The final diagnosis was acute noise trauma, Mnire's syndrome, left horizontal semicircular canal BPPV, bilateral sensorineural sudden aggravated hearing loss in high frequencies (above 9 kHz) and allegedly autoimmune inner ear disease. Treatment with an association of corticosteroids, vasodilators and vitamins combined with Vannucchi's maneuver were followed by a significant relief of the symptoms.CONCLUSION: Although no causal relationship was found between acoustic trauma and increased endolymphatic pressure, both literature data and the case presented show that intense and prolonged noise exposure may aggravate peripheral vestibular syndrome."
"21682404","Is it necessary to penalize impulsive noise +5 dB due to higher risk of hearing damage?","It is studied whether the +5 dB penalty for impulsiveness established by ISO 1999:1990 accounts for a higher risk of noise-induced hearing loss. A total of 16 normal-hearing human subjects were exposed for 10 min to two types of binaural industrial-recordings: (1) a continuous broad-band noise normalized to L(EX,8 h)=80 dBA and (2) the combination of the previous stimulus with an impulsive noise normalized to L(EX,8 h)=75+5(db penalty)=80 dBA (peak level 117 dBC and repetition rate of 0.5 impacts per second). Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were measured in a broad frequency range before and in the following 90 min after the exposure. The group results show that the continuous exposure had a bigger impact on DPOAE levels, with a maximum DPOAE shift of approximately 5 dB in the frequency range of 2-3.15 kHz during the first 10 min of the recovery. No evident DPOAE shift is seen for the impulsive + continuous stimulus. The results indicate that the penalty overestimated the effects on DPOAE levels and support the concept that the risk of hearing loss from low-level impulses may be predicted on an equal-energy basis."
"21674401","Audiometric thresholds and prevalence of tinnitus among male veterans in the United States: data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2006.","Hearing loss and tinnitus are the two most prevalent service-connected disabilities among U.S. veterans. The number of veterans receiving compensation and services from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for these conditions continues to increase annually. However, the majority of veterans in the United States do not use VA medical centers or clinics for healthcare and do not receive VA compensation payments. Therefore, the prevalence of hearing loss and tinnitus among U.S. veterans is unknown. This study used National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data to estimate the prevalence of these auditory conditions among male veterans. Between 1999 and 2006, pure tone audiometric data collected from 845 male veterans were compared with pure tone thresholds collected from 2,086 male nonveterans. We used questionnaire data collected between 1999 and 2004 to calculate and compare the prevalence of tinnitus for 2,174 veterans and 4,995 nonveterans. In general, pure tone thresholds did not differ significantly between veterans and nonveterans for most frequencies tested (500-8,000 Hz). The overall prevalence of tinnitus was greater for veterans than that for nonveterans (p &lt; 0.001), with statistically significant differences in the 50 to 59 and 60 to 69 age groups."

Data were available for 89/99 right/left ears on enlistment and 99/100 for LGV. Mean time between examinations was 4.1 years (range 1.4-12.6 years). By the LGV examination, there was deterioration in 69/99 right and 77/100 left ears, with the hearing loss in 8% of right and 13% of left ears falling into the 'warning' or 'referral' categories (Control of Noise at Work Regulations 2005) compared with 1% at enlistment. These differences reached statistical significance (P &lt; 0.05 and &lt; 0.001, respectively)CONCLUSIONS: Statistically significant hearing losses occur in some firefighters during the early stages of their careers. Further work needs to be done to establish if this continues, and steps taken to reduce the noise hazard at work."
"21617964","Determination of noise induced hearing loss in mining: an application of hierarchical loglinear modelling.","The levels of noise arise from mining industry seem to be higher when compared to other industries. For this reason, noise exposure and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) are prevalent in mining. Assessment of noise emission levels that arise from various mining operations is required to prevent and minimize the NIHL. Because the studies for preventing occupational hearing loss among miners are inadequate, a quarry and stone crushing-screening plant was selected to generate site-specific data. The noise levels of the environments in which workers work were measured and also a hearing test centre applied hearing tests to the workers. According to the hearing test results, it was determined that the part of workers have hearing loss. The main factors affecting the NIHL were assumed as experience, noise level, miners' age and occupation, and by taking into account the sub factors of the main factors, multi way contingency tables were prepared. Then hierarchical loglinear analysis method was implemented to categorized data; thus, the probabilities might effect NIHL was investigated. At the end of this study, it was found that the most risky occupation group was the drivers, and additionally, these workers were mostly exposed to 70-79dB(A) noise level. When the important interactions are evaluated, it is determined that 4-11years experienced crusher workers have high probability of NIHL because of high exposure to 90-99dB(A) noise level. Moreover, the most important interactions which may affect the NIHL were identified and the precautions to reduce hearing loss were presented."
"21419067","Some observations on the nature of the audiometric 4000hz notch: data from 3430 veterans.","BACKGROUND: Pure-tone, air-conduction audiograms notched at 4000 Hz have long been considered the signature configuration for noise-induced hearing loss even though there is an extensive literature that does not mesh with this simple explanation. There are many reports of notched audiograms from individuals with no history of noise exposure and, conversely, reports of audiograms with no notches from individuals with a history of noise exposure. Recent reports increasingly suggest that unilateral 4000 Hz notches are common. The prevalence of notched audiograms at 4000 Hz is dependent on the definition of the notch and the population under study.PURPOSE: To examine the prevalence and characteristics of audiograms that are notched at 4000 Hz.RESEARCH DESIGN: Retrospective, descriptive.STUDY SAMPLE: The participants were 3430 veterans evaluated in the Audiology Clinic at the VA Medical Center, Mountain Home, Tennessee. The mean age was 62.3 yr. Data Collection and Analyses: The data were collected in the course of a 60 min, routine audiological evaluation. In addition to pure-tone audiometry, a history, otoscopy, speech audiometry in quiet and in noise, and aural-acoustic immittance measures were included in the clinic protocol but were not evaluated in this report. A notch was defined when the 4000 Hz threshold minus the 2000 Hz threshold and the 4000 Hz threshold minus the 8000 Hz threshold both were =10 dB.RESULTS: Overall the mean LE (left ear) thresholds at 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz were at hearing levels 2-3 dB higher than the hearing levels for the corresponding mean RE (right ear) thresholds; the differences were significant. A notched audiogram was observed in 40.6% of the participants in at least one ear with 15.4% having bilateral notches, 28.8% LE notches, and 27.1% RE notches. Unilateral 4000 Hz notches were almost twice as prevalent as bilateral 4000 Hz notches. Viewed as a function of age, notched audiograms were most common (~35% of the participants) in the 40 and 50 yr groups with a diminishing prevalence in the 60-80 yr groups. The mean notch depth at 4000 Hz was consistently 20-26 dB across the seven age groups. In comparison to the thresholds of the audiograms that were not notched, the thresholds of the audiograms with 4000 Hz notches (1) at 250-2000 Hz were at hearing levels 2-3 dB lower, (2) at 3000 and 4000 Hz were at hearing levels 8-17 dB higher, and (3) at 8000 Hz were at hearing levels 3-4 dB lower; the threshold differences were significant at all frequencies for both ears.CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that unilateral, 4000 Hz notched audiograms are as common or more common than bilateral notched audiograms and that unilateral notched audiograms are equally common for the LE and RE. The prevalence and characteristics of 4000 Hz notched audiograms in this veteran sample are similar to those observed in the population as a whole."

"21407078","Speech intelligibility and passive, level-dependent earplugs.","OBJECTIVES: Noise-induced hearing loss is one of the most common occupational diseases. Military personnel are at especially high risk due to the broad range of military noise hazards and the frequency of exposure. Hearing protectors are vital for this particular workforce, yet they can impede the ability to understand necessary communication in the field. Level-dependent hearing protectors are designed to protect the auditory system from the hazards of impulse noise, while preserving the ability to hear speech and other important auditory signals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of two different passive, level-dependent earplugs (Combat Arms Earplugs; Sonic II Ear valves) on speech understanding of normal-hearing listeners in the presence of low-level background noise. The Combat Arms Earplug, developed specifically for use by military personnel, represented devices that attenuate impulse noise using small orifices and the Sonic II ear valve represented devices using an internal diaphragm.DESIGN: This study used a repeated-measures experimental design. Four scrambled lists of each of the four Northwestern University No. 6 50-word lists were presented in random order at 65 dB SPL in the presence of quiet and two different types of background noise: multitalker and military vehicle noise; using three ear conditions: NP (open ear), CA (Combat Arms Earplugs), and SO (Sonic II earplugs); and three signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs): -10, 0, and +10 dB. Word recognition scores (WRSs) of 18 native English-speaking adults with normal hearing sensitivity were measured in all test conditions. The percentage of words correctly repeated was used to determine differences between the two different level-dependent devices, types of background noise, and SNRs.RESULTS: Results showed a statistically significant increase in WRS as SNR increased from -10 to +10 dB. A repeated-measures analysis of variance for ear condition  noise  SNR indicated a significant main effect for SNR but not for type of noise or ear condition. A slight but significant interaction was found for SNR and ear condition.CONCLUSIONS: SNR had great impact on the ability of listeners to understand speech in the presence of background noise; however, the type of noise and the type of level-dependent device used did not. The results of the study support the notion that individuals potentially subjected to high-level impulse noise should be able to use level-dependent earplugs in low-level continuous noise without compromising speech understanding. More specifically, the passive, level-dependent earplugs currently used by military personnel do not appear to be detrimental to speech communication for listeners with normal hearing when the speech is at an average conversational level and the listener is actively attending to the signal."
"21388780","[Occupational noise induced hearing loss acknowledgement: Opinions of a regional occupational disease commission].","CONTEXT: In France, occupational noise-induced hearing loss is compensated by the &quot;Rgime Gnral&quot; of the French Social Security according to the system of the tables of occupational diseases. If administrative and/or exposure criteria are lacking, the regional occupational disease commission (CRRMP) is seized to pronounce an opinion - favourable or not - on the direct link between occupational activity and the deafness.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at determining the decisive factors in this opinion.METHODS: An exhaustive retrospective investigation analysed conclusions of CRRMP of the region Provence-Alpes-Cte d'Azur-Corsica related to the noise-induced hearing loss declarations emitted anonymously between January 1st, 2005 and December 31st, 2007. Favourable and unfavourable opinions were listed then cross-examined against the sociodemographics data of the employees, areas of expertise of the physicians at the origin of the initial medical certificate, grounds for submission to the commission, the occupational physician's opinion on the occupational origin, the results of the engineering consultant's investigation, the audiogram of the first observation of injury and those made in period of noise exposure.RESULTS: One hundred and twenty conclusions were analyzed. Claimants, typically male, 59-year-old on average, mainly came from the sectors of the metal industry (46.7%), transportation (20.8%) and building and civil engineering works (15.8%). All in all, 57.5% of the declarations were refused. These refusals were mainly connected to an opinion unfavourable, unexploitable or absent in the occupational physician, an overrun of the care period when it lasted 5 years and more and the absence of hearing deficit during the exposure.PERSPECTIVES: The results of our study lead to recommend the implementation of a certificate of noise exposure and the realization of an audiogram at the end of exposure to reduce the number of badly informed files and bring an answer more adapted to the demands of occupational noise-induced hearing loss acknowledgements."

"21368442","Development and validation of a field microphone-in-real-ear approach for measuring hearing protector attenuation.","Numerous studies have shown that the reliability of using laboratory measurements to predict individual or even group hearing protector attenuation for occupationally exposed workers is quite poor. This makes it difficult to properly assign hearing protectors when one wishes to closely match attenuation to actual exposure. An alternative is the use of field-measurement methods, a number of which have been proposed and are beginning to be implemented. We examine one of those methods, namely the field microphone-in-real-ear (F-MIRE) approach in which a dual-element microphone probe is used to measure noise reduction by quickly sampling the difference in noise levels outside and under an earplug, with appropriate adjustments to predict real-ear attenuation at threshold (REAT). We report on experiments that validate the ability of one commercially available F-MIRE device to predict the REAT of an earplug fitted identically for two tests. Results are reported on a representative roll-down foam earplug, stemmed-style pod plug, and pre-molded earplug, demonstrating that the 95% confidence level of the Personal Attenuation Rating (PAR) as a function of the number of fits varies from  4.4 dB to  6.3 dB, depending on the plug type, which can be reduced to  3.1 dB to  4.5 dB with a single repeat measurement. The added measurement improves precision substantially. However, the largest portion of the error is due to the user's fitting variability and not the uncertainty of the measurement system. Further we evaluated the inherent uncertainty of F-MIRE vs. the putative &quot;gold standard&quot; REAT procedures finding, that F-MIRE measurement uncertainty is less than one-half that of REAT at most test frequencies. An American National Standards Institute (ANSI) working group (S12/WG11) is currently involved in developing methods similar to those in this paper so that procedures for evaluating and reporting uncertainty on all types of field attenuation measurement systems can be standardized. We conclude that the hearing conservationist now has available a portable, convenient, quick, and easy-to-use system that can improve training and motivation of employees, assign hearing protection devices based on noise exposures, and address other management and compliance issues."

Nave subjects were recruited and tested using three different forms of training: written, video, and individual training. The group averages for A-weighted attenuation were not statistically significant when compared between the video or the written instruction conditions, regardless of presentation order. The experimenter-trained A-weighted attenuations were significantly greater than the written and video instruction for most of the protectors and groups. For each earplug, the noise reduction statistic for A-weighting (NRS A ) and the associated confidence intervals were calculated for the 80 th and 20 th percentiles of protection. Across subject groups for each protector, the differences between NRS A ratings were found to be not statistically significant. Several comparisons evaluating the order of testing, the type of testing, and statistical tests of the performance across the groups are presented."

This training was paired with audiometry and counseling and a survey of attitudes and beliefs in hearing loss prevention. All participants received hearing tests, multimedia instruction on occupational noise exposure/hearing loss, and instruction and practice in using a diverse selection of hearing protection devices (HPDs). A total of 103 apprentice carpenters participated in the Year 1 training, were given a large supply of these HPDs, and instructions on how to get additional free supplies if they ran out during the 1-year interval between initial and follow-up training. Forty-two participants responded to the survey a second time a year later and completed the Year 2 training. Significant test-retest differences were found between the pre-training and the post-training survey scores. Both forms of instruction (individual versus group) produced equivalent outcomes. The results indicated that training was able to bring all apprentice participants up to the same desired level with regard to attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral intentions to use hearing protection properly. It was concluded that the health communication models used to develop the educational and training materials for this effort were extremely effective."

This review discusses pharmacological strategies to attenuate NIHL that have been developed in animal models and that are now beginning to be tested in field trials.AREAS COVERED: The review describes the epidemiology, pathology and pathophysiology of NIHL in experimental animals and humans. The underlying molecular mechanisms of damage are then discussed as a basis for therapeutic approaches to ameliorate the loss of auditory function. Finally, studies in military, industrial and recreational settings are evaluated. Literature was searched using the terms 'noise-induced hearing loss' and 'noise trauma'.EXPERT OPINION: NIHL, in principle, can be prevented. With the current pace of development, oral drugs to protect against NIHL should be available within the next 5-10 years. Positive results from ongoing trials combined with additional laboratory tests might accelerate the time from the bench to clinical treatment."

Temporary threshold shifts following MRI examination have been reported for MRI with lower field strength. Such effect, however, have not been reported so far for a 3T MRI. We report a case that exemplifies the possible detrimental effects of a 3 T MRI generated noise on the auditory system. Our patient underwent investigation of his chronic backache in a 3 T MRI unit and developed hearing loss and tinnitus post-MRI examination. Hearing assessment was done using pure tone audiogram, distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) and brainstem electrical response audiometry (BERA) which revealed a unilateral sensorineural hearing loss which recovered within 3 days. However the tinnitus persisted. This is possibly a case of temporary threshold shift following noise exposure. However a sudden sensorineural hearing loss remains the other possibility."
"21203771","A retrospective analysis of noise-induced hearing loss in the Dutch construction industry.","PURPOSE: Noise exposure is an important and highly prevalent occupational hazard in the construction industry. This study examines hearing threshold levels of a large population of Dutch construction workers and compares their hearing thresholds to those predicted by ISO-1999.METHODS: In this retrospective study, medical records of periodic occupational health examinations of 29,644 construction workers are analysed. Pure-tone audiometric thresholds of noise-exposed workers are compared to a non-exposed control group and to ISO-1999 predictions. Regression analyses are conducted to explore the relationship between hearing loss and noise intensity, noise exposure time and the use of hearing protection.RESULTS: Noise-exposed workers had greater hearing losses compared to their non-noise-exposed colleagues and to the reference population reported in ISO-1999. Noise exposure explained only a small proportion of hearing loss. When the daily noise exposure level rose from 80 dB(A) towards 96 dB(A), only a minor increase in hearing loss is shown. The relation of exposure time and hearing loss found was similar to ISO-1999 predictions when looking at durations of 10 years or more. For the first decade, the population medians show poorer hearing than predicted by ISO-1999.DISCUSSION: Duration of noise exposure was a better predictor than noise exposure levels, probably because of the limitations in noise exposure estimations. In this population, noise-induced hearing loss was already present at the beginning of employment and increased at the same rate as is predicted for longer exposure durations."
"21198988","Rapid increases of gamma power in the auditory cortex following noise trauma in humans.","Tinnitus is an auditory perception in the absence of any external sound source. It has been suggested that tinnitus is related to enhanced synchronization of neuronal activity in the auditory cortex. Usually a hearing damage can be identified suggesting auditory deprivation to central auditory regions to be fundamental for neurophysiological processes related to tinnitus. Until now, human research has been conducted on patients with chronic tinnitus (&gt;6 months). However, neuronal activity accompanying auditory deprivation and putatively tinnitus may not remain constant over time, making it difficult to directly relate outcomes of current animal studies (acute tinnitus) to chronic tinnitus in humans, and vice versa. We investigated 14 amateur rock musicians who frequently reported a short-term tinnitus immediately after band practice. Magnetoencephalographic resting-state recordings, audiometry and tinnitus testing were performed at two separate occasions: with and without previous exposure to loud music. Analyses revealed that transient tinnitus was accompanied by temporary hearing loss in both ears and increased gamma activity in the right auditory cortex in 13 out of 14 cases. Additionally, tinnitus frequency was strongly correlated to hearing loss. Analogous to animal studies, our results show for the first time in humans that noise trauma leads rapidly to increased neuronal synchrony in the auditory cortex. Importantly, the strongly right-lateralized effect implies that it does not reflect tinnitus percept per se. This could rather have been triggered by greater discontinuities of hearing loss at high frequencies that were particularly pronounced in the left ear."
"21193566","Effect of daily noise exposure monitoring on annual rates of hearing loss in industrial workers.","OBJECTIVES: Occupational noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is prevalent, yet evidence on the effectiveness of preventive interventions is lacking. The effectiveness of a new technology allowing workers to monitor daily at-ear noise exposure was analysed.METHODS: Workers in the hearing conservation program of an aluminium smelter were recruited because of accelerated rates of hearing loss. The intervention consisted of daily monitoring of at-ear noise exposure and regular feedback on exposures from supervisors. The annual rate of change in high frequency hearing average at 2, 3 and 4 KHz before intervention (2000-2004) and 4 years after intervention (2006-2009) was determined. Annual rates of loss were compared between 78 intervention subjects and 234 controls in other company smelters matched for age, gender and high frequency hearing threshold level in 2005.RESULTS: Individuals monitoring daily noise exposure experienced on average no further worsening of high frequency hearing (average rate of hearing change at 2, 3 and 4 KHz = -0.5 dB/year). Matched controls also showed decelerating hearing loss, the difference in rates between the two groups being significant (p &lt; 0.0001). Analysis of a subset of intervention subjects matched to controls for initial rate of hearing loss showed a similar trend but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.06).CONCLUSION: Monitoring daily occupational noise exposure inside hearing protection with ongoing administrative feedback apparently reduces the risk of occupational NIHL in industrial workers. Longer follow-up of these workers will help determine the significance of the intervention effect. Intervention studies for the prevention of NIHL need to include appropriate control groups."
"23269012","A survey analysis of acoustic trauma related to MR scans.","PURPOSE: The maximum limit of MR scanner noise and necessity of ear protection is defined in the IEC standard (IEC60601-2-33) of MR safety. With improvements in MR scanner performance, pulse sequences generating higher scanning noise have been used clinically. In this study, we investigated the factors significantly related to potential acoustic trauma cases (PATC) after MR examinations. To consider the future direction for MR safety and prevention of acoustic trauma, issues related to noise generation by MR scanners and acoustic trauma were systematically reviewed.METHODS: A statistical analysis was performed using the data set from a survey (n=974) conducted in 2010 by the JSMRM safety committee. Hierarchical clustering analysis was used to extract the characteristics of the responders. With this classification as a reference, tests of independence and a residual analysis were employed to evaluate the factors related to PATC.RESULTS: No significant relationship was observed between the ear protection policy and the incidence or the reported outcome of PATC. While the two main clusters out of the six clusters extracted were associated with who reported the PATC and the confirmation process of the acoustic noise level of MR scanners, no cluster was associated with the frequency of PATC. An absence of PATC was significantly less reported (p=0.03) and more PATC was reported (p=0.04) by facilities with 3T MR systems.DISCUSSION: Although the total frequency was 4 cases, it should be noted that persistent hearing disturbances are a possible consequence of MR examinations. Neither the condition of the subjects nor the ear protection method was significantly related to the probability of PATC, suggesting the difficulty of predicting the potential risk of acoustic trauma. It is recommended to more systematically follow up PATC cases and clarify the risk factors."
"23267007","Consistency of attenuation across multiple fittings of custom and non-custom earplugs.","Hearing protection devices (HPDs) play a significant role in protecting workers from occupational noise-induced hearing loss. Individual HPD fit-testing estimates the amount of protection, or attenuation, that an individual achieves from a given HPD as it is worn. Results from a single fit-test may not be representative of real-world HPD performance over time, however, due to inconsistency in how the individual fits the HPD from time to time. In this study, the effects of HPD type and user training on the consistency of attenuation achieved across multiple fittings were evaluated in a within-subjects design. Attenuation measurements using a real-ear attenuation at threshold procedure were obtained on 30 participants wearing custom-molded and non-custom earplugs. The subjects were initially naive to proper earplug insertion techniques and later received one-on-one training for the second half of the attenuation measurements. Consistency, or reliability, of fit was assessed using (i) the standard deviation of the 'distance to ear mean attenuation', a measure of fitting uncertainty, and (ii) the standard deviation of the attenuation values across multiple fit-tests for each subject. The custom earplug provided statistically significantly better consistency of attenuation than the non-custom earplug at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz. Training effects were statistically significant at 250, 500, and 1000 Hz and at the Personal Attenuation Rating. No interactions were statistically significant. These results indicate that, in general, subjects obtained more consistent attenuation with the custom earplugs than with the non-custom earplugs and that consistency improved with training for both earplug types."

A cross-sectional approach was used in this study. Shift-long temporal waveforms of the noise that workers were exposed to for evaluation of noise exposures and audiometric threshold measures were obtained on all selected subjects. The subjects were exposed to only one occupational noise exposure without the use of hearing protection devices. The results suggest that: (1) the kurtosis metric is an important variable in determining the hazards to hearing posed by a high-level industrial noise environment for hearing conservation purposes, i.e., the kurtosis differentiated between the hazardous effects produced by Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise environments, (2) the ISO-1999 predictive model does not accurately estimate the degree of median NIPTS incurred to high level kurtosis industrial noise, and (3) the inherent large variability in NIPTS among subjects emphasize the need to develop and analyze a larger database of workers with well-documented exposures to better understand the effect of kurtosis on NIPTS incurred from high level industrial noise exposures. A better understanding of the role of the kurtosis metric may lead to its incorporation into a new generation of more predictive hearing risk assessment for occupational noise exposure."
"23257577","Noise-induced hearing loss.","Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) still remains a problem in developed countries, despite reduced occupational noise exposure, strict standards for hearing protection and extensive public health awareness campaigns. Therefore NIHL continues to be the focus of noise research activities. This paper summarizes progress achieved recently in our knowledge of NIHL. It includes papers published between the years 2008-2011 (in English), which were identified by a literature search of accessible medical and other relevant databases. A substantial part of this research has been concerned with the risk of NIHL in the entertainment sector, particularly in professional, orchestral musicians. There are also constant concerns regarding noise exposure and hearing risk in &quot;hard to control&quot; occupations, such as farming and construction work. Although occupational noise has decreased since the early 1980s, the number of young people subject to social noise exposure has tripled. If the exposure limits from the Noise at Work Regulations are applied, discotheque music, rock concerts, as well as music from personal music players are associated with the risk of hearing loss in teenagers and young adults. Several recent research studies have increased the understanding of the pathomechanisms of acoustic trauma, the genetics of NIHL, as well as possible dietary and pharmacologic otoprotection in acoustic trauma. The results of these studies are very promising and offer grounds to expect that targeted therapies might help prevent the loss of sensory hair cells and protect the hearing of noise-exposed individuals. These studies emphasize the need to launch an improved noise exposure policy for hearing protection along with developing more efficient norms of NIHL risk assessment."
"23207014","Contribution of genetic factors to noise-induced hearing loss: a human studies review.","Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a complex disease that results from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Over the last 10 years there has been a great increase in association studies trying to identify the susceptibility genes for NIHL in humans. They were conducted based on the candidate gene approach and comprised predominantly the group of oxidative stress genes, inner ear potassium recycling pathway genes and monogenic deafness genes, as well as other genes. So far, the most promising results were obtained for two genes encoding potassium ion channels (KCNQ4 and KCNE1), catalase (CAT), protocadherin 15 (PCDH15), myosin 14 (MYH14) and heat shock protein (HSP70), because they were replicated in two (Polish and Swedish) or three (Polish, Swedish and Chinese) populations, and were sufficient in size to yield high power for the detection of a causative allele. Today, the development of high-throughput genotyping methods allows the detection of hundreds and thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a single array which undoubtedly will lead toward identification of new NIHL susceptibility genes. This in turn will contribute to the development of genetics tests that would allow for better protection of noise-exposed individuals and personalized treatment, if necessary."
"23198527","Changes in hearing thresholds as measured by decibels of hearing loss in British Army Air Corps lynx and apache pilots.","OBJECTIVE: Helicopter pilots are exposed to noise at work and are at risk of developing hearing loss in excess of that which naturally results from aging. We investigated whether Lynx pilots demonstrated changes to hearing thresholds that differed from Apache pilots.METHODS: Survey responses were combined with audiometric data from a retrospective cohort of 59 Lynx and 87 Apache pilots. Subjects' audiograms were analyzed for air conduction thresholds with age correction performed in accordance with ISO 7029. Annual changes in low frequencies (0.5-2 kHz) and high frequencies (3-6 kHz) were calculated. Subjects were categorized for time in service and flying hours.RESULTS: Hearing was better than predicted at nearly all frequencies in both ears for Lynx and Apache pilots. There were no differences in hearing between groups of pilots. Significant differences in hearing threshold changes existed for pilots with 20 or more years of service compared to those in other categories.DISCUSSION: The results suggest that the circumaural earmuffs currently incorporated into the flying helmet mitigate the risk of noise-induced hearing loss in these pilots."
"23154196","Effects of passive, moderate-level sound exposure on the mature auditory cortex: spectral edges, spectrotemporal density, and real-world noise.","Persistent, passive exposure of adult cats to bandlimited tone pip ensembles or sharply-filtered white noise at moderate levels (~70dB SPL) leads to a long-term suppression of spontaneous and sound-evoked activity in the region(s) of primary auditory cortex (AI) normally tuned to the exposure spectrum, and to an enhancement of activity in one or more neighboring regions of AI, all in the apparent absence of hearing loss. Here, we first examined the effects of passive exposure to a more structured, real-world noise, consisting of a mix of power tool and construction sounds. This &quot;factory noise&quot; had less pronounced effects on adult cat AI than our previous random tone pip ensembles and white noise, and these effects appeared limited to the region of AI tuned to frequencies near the sharp factory noise cutoff at 16kHz. To further investigate the role of sharp spectral edges in passive exposure-induced cortical plasticity, a second group of adult cats was exposed to a tone pip ensemble with a flat spectrum between 2 and 4kHz and shallow cutoff slopes (12dB/oct) on either side. Compared to our previous ensemble with the same power in the 2-4kHz band but very steep slopes, exposure to the overall more intense, sloped stimulus had much weaker effects on AI. Finally, we explored the issue of exposure stimulus spectrotemporal density and found that low aggregate tone pip presentation rates of about one per second sufficed to induce changes in the adult AI similar to those characteristic of our previous, much denser exposures. These results are discussed in light of the putative mechanisms underlying exposure-induced auditory cortical plasticity, and the potential adverse consequences of working or living in moderately noisy environments."

Personal music players' output capabilities and volunteers' preferred output levels were assessed in different settings. Based on current noise-induced hearing loss exposure limits, recommendations were outlined.METHODS: On three different devices and earphone types and 10 music styles, free field equivalent sound pressure output levels were assessed by applying a microphone probe inside the auditory canal. Forty-five hearing-healthy volunteers were asked to select preferred listening levels in different background noise scenarios.RESULTS: Sound pressure output reached 126 dB. No difference was found between device types, whereas earbud and supra-aural earphones showed significantly lower outputs than in-ear earphones (P &lt; .001). Three distinct music style groups were identified with as much as 14.4 dB difference between them. In silence, 17.8% of volunteers spontaneously selected a listening level above 85 dB. With 90 dB background noise, 40% selected a level above 94 dB. Earphone attenuation capability was found to correlate significantly with preferred level reductions (r = 0.585, P &lt; .001). In-ear and especially supra-aural earphones reduced preferred listening levels the most.CONCLUSIONS: Safe-use recommendations were outlined, whereas selecting the lowest volume setting comfortable remained the main suggestion. High background noise attenuating earphones may help in reducing comfortable listening levels and should be preferred. A risk table was elaborated, presenting time limits before reaching a risky exposure."

"22992262","Pure-tone hearing asymmetry: a logistic approach modeling age, sex, and noise exposure history.","BACKGROUND: Asymmetric hearing loss (AHL) can be an early sign of vestibular schwannoma (VS). However, recognizing VS-induced AHL is challenging. There is no universally accepted definition of a &quot;medically significant pure-tone hearing asymmetry,&quot; in part because AHL is a common feature of medically benign forms of hearing loss (e.g., age- or firearm-related hearing loss). In most cases, the determination that an observed AHL does not come from a benign cause involves subjective clinical judgment.PURPOSE: Our purpose was threefold: (1) to quantify hearing asymmetry distributions in a large group of patients with medically benign forms of hearing loss, stratifying for age, sex, and noise exposure history; (2) to assess how previously proposed hearing asymmetry calculations segregate tumor from nontumor cases; and (3) to present the results of a logistic regression method for defining hearing asymmetry that incorporates age, sex, and noise information.RESEARCH DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.STUDY SAMPLE: Five thousand six hundred and sixty-one patients with idiopathic, age- or noise exposure-related hearing loss and 85 untreated VS patients.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Audiometric, patient history, and clinical impression data were collected from 22,785 consecutive patient visits to the audiology section at Mayo Clinic in Florida from 2006 to 2009 to screen for eligibility. Those eligible were then stratified by VS presence, age, sex, and self-reported noise exposure history. Pure-tone asymmetry distributions were analyzed. Audiometric data from VS diagnoses were used to create four additional audiograms per patient to model the hypothetical development of AHL prior to the actual hearing test. The ability of 11 previously defined hearing asymmetry calculations to distinguish between VS and non-VS cases was described. A logistic regression model was developed that integrated age, sex, and noise exposure history with pure-tone asymmetry data. Regression model performance was then compared to existing asymmetry calculation methods.RESULTS: The 11 existing pure-tone asymmetry calculations varied in tumor detection performance. Age, sex, and noise exposure history helped to predict benign forms of hearing asymmetry. The logistic regression model outperformed existing asymmetry calculations and better accounted for normal age-, sex-, and noise exposure-related asymmetry variability.CONCLUSIONS: Our logistic regression asymmetry method improves the clinician's ability to estimate risk of VS, in part by integrating categorical patient history and numeric test data. This form of modeling can enhance clinical decision making in audiology and otology."

"22940166","Effect of recreational noise exposure on hearing impairment among teenage students.","Several studies have focused on the potential impact of children's hearing loss on learning and development. Recently, numerous teenage students have been found to be fond of listening to music on personal devices and participating in recreational music activities. The objective of this study was to investigate teenage students' hearing impairment, their experience with recreational noise exposure, and their self-reported hearing. The participants were 1878 first-year students at a university in Taiwan. The result of the pure tone audiometry test showed that 11.9% of the participants had one or two ears with a hearing threshold over 25 dB. Over the past year, approximately 80.9% of the participants had taken part in at least one loud-noise recreational activity, and 90.9% of the participants were in the habit of using earphones. Among the participants, 190 students with a high level of recreational noise exposure were assigned to the exposure group, and 191 students with a low level of recreational noise exposure constituted the control group. The exposure group had more hearing problems than the control group, but no significant difference existed between the two groups in the pure tone audiometry test (p=0.857). It is suggested that the schools should reinforce hearing health education and proactively provide intervention measures, such as hearing tests, evaluation of noise exposure, and hearing protection."

We did an environmental analysis (spectral analysis) of the noise in companies from different industries, with audiological assessment of 347 workers.RESULTS: The spectral analysis revealed peaks at different frequencies for each industry investigated (8 kHz-metallurgical, 4 kHz-stone Works and 2 kHz-wood works). We noticed that the frequencies of 14 kHz and 16 kHz had significant differences between the various industries, with a greater prevalence of the metallurgical.CONCLUSION: The use of noise pressure measuring device, coupled to a frequency analyzer and high frequency audiometric assessment yielded an early detection of hearing damage, helping better organize preventive measures."

Thirty soldiers served as a control group.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pure tone threshold changes detected by PTA and EFA, amplitude and reproducibility changes in transiently evoked OAE, distortion products, and tinnitus analysis based on a visual analog scale.RESULTS: Assault rifle-induced AAT caused unilateral temporary threshold shifts (TTS) in PTA and bilateral TTS in EFA. Two frequency regions with the largest threshold shifts were identified: one between 3 and 6 kHz and another between 11 and 14 kHz. The reproducibility of transiently evoked OAEs revealed changes related to the acoustic trauma in the 3- to 5-kHz frequency window. The amplitudes of the low stimulation level distortion products at 6 kHz were correlated with the audiometric AAT-induced TTS.CONCLUSION: Acute acoustic trauma-induced audiometric TTS are predominantly confined to 2 specific frequency regions. PTA and EFA are both necessary to identify the full extent of acute acoustic trauma. PTA and EFA revealed that the TTSs were correlated to with distortion product OAE amplitude shifts at 6 kHz and changes in the reproducibility of transiently evoked OAE in the 3- to 5-kHz frequency window. PTA remains the most important measurement to monitor AAT. It may be useful to complement it with EFA, focusing on the 11 to 14 kHz frequency range. If used, OAE should be analyzed in the frequency range of 3 to 6 kHz."
"22918148","Early detection of non-organic hearing loss using a simple tone-in-noise test.","Early detection of non-organic hearing loss (NOHL) is important in order to ensure appropriate management decisions. One possible audiometric test for achieving this is the tone-in-noise (TIN) test although its current format is not widely applicable and may not optimize accuracy. We sought to investigate a modified TIN test, using narrowband noise, and the influence of different noise levels and alternative approaches to determining the outcome. Seventy-five normal-hearing and 8 hearing-impaired subjects were asked to feign or exaggerate a hearing loss. The shift in genuine or exaggerated/feigned thresholds with the introduction of ipsilateral noise was determined. The TIN test was able to accurately separate between genuine and feigned thresholds when using narrowband noise presented at the effective masking level corresponding to the apparent tone threshold and using a 'fail' criterion of a repeatable threshold shift of = 10 dB at one or more frequencies. It also produced similar shifts in exaggerated thresholds. In conclusion, this modified TIN test is a potentially accurate method to rapidly identify unilateral and bilateral NOHL in a wide range on contexts and could be applied to automated audiometry."

The thresholds of higher frequency band, 3 kHz and 4 kHz were compared with the threshold of ABR. The thresholds of auditory frequency ban and 0.5 kHz were compared with the threshold of 40 Hz AERP.RESULTS: A better correlation was found between thresholds of ABR and higher frequency pure tone audiometry. There was a significant difference of thresholds between 40 kHz AERP and pure tone audiometry. The correction values of thresholds between 40 kHz AERP and pure tone audiometry in the light noise-induced hearing impairment group and the moderate noise-induced hearing impairment group were (16.43  1.08) and (11.80  1.12) dBn HL, respectively.CONCLUSION: In diagnosis of occupational noise-induced hearing impairment, the threshold of ABR can be used to estimate the hearing threshold of pure noise higher frequency. Because there is the significant difference of the thresholds between pure tone audiometry and 40 Hz AERP, the response threshold can not be served as the audiometry threshold, and the behavioral hearing thresholds can only be obtained by adjusting the response threshold with respective correction value."

The major industries in India are based on manufacturing. There are appreciable numbers of casting and forging units spread across the country. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of permanent hearing threshold shift among the workers engaged in Indian iron and steel small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and compared with control group subjects. As a part of hearing protection intervention, audiometric tests were conducted at low (250-1000 Hz), medium (1500-3000 Hz), and high (4000-8000 Hz) frequencies. The occurrence of hearing loss was determined based on hearing threshold levels with a low fence of 25 dB. Comparisons were made for hearing threshold at different frequencies between the exposed and control groups using Student's t test. ANOVA was used for the comparison of hearing threshold dB at different frequencies among occupation and year of experience. A P value &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All data were presented as mean value (SD). Over 90% of workers engaged in various processes of casting and forging industry showed hearing loss in the noise-sensitive medium and higher frequencies. Occupation was significantly associated with NIHL, and hearing loss was particularly high among the workers of forging section. The analyses revealed a higher prevalence of significant hearing loss among the forging workers compared to the workers associated with other activities. The study shows alarming signals of NIHL, especially in forging workers. The occupational exposure to noise could be minimized by efficient control measures through engineering controls, administrative controls, and the use of personal protective devices. Applications of engineering and/or administrative controls are frequently not feasible in the developing countries for technical and financial reasons. A complete hearing conservation programme, including training, audiometry, job rotation, and the use of hearing protection devices, is the most feasible method for the protection of industrial workers from prevailing noise in workplace environments in the developing countries."

They were confirmed to have pure-tone air-conduction hearing threshold levels (HTLs). The hREAT and F-MIRE NA values were measured by a Rion AG-20A and a 3M E-A-Rfit, respectively.RESULTS: The NA values could not be measured by hREAT for four workers (hREAT-group). The mean NA of the earplugs for subjects for whom hREAT measurements were possible (hREAT+ group) was 26.0  10.0 dB. The NA of the earplugs could be measured for all subjects using F-MIRE, and the NAs of the hREAT- and hREAT+ groups were 9.5  8.7 and 21.0  7.3 dB. The mean HTL value at 500 Hz to 2 kHz was 45.8  3.1 dB for the hREAT- group, which was significantly lower than the value for the hREAT+ group, 18.0  8.6 dB.CONCLUSION: Because there is a difference between the NA values obtained by hREAT and F-MIRE, it may be necessary to compensate for this difference. In addition, workers with hearing loss and the length of the measurement time need to be taken into consideration. Finally the F-MIRE method may be useful for educating workers about using earplugs in noisy workplaces."

Failure of the screening was defined by missing at least one frequency in one ear. In addition to hearing screening, the students filled out a questionnaire asking for practices related to exposure to loud music.STUDY SAMPLE: 1296 adolescents aged 14 to 15 years.RESULTS: The overall rate of failing the hearing screening was 14.9% (95% CI: 13.0%-16.8%). The rate was similar in adolescents with no, little, or moderate exposure to loud music (10% to 15%), but significantly increased (22% to 25%) in adolescents with high exposure.CONCLUSIONS: The observed failing rate compares well to findings on the prevalence of hearing deficits in adolescents reported in other studies. In addition, our study suggests that the risk for hearing damage from loud music is not steadily increasing with increase of exposure, but exists only under conditions of extreme listening."
"22568995","The effect of noise exposure on the cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential.","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of noise exposure on the cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP) in individuals with asymmetric noise-induced sensorineural hearing loss (NIHL).DESIGN: A cross-sectional observational study was used to compare cVEMP characteristics in 43 individuals with a history of noise exposure greater in one ear (e.g., the left ear of a right-handed rifle shooter) and asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss consistent with the history of noise exposure and in 14 age-matched controls. The characteristics of hearing loss were examined further for the noise-exposed participants with abnormal cVEMPs and the noise-exposed participants with normal cVEMPs.RESULTS: Thirty-three percent of the noise-exposed participants had abnormal cVEMPs, whereas cVEMPs were present and symmetrical in 100% of the age-matched controls, and cVEMP threshold was greater in the noise-exposed group than in the control group. Abnormal cVEMPs occurred most often in the ears with poorer hearing (or greater NIHL), and the noise-exposed participants who had abnormal cVEMPs had poorer high-frequency pure-tone thresholds (greater NIHL) and greater interaural high-frequency pure-tone threshold differences than the noise-exposed participants with normal cVEMPs.CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with previous studies that suggest that the sacculocollic pathway may be susceptible to noise-related damage. There is emerging evidence that the severity of NIHL is associated with the presence or absence of cVEMPs."
"22548779","Noise-induced hearing loss and associated factors among vector control workers in a Malaysian state.","This study aims to determine the prevalence and associated factors of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) among vector control workers in the state of Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. This was an analytical cross-sectional study conducted on 181 vector control workers who were working in district health offices in a state in Malaysia. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire and audiometry. Prevalence of NIHL was 26% among this group of workers. NIHL was significantly associated with the age-group of 40 years and older, length of service of 10 or more years, current occupational noise exposure, listening to loud music, history of firearms use, and history of mumps/measles infection. Following logistic regression, age of more than 40 years and noise exposure in current occupation were associated with NIHL with an odds ratio of 3.45 (95% confidence interval = 1.68-7.07) and 6.87 (95% confidence interval = 1.54-30.69), respectively, among this group of vector control workers."
"22517306","Early occupational hearing loss of workers in a stone crushing industry: our experience in a developing country.","Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is an irreversible sensorineural hearing loss associated with exposure to high levels of excessive noise. This paper aims to assess the prevalence of early NIHL and the awareness of the effects of noise on health among stone crushing industry workers. This was a comparative cross-sectional study in Ghana of 140 workers from the stone crushing industry compared with a control group of 150 health workers. The stone workers and controls were evaluated using a structured questionnaire, which assessed symptoms of hearing loss, tinnitus, knowledge on the health hazards associated with work in noisy environment and the use of hearing protective device. Pure tone audiometric assessment was carried out for stone workers and controls. Noise levels at the work stations of the stone workers and of the controls were measured. Statistical Analysis of data was carried out using SPSS package version 16. The mean age of stone workers and controls was 42.587.85 and 42.1912 years, respectively. Subjective hearing loss occurred in 21.5% of the workers and in 2.8% of the controls. Tinnitus occurred in 26.9% of stone workers and 21.5% of controls, while 87.5% stone workers had sound knowledge on the health hazards of a noisy environment. Early NIHL in the left ear occurred in 19.3% of the stone workers compared with 0.7% in controls and in the right ear, it occurred in 14.3% of the stone workers and in 1.3% of the controls; P&lt;0.005. In conclusion, the prevalence rate of early NIHL among stone crushing workers is about 19.3% for the left ear and 14.3% for the right ear."
"22513929","Interventions to promote the wearing of hearing protection.","BACKGROUND: This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 2, 2006 and previously updated in 2009.Noise-induced hearing loss can be prevented by eliminating or lowering noise exposure levels. Where the source of the noise cannot be eliminated, workers have to rely on hearing protection equipment. Several trials have been conducted to study the effectiveness of interventions to influence the wearing of hearing protection.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to enhance the wearing of hearing protection among persons regularly exposed to high noise levels.SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 1); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 8 April 2011.SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies if they had a randomised design, if they were among noise exposed (&gt; 80 dB(A)) persons, if they included an intervention to promote the wearing of hearing protection (compared to another intervention or no intervention), and if the outcome measured was the amount of use of hearing protection or a proxy measure thereof.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors selected relevant trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.MAIN RESULTS: Seven studies, involving 4670 participants, were included.A computer-based intervention lasting 30 minutes, tailored to the risk of an individual worker, was not found to be more effective than a video providing general information among workers, around 80% of whom already used hearing protection.A four-year school-based hearing loss prevention programme found that the intervention group was twice as likely to wear some kind of hearing protection as the control group that received a baseline hearing test and two additional tests at years two and three.We conducted two meta-analyses for the comparisons 'tailored strategy (the use of communication or other types of interventions that are specific to an individual or a group and aim to change behaviour) versus non-tailored strategy' and 'tailored strategy versus a commercial video on the use of hearing protection' to look at mean percentage use of hearing protective devices (HPDs), that showed improvement in the mean use of HPDs for the tailored group. A meta-analysis of the comparison 'mixed interventions' (classroom instruction, distribution of HPDs, mailings, noise level assessments and audiometric testing) versus control (audiometric testing alone) also showed improvement in self reported use of HPDs when shooting firearms.Tailored education showed an improvement in HPD use of 8.3% versus targeted education (6.1%).AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence found in this review shows that some interventions improve the mean use of hearing protection devices compared to non-intervention. Future trials should have standard outcomes and interventions to allow the combining of results in meta-analysis."
"25991940","A study of the high-frequency hearing thresholds of dentistry professionals.","INTRODUCTION:  In the dentistry practice, dentists are exposed to harmful effects caused by several factors, such as the noise produced by their work instruments. In 1959, the American Dental Association recommended periodical hearing assessments and the use of ear protectors. Aquiring more information regarding dentists', dental nurses', and prosthodontists' hearing abilities is necessary to propose prevention measures and early treatment strategies.OBJECTIVE:  To investigate the auditory thresholds of dentists, dental nurses, and prosthodontists.METHOD:  In this clinical and experimental study, 44 dentists (Group I; GI), 36 dental nurses (Group II; GII), and 28 prosthodontists (Group III; GIII) were included, , with a total of 108 professionals. The procedures that were performed included a specific interview, ear canal inspection, conventional and high-frequency threshold audiometry, a speech reception threshold test, and an acoustic impedance test.RESULTS:  In the 3 groups that were tested, the comparison between the mean hearing thresholds provided evidence of worsened hearing ability relative to the increase in frequency. For the tritonal mean at 500 to 2,000<U+2009>Hz and 3,000 to 6,000<U+2009>Hz, GIII presented the worst thresholds. For the mean of the high frequencies (9,000 and 16,000 Hz), GII presented the worst thresholds.CONCLUSION:  The conventional hearing threshold evaluation did not demonstrate alterations in the 3 groups that were tested; however, the complementary tests such as high-frequency audiometry provided greater efficacy in the early detection of hearing problems, since this population's hearing loss impaired hearing ability at frequencies that are not tested by the conventional tests. Therefore, we emphasize the need of utilizing high-frequency threshold audiometry in the hearing assessment routine in combination with other audiological tests."
"22452494","Effect of kennel noise on hearing in dogs.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the degree of noise to which kenneled dogs were exposed in 2 typical kennels and to determine whether a measurable change in hearing might have developed as a result of exposure to this noise.ANIMALS: 14 dogs temporarily housed in 2 kennel environments.PROCEDURES: Noise levels were measured for a 6-month period in one environment (veterinary technical college kennel) and for 3 months in another (animal shelter). Auditory brainstem response testing was performed on dogs in the veterinary kennel 48 hours and 3 and 6 months after arrival. Temporal changes in the lowest detectable response levels for wave V were analyzed.RESULTS: Acoustic analysis of the kennel environments revealed equivalent sound level values ranging between 100 and 108 dB sound pressure level for the 2 kennels. At the end of 6 months, all 14 dogs that underwent hearing tests had a measured change in hearing.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results of the noise assessments indicated levels that are damaging to the human auditory system. Such levels could be considered dangerous for kenneled dogs as well, particularly given the demonstrated hearing loss in dogs housed in the veterinary kennel for a prolonged period. Noise abatement strategies should be a standard part of kennel design and operation when such kennels are intended for long-term housing of dogs."
"22436020","Overall versus individual changes for otoacoustic emissions and audiometry in a noise-exposed cohort.","OBJECTIVE: For a noise-exposed group of workers, group-averaged and individual changes were compared for pure-tone audiometry, transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs), and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) in order to see if they exhibit the same pattern in time.DESIGN: Baseline and 17-months follow-up hearing status was examined with pure-tone audiometry, TEOAEs, and DPOAEs.STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 233 noise-exposed employees were measured, while 60 subjects from this group contributed to test-retest reliability measures.RESULTS: Group-averaged changes and individual shifts followed similar patterns: decreases for audiometry at 6-8 kHz and DPOAE at 1.5 kHz, and enhancements for DPOAE at 3 kHz. TEOAEs showed an overall deterioration while both individual deteriorations and enhancements were larger than chance. DPOAE at 6 kHz showed the largest group-averaged change, while the number of individual shifts was not significant. There were no clear relations between changes in audiometry and changes in OAE.CONCLUSION: Significant individual OAE changes do not necessarily follow the same pattern as the group-averaged results. This limits the applicability of OAE testing for the monitoring of individual subjects. Furthermore, hearing deterioration might manifest itself in a local enhancement of otoacoustic emissions and not only in the form of decreases in amplitude."
"22407044","Audiometric evaluation of patients treated for pulmonary tuberculosis.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hearing status of patients being treated for pulmonary tuberculosis at referral hospitals in Brazil.METHODS: This was a descriptive study involving 97 male and female inpatients/outpatients between 18 and 60 years of age who were undergoing treatment for active pulmonary tuberculosis at one of two referral hospitals in the state of Rio de Janeiro. After being interviewed, all of the patients underwent pure tone audiometry.RESULTS: Of the 97 patients studied, 65 (67%) were male, 52 (54%) were receiving first-line treatment, and 45 (46%) were receiving second-line treatment, which included aminoglycosides. Smoking, alcohol consumption, exposure to noise, and ototoxic medication use were identified in 65 (67%), 51 (53%), 53 (55%), and 45 (46.4%) of the patients, respectively. The most common auditory and vestibular complaints were dizziness, in 28 patients (28.8%); tinnitus, in 27 (27.8%); and hypoacusis, in 23 (23.7%).CONCLUSIONS: Due to the great number of patients with hearing loss in the present study, we recommend that all patients under tuberculosis treatment be submitted to auditory monitoring."
"22397215","Audiometric characteristics in patients with noise-induced hearing loss after sodium enoxaparin treatment.","OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of sodium enoxaparin treatment on patients with noise-induced hearing loss.METHODS: Sixty patients with noise-induced hearing loss were included and randomly divided into two numerically equal groups. Group A underwent therapy with sodium enoxaparin for 10 days, followed by an additional 10 days of treatment after 10 days of no treatment. Group B received placebo as a control. Before treatment, at the end of treatment, and 2 months after the end of treatment, all patients underwent evaluation by laboratory tests, pure tone audiometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) testing, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) testing, and auditory brain stem response testing.RESULTS: In contrast to group B, at the end of the treatment in group A pure tone audiometry showed a significant (p &lt; 0.05) improvement of the audiometric thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 kHz. Depending on the air and bone conduction thresholds, TEOAEs and DPOAEs, which had previously been absent, were evoked at the frequencies examined. These improvements were confirmed at last follow-up. We found no significant differences in auditory brain stem responses or laboratory results.CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data encourage further studies to collect additional evidence on the effect of sodium enoxaparin in preventing the development of noise-induced hearing loss."
"22389092","Noise-induced hearing threshold shift among US adults and implications for noise-induced hearing loss: National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys.","The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence and evaluate the associated risk factors of the noise-induced hearing threshold shift (NITS) in the US adult population based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). The study population consisted of 5,418 individuals aged 20-69 years who had complete audiologic data from the NHANES database. Stringent criteria were used to define NITS. Prevalence of unilateral, bilateral, and total NITS and their association with several socio-demographic and hearing-related factors were evaluated. The prevalence of unilateral, bilateral, and total NITS was 9.4, 3.4 and 12.8%, respectively. Prevalence of bilateral NITS was higher in subjects with older age, male gender, white (non-Hispanic) and Hispanic ethnicities, education level less than or equal to high school diploma, married/living with partner status, Mexico as country of birth, service in armed forces, smoking history, diabetes, and different kinds of noise exposure. Odds of NITS were only higher in older people, males, and smokers. This study provides comprehensive information on the prevalence of NITS in the US adult population and its associated risk factors. More targeted interventions may be done for educational, preventative, and screening purposes."
"22387711","Validation of a questionnaire to identify hearing loss among farm operators.","Workers in certain industries (e.g., agriculture) do not participate in a hearing conservation program and rarely receive this important preventive care. The National Institute for Deafness and Communication Disorders (NIDCD) has published a questionnaire to assess a person's need for medical examination of their hearing. The use of a self-administered questionnaire may pose a simple, low cost opportunity to assess the hearing health of workers not included in a hearing conservation program. However, the validity of the NIDCD questionnaire has not been tested. A study was conducted to compare the results of audiometric screening and the NIDCD questionnaire in identifying persons at risk for hearing impairment who may benefit from a medical referral. Data were collected from 103 farm operators at a regional farm show. Receiver-operator characteristic curves, measuring the ability of the questionnaire to correctly classify those with and without the disease suggested that the level of performance of the questionnaire as a whole, ranged from 0.74 to 0.69 (fair to poor). However, selected questionnaire items (e.g., Do you have to strain to understand conversations?) had moderate agreement (0.38 to 0.41) with screening audiogram results. Overall, the 10-item instrument did not perform as well as instruments with fewer items reported in separate studies. These findings suggest that, while less desirable than audiometry, alternative self-administered instruments might perform the better in this group. This approach may be useful as an alternative screening method to detect risk of hearing loss and identifying the need for medical evaluation of hearing sensitivity, particularly among farm operators."
"22387709","Tracking occupational hearing loss across global industries: a comparative analysis of metrics.","Occupational hearing loss is one of the most prevalent occupational conditions; yet, there is no acknowledged international metric to allow comparisons of risk between different industries and regions. In order to make recommendations for an international standard of occupational hearing loss, members of an international industry group (the International Aluminium Association) submitted details of different hearing loss metrics currently in use by members. We compared the performance of these metrics using an audiometric data set for over 6000 individuals working in 10 locations of one member company. We calculated rates for each metric at each location from 2002 to 2006. For comparison, we calculated the difference of observed-expected (for age) binaural high-frequency hearing loss (in dB/year) for each location over the same time period. We performed linear regression to determine the correlation between each metric and the observed-expected rate of hearing loss. The different metrics produced discrepant results, with annual rates ranging from 0.0% for a less-sensitive metric to more than 10% for a highly sensitive metric. At least two metrics, a 10dB age-corrected threshold shift from baseline and a 15dB nonage-corrected shift metric, correlated well with the difference of observed-expected high-frequency hearing loss. This study suggests that it is feasible to develop an international standard for tracking occupational hearing loss in industrial working populations."
"22387708","Validity of hearing impairment calculation methods for prediction of self-reported hearing handicap.","Worker's compensation for hearing loss caused by occupational noise exposure is calculated by varying methods, from state to state within the United States (US), with many employing arithmetic formulas based on the pure-tone audiogram, to quantify hearing loss. Several assumptions unsupported or weakly supported by empirical data underlie these formulas. The present study evaluated the ability of various arithmetic hearing impairment calculations to predict a self-reported hearing handicap in a sample of presenting with sensorineural hearing loss. 204 adults (127 male, 77 female) ranging in age from 18 to 94 served as participants. The sample was selected to exclude patients who had been referred for hearing testing for a medicolegal examination or a hearing conservation appointment. A hearing handicap was measured by the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults/for the Elderly (HHIA/E). The covariance analysis of linear structural equations was used to assess the relative strength of correlation with the HHIA/E score among the six formulas and various forms of pure-tone average. The results revealed that all the hearing impairment calculations examined were significantly, but weakly, correlated with the self-reported hearing impairment scores. No significant differences among the predictive abilities of the impairment calculations were evident; however, the average binaural impairment assigned differed significantly among the six calculations examined. Individuals who demonstrated 0% impairment had significantly lower (i.e., better) HHIA/E scores compared to those with non-zero impairment for each formula. These results supported the idea that audiometric data provided an insufficient explanation for real-world hearing difficulties."
"22387707","Audiological and electrophysiological assessment of professional pop/rock musicians.","In the present study, we evaluated peripheral and central auditory pathways in professional musicians (with and without hearing loss) compared to non-musicians. The goal was to verify if music exposure could affect auditory pathways as a whole. This is a prospective study that compared the results obtained between three groups (musicians with and without hearing loss and non-musicians). Thirty-two male individuals participated and they were assessed by: Immittance measurements, pure-tone air conduction thresholds at all frequencies from 0.25 to 20 kHz, Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions, Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR), and Cognitive Potential. The musicians showed worse hearing thresholds in both conventional and high frequency audiometry when compared to the non-musicians; the mean amplitude of Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions was smaller in the musicians group, but the mean latencies of Auditory Brainstem Response and Cognitive Potential were diminished in the musicians when compared to the non-musicians. Our findings suggest that the population of musicians is at risk for developing music-induced hearing loss. However, the electrophysiological evaluation showed that latency waves of ABR and P300 were diminished in musicians, which may suggest that the auditory training to which these musicians are exposed acts as a facilitator of the acoustic signal transmission to the cortex."

The purposes of this study were to determine the intensity and frequency components of dental instruments used by dental staff nurses and the prevalence of noise induced hearing loss.METHODOLOGY: We performed a comparative, cross sectional study on a group of dental staff nurses. Participants underwent ear examination followed by pure tone audiometry. Pure tone audiometry was performed at least 48 hours after the participants were free from noise exposure. Noise induced hearing loss was defined as failed definitive threshold at a frequency of 4000 Hz greater than 20 dB. The intensity level, noise spectrum, and frequency of hand piece, saliva suction, and scaler were recorded during the dental procedure.RESULTS: A total of 65 dental staff nurses were included. The mean intensity of hand pieces, scalers, and saliva suctions were 88.7 (SD2.2), 87.1 (SD2.6), and 77.4 (SD6.3) dBA while their most prominent frequencies were 3880, 7997, and 3513 Hz, respectively. Three of the subjects had slightly more than 20 dB hearing loss at 4 kHz on audiogram; all were affected unilaterally. These three individuals worked as dental nurses for 11, 13, and 21 years, respectively. Therefore, the prevalence of noise induced hearing loss was 5.0% (95% CI: -1.0%, 10.0%).CONCLUSIONS: Dental staff nurses might have an increased risk of noise induced hearing loss, depending upon individual factors influencing susceptibility and duration of noise exposure."
"22330978","Hearing loss, hyperacusis, or tinnitus: what is modeled in animal research?","Animal models of tinnitus require a behavioral correlate thereof. Various conditioned response methods and gap-startle reflex methods are in use and the outcomes generally correspond with putative electrophysiological substrates of tinnitus. However, for salicylate-induced tinnitus there is discordance between the behavioral and electrophysiological test results. As a result, it is not clear what the various tests are reflecting. A review of the, mostly sub-cortical, neural circuits that underlie the behavioral responses suggests that cortical electrophysiological correlates do not necessarily have to correspond with behavioral ones. Human objective correlates of tinnitus point heavily into cortical network, but not just auditory cortex, correlates of tinnitus. Furthermore, the synaptic mechanisms underlying spontaneous firing rate changes may be different from those involved in driven neural activity."
"22326290","Relative risk of elevated hearing threshold compared to ISO1999 normative populations for Royal Australian Air Force male personnel.","OBJECTIVE: This paper introduces a new method to calculate relative risks of elevated hearing thresholds, at various ages and frequencies, between a study population and ISO1999:2003: Annex A Screened, Annex B Unscreened and ISO1999 Section 5.3 adjustment for noise exposure using Annex A Screened data. We demonstrate this method on a study population of male Royal Australian Air Force personnel.STUDY DESIGN: Using a retrospective cohort design, hearing thresholds were assessed in 583 F-111 aircraft maintenance personnel, 377 technical-trade comparisons and 492 non-technical comparisons using pure-tone audiometry. A quantile regression model was used determine whether an association exists between median hearing thresholds and F-111 maintenance, adjusting for possible confounders. The new method involves using quantile regression models with bootstrapped standard errors to estimate percentiles for the study population and thus determine the probability of a greater than 25 dB hearing threshold. This was done for the three ISO datasets as follows; for the ISO1999 Annex A screened population data the formula provided allows the calculation of these probabilities. ISO1999 Annex B unscreened population data only provides the values for the 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles at ages 30, 40, 50 and 60 only, therefore it was necessary to fit a curve to these values in order to estimate the probabilities. For ISO1999 Section 5.3 adjustment for noise exposure population we used the Annex A screened population data plus the formula. The probabilities were then divided to give the relative risks of a greater than 25 dB hearing threshold, at various ages and frequencies.RESULTS: While no difference was observed between the three groups, the model identified a number of significant confounders, namely tinnitus, smoking, diabetes and the use of anti-depressant medications. Relative risks were high at frequencies 2 kHz and less for the study population of all ages compared to ISO A screened data. The increased relative risks at 4 and 6 kHz give the appearance of a &quot;noise notch&quot; for ages 30 and 40 years. The comparison with the ISO B unscreened data are significantly less than one for frequencies above 2 kHz, particularly for young men and greater than one less than 2 kHz. The relative risks for the comparison to the ISO A screened data with ISO 5.3 adjustments, are highest for young men decreasing with age, with the highest relative risk are at frequencies less than 2 kHz.CONCLUSIONS: This paper demonstrates a new method for quantifying the probability of a clinically relevant hearing loss and the relative risk of the loss due to a risk factor. Prior to this, researchers were reduced to simplistic methods such as visual comparison of deciles which did not enable the estimation of risk. The new method can use all observed hearing thresholds per study participant, adjust for known confounding factors such age and gender, and calculate the relative risk of a clinically relevant increase in hearing threshold due to a risk factor of interest."
"22284753","Hearing effects from intermittent and continuous noise exposure in a study of Korean factory workers and firefighters.","BACKGROUND: South Korea and surrounding countries in East Asia are believed to have the highest proportion in the world of high frequency hearing loss due to occupational noise exposure, yet there has been limited information published in international journals, and limited information for control of noise in local workplaces beyond strategies from western countries. We exploit medical surveillance information from two worker groups to enhance local knowledge about noise-induced hearing loss and explore the possible importance of shift work to risk.METHODS: Four-years of hearing data were evaluated for 81 male farm machine factory workers and 371 male firefighters who had successfully completed a health examination and questionnaires for the duration of the study period. The averages of hearing thresholds at 2, 3, and 4 kHz were used as the primary end-point for comparison. Repeat measure analysis adjusted for age, exposure duration and smoking status was used to measure the difference in hearing threshold between the two groups.RESULTS: Noise levels were measured in the factory at a mean of 82 dBA, with a range of 66-97. No concurrent measurements were taken for the firefighters, but historic comparison values showed a wider range but a similar mean of 76-79 dBA. Although losses during follow-up were negligible, the factory workers had significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) more hearing loss at the baseline of the study than the firefighters in both ears at 2, 3, and 4 kHz, adjusted for age, duration of employment and smoking status. Among those with 10 years of employment, mean losses at these frequencies among the factory workers fell into the impairment range (&gt; 25 dB loss). Firefighters also showed increased losses associated with longer exposure duration, but these were significantly less marked. Losses at lower frequencies (&lt; or = 1 kHz) were negligible in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: Korean work environments with continuous noise exposure in the measured range should consider implementation of a hearing conservation program. Further evaluation of hearing loss in workers exposed to irregular or intermittent high noise levels, such as firefighters, is also warranted."
"22234848","[Gttingen sentence in noise for different audiogram classes].","BACKGROUND: In addition to the standardized Freiburg sentence test in silence validated speech tests in noise are available. They are mainly used to test the benefit of hearing systems in everyday-life situations. In diagnostics tests in noise can also give additional information of the patients' hearing impairment. The determined speech reception threshold (SRT) depends on the degree of hearing loss and the used speech and noise test material. Aim of this study was to analyze the results of the Gttingen sentence test in noise in relation to different audiogram classes.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Gttingen sentence test in stationary noise (65 dB) was performed for 135 patients with different degrees of hearing losses. Based on the air-conducted threshold all ears were categorized to an audiogram class by an automated procedure.RESULTS: For the mild hearing losses the results of the Gttingen sentence test increased with increasing pure-tone-average (PTA) and the values are smaller than 0 dB SNR with a small standard deviation ( 1-2 dB SNR). For the moderate hearing losses values of 5 dB SNR with a standard deviation of 6 dB SNR were achieved on average. Patients with a high hearing loss achieved values higher than 20 dB SNR.CONCLUSION: For the mild hearing losses the results were located in a small range. However, they can give important information about the patient's hearing impairment mainly appears in a noisy environment. With increasing hearing loss also the reduced hearing in silence affects the results achieved with the Gttingen sentence test in noise. Therefore the hearing in silence has to be taken into account at the interpretation of the results."

However, literature regarding adolescents' listening behavior and how their attitudes and beliefs relate to behavior is currently limited.PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were (1) to investigate the relationship between volume control settings and output levels of PLDs, (2) to examine how adolescents' listening behavior changes as a function of background noise and noise isolation, (3) to investigate the relationship between self-reported listening levels and laboratory-measured listening levels, and (4) to evaluate the validity of the Listening Habits Questionnaire as a research tool for evaluating how attitudes and beliefs relate to PLD use behavior.RESEARCH DESIGN: A descriptive study. Experiment 1 evaluated the output levels of a set of PLDs, and Experiment 2 characterized the listening behavior and attitudes toward PLD use of a group of adolescents.STUDY SAMPLE: Twenty-nine adolescents aged 13-17 yr, with normal hearing, participated in Experiment 2.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Experiment 1 evaluated the output levels of a set of PLDs with stock and accessory earphones using an acoustic manikin. Experiment 2 included survey measures of listening behavior and attitudes as well as output levels measured using a probe microphone.CONCLUSIONS: The output levels of PLDs are capable of reaching levels that could increase the risk for MIHL, and 14% of teenagers in this study reported behavior that puts them at increased risk for hearing loss. However, measured listening levels in the laboratory settings did not correlate well with self-reported typical listening levels. Further, the Listening Habits Questionnaire described in this study may provide a useful research tool for examining the relationship between attitudes and beliefs and listening behavior."

The noise levels and the organic solvent concentrations in the working environment were measured on a common type of gun boat. The findings revealed that 39.6% of naval officers had hearing loss. The noise level (LAeq) was 100.6 dB in the engine room. The organic solvent concentrations were less than the occupational exposure limit for organic solvents. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated 2 factors were significantly associated with hearing loss. They were age and service experience. The results suggest that the Thai navy should develop a hearing conservation program for naval officers on coastal patrol crafts."
"24237040","Exploring the sensitivity of speech-in-noise tests for noise-induced hearing loss.","OBJECTIVE: Recently, the digit triplet test was shown to be a sensitive speech-in-noise test for early high-frequency hearing loss in noise-exposed workers. This study investigates if a further improvement is achieved when using a closed set of consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) speech items with the same vowel, and/or a low-pass (LP) filtered version of the standard speech-shaped noise.DESIGN: Speech reception thresholds in noise were gathered for the digit triplet, CVC, and CVC_LP test and compared to the high-frequency pure-tone average (PTA).STUDY SAMPLE: 118 noise-exposed workers showing a wide range of high-frequency hearing losses.RESULTS: For the 84 Dutch-speaking participants, the CVC test showed an increased measurement error and a decreased between-subject variation, leading to a weaker correlation with the PTA2,3,4,6 (R = 0.64) and thus a lower sensitivity compared to the digit triplet test (R = 0.86). However, the use of LP-filtered noise resulted in a sensitivity improvement (R = 0.79 versus R = 0.64) due to the large increase in between-subject spread. Similar trends were found for the 34 French-speaking workers.CONCLUSIONS: Using CVC words with the same vowel could not increase the sensitivity to detect isolated high-frequency hearing loss. With LP-filtered noise, test sensitivity improved, but it did not surpass the original digit triplet test."
"24231420","The prevalence of audiometric notches in adolescents in Germany: The Ohrkan-study.","Although there is concern about increasing hearing loss in adolescents caused by leisure noise exposure, prevalence data are scarce. In an US study, about 16-17% of adolescents were affected by audiometric notches. To estimate the prevalence of audiometric notches in adolescents in Germany, baseline data of the cohort study Ohrkan, recruitment during the school years 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 were analyzed. All students in grade 9 visiting any school in the city of Regensburg were eligible for participation. Data was collected via standardized questionnaires from students and their parents. In addition, students were asked to visit the University Clinics of Regensburg for ear examination including a tympanogram and the determination of hearing thresholds in air conduction audiometry. The prevalence of audiometric notches was determined in students with normal tympanogram in both ears and complete audiometry data. Audiometric notches were defined according to criteria used to analyse US data. Overall, 2149 students (1158 girls, 991 boys mainly aged 15-16 years) of the 3846 eligible adolescents (56%) participated. Among the 1843 adolescents with complete audiometry and tympanometry data, the prevalence of audiometric notches was 2.4% (95% confidence interval 1.7-3.1%). We could not confirm the high prevalence of audiometric notches as reported in National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys for adolescents in the US. Differences in prevalence might be at least partly due to methodical differences in audiometry. Even if empirical evidence is presently ambiguous, it is reasonable to educate young people about the potential risks of high leisure noise exposure. "
"24220478","Occupational safety threats among dental personnel and related risk factors.","Occupational diseases are primarily considered to be important health problems for individuals with occupations in heavy industry fields. Although dentists work in very clean and elegant offices, they are frequently exposed to various chemicals and high-intensity, sound-producing instruments, such as compressors and aerators. In our study, we aimed to investigate the risk for occupational hearing loss of dental personnel, by performing pure-tone audiometry in 40 dentists and comparing the results with those of healthy individuals. We also sampled the nasal mucosa to investigate the effects of occupational chemicals on the nasal mucosa of the dentists. The pure-tone audiometric thresholds at 5 different frequencies (1000, 2000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz) and working time were evaluated as potential risk factors. The pure-tone audiometric results (as decibels) at each frequency and the median values for each side (right and left ears) were significantly higher for dentists than for the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The pure-tone audiometric results did not significantly differ between the women and men in the study group (P &gt; 0.05). The findings in the nasal mucosa (goblet cell hyperplasia, neutrophil/eosinophil/basophil distribution, metaplasia, dysplasia, premalignant or malignant cells) were similar in the study and control groups (P &gt; 0.05). In conclusion, our study indicated that high-intensity, sound-producing equipment is an important occupational threat for dentists, whereas chemical agents have minimal hazardous effects. "
"24212050","Left hemisphere fractional anisotropy increase in noise-induced tinnitus: a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study of white matter tracts in the brain.","Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a contemporary neuroimaging modality used to study connectivity patterns and microstructure of white matter tracts in the brain. The use of DTI in the study of tinnitus is a relatively unexplored methodology with no studies focusing specifically on tinnitus induced by noise exposure. In this investigation, participants were two groups of adults matched for etiology, age, and degree of peripheral hearing loss, but differed by the presence or absence (+/-) of tinnitus. It is assumed that matching individuals on the basis of peripheral hearing loss, allows for differentiating changes in white matter microstructure due to hearing loss from changes due to the effects of chronic tinnitus. Alterations in white matter tracts, using the fractional anisotropy (FA) metric, which measures directional diffusion of water, were quantified using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) with additional details provided by invivo probabilistic tractography. Our results indicate that 10 voxel clusters differentiated the two groups, including 9 with higher FA in the group with tinnitus. A decrease in FA was found for a single cluster in the group with tinnitus. However, seven of the 9 clusters with higher FA were in left hemisphere thalamic, frontal, and parietal white matter. These foci were localized to the anterior thalamic radiations and the inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi. The two right-sided clusters with increased FA were located in the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and superior longitudinal fasciculus. The only decrease in FA for the tinnitus-positive group was found in the superior longitudinal fasciculus of the left parietal lobe. "

The results were compared with audiograms from an internal control group of railway workers and an external reference group of people not occupationally exposed to noise. The monaural hearing threshold level at 4kHz, the mean binaural value at 3, 4 and 6kHz and the prevalence of audiometric notches (=25 dB at 4kHz) were used for comparison.RESULTS: Audiograms were available for 1567 drivers, 1565 conductors, 4029 railway worker controls and 15 012 people not occupationally exposed to noise. No difference in hearing level or prevalence of audiometric notches was found between study groups after adjusting for age and gender.CONCLUSIONS: Norwegian train drivers and conductors have normal hearing threshold levels comparable with those in non-exposed groups."
"24131608","Extended high-frequency thresholds in college students: effects of music player use and other recreational noise.","BACKGROUND: Human hearing is sensitive to sounds from as low as 20 Hz to as high as 20,000 Hz in normal ears. However, clinical tests of human hearing rarely include extended high-frequency (EHF) threshold assessments, at frequencies extending beyond 8000 Hz. EHF thresholds have been suggested for use monitoring the earliest effects of noise on the inner ear, although the clinical usefulness of EHF threshold testing is not well established for this purpose.PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study was to determine if EHF thresholds in healthy, young adult college students vary as a function of recreational noise exposure.RESEARCH DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of a laboratory database was conducted; all participants with both EHF threshold testing and noise history data were included. The potential for &quot;preclinical&quot; EHF deficits was assessed based on the measured thresholds, with the noise surveys used to estimate recreational noise exposure.STUDY SAMPLE: EHF thresholds measured during participation in other ongoing studies were available from 87 participants (34 male and 53 female); all participants had hearing within normal clinical limits (=25 HL) at conventional frequencies (0.25-8 kHz).RESULTS: EHF thresholds closely matched standard reference thresholds [ANSI S3.6 (1996) Annex C]. There were statistically reliable threshold differences in participants who used music players, with 3-6 dB worse thresholds at the highest test frequencies (10-16 kHz) in participants who reported long-term use of music player devices (&gt;5 yr), or higher listening levels during music player use.CONCLUSIONS: It should be possible to detect small changes in high-frequency hearing for patients or participants who undergo repeated testing at periodic intervals. However, the increased population-level variability in thresholds at the highest frequencies will make it difficult to identify the presence of small but potentially important deficits in otherwise normal-hearing individuals who do not have previously established baseline data."
"24116664","The audiological health of horn players.","Among orchestral musicians, horn players are one of the most at-risk groups for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). To investigate this group further, pure tone audiometry and a 14-item questionnaire were used to assess the hearing health, as well as attitudes and practices regarding hearing conservation, among 142 French horn players attending an international horn conference in Brisbane, Australia. Of this study's French horn players, 11.1% to 22.2%, and 17.7% to 32.9% of those aged =40 years, showed some form of hearing loss (corrected for age and gender) typical of NIHL, using conservative versus lenient criteria, respectively. Stepwise multiple regression analyses showed no obvious predictor of hearing loss in this study's participants. Of the 18% of participants who reported using hearing protection, 81% used this protection &quot;sometimes&quot; and 50% used generic, foam, or other inferior forms of protection. Continued efforts to better manage the hearing health of horn players is warranted particularly as any hearing loss will affect a horn player's ability to perform and therefore his or her livelihood. Managing the hearing health of horn players will be challenging, however, with no simple predictor of NIHL loss being identified in this study's sample."
"24114066","A longitudinal study of changes in distortion-product otoacoustic emissions and pure-tone thresholds in an industrial setting.","In a longitudinal study of 76 noise-exposed industrial workers, 34 (68 ears) of them were available for final evaluation after 9 years of observation. Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DP) at 65/55 dB SPL and pure-tone audiometry were used to detect noise-induced inner ear changes. Repeated measures analyses of variance were made on the subjects and in a control group, whereas significant threshold shifts (STS) and significant emission shifts (SES) were calculated. Both hearing thresholds and DP showed a high-frequency deterioration, but there was absence of statistical correlation between elevation of hearing thresholds and decrease of DP. There was no clear pattern between individual changes in audiometric thresholds and DP, and all combinations were present: ears with only STS, ears with only SES, ears with both STS and SES and ears with absence of STS and SES. Audiometric changes were maximal at 4 and 6 kHz and DP changes at 2 and 3 kHz. Since significant individual emission changes do not necessarily follow the same pattern as the group-averaged results, the use of DP for monitoring of individual subjects is not advised. However, its use in conjunction with audiometry in hearing conservation programs is highly recommended."
"24110100","A new mechanical index for gauging the human bioeffects of low frequency ultrasound.","Low frequency ultrasound has a diverse set of industrial and medical applications ranging from high power industrial ultrasound equipment through to various therapeutic medical applications. In recent years, several speech interface applications have also been developed which exploit the low ultrasonic frequency region to augment human-computer interfacing. These devices tend to operate just above the threshold of human hearing where signals can be generated and detected using off-the-shelf audio hardware components. Mechanical index has long been one of the main criteria used for determining safety limits for human exposure to ultrasound, however it is known to be inaccurate below about 500 kHz. This paper revisits the mathematical and physical foundations of the mechanical index, in particular transient cavitation, and applies these to the low-frequency ultrasound region. Simulations are performed to evaluate the effects on both blood and water. From the results, a new mechanical index formulation is proposed, which extends down to significantly lower frequencies. The aim is to provide a gauge for determining bio-effects of emerging and future low frequency ultrasonic applications operating around 20 kHz to 100 kHz. "
"24096863","Noise levels among spectators at an intercollegiate sporting event.","PURPOSE: The intensity of noise levels in a basketball arena during games, as well as the hearing sensitivity of attendees, was measured for the purpose of assessing the impact of the noise on hearing thresholds.METHOD: Noise levels at 10 intercollegiate basketball games were measured with a dosimeter affixed on the shoulders of attendees. Hearing thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emissions were measured for 20 participants just before attending a basketball game and within an hour of the end of the game to determine whether changes in hearing thresholds resulted from exposure to the sound levels within the arena during the games.RESULTS: Participants demonstrated temporary shifts in pure-tone thresholds and reductions in the intensity of their otoacoustic emissions after attendance at 1 of the basketball games. Dosimeter measurements showed that noise at 6 of the 10 basketball games exceeded acceptable intensity levels when compared with a national workplace noise exposure standard.CONCLUSION: Although noise intensities, on average, did not exceed workplace exposure standards, universities would be wise to be proactive in warning spectators about the potential dangers of noise exposure at sporting events, make earplugs available to interested spectators, and implement a hearing conservation program for employees working in noise."
"24044059","Noise-induced hearing loss among quarry workers in a north-eastern state of malaysia: a study on knowledge, attitude and practice.","OBJECTIVES: Noise is known to be one of the environmental and occupational hazards listed in the Factory and Machinery Act 1967. Quarries with loud deafening sounds from trucks and machineries pose the risk of noise-induced hearing loss to workers. This study was designed to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice towards noise-induced hearing loss and to determine the prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss and its associated factors among quarry workers in a north-eastern state of Malaysia.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at six quarries in a north-eastern state of Malaysia, with 97 consented respondents who answered a validated version of a questionnaire and underwent pure tone audiogram. The respondents were male, aged between 18 to 50 years, working in the quarry area for at least 6-months duration with no family history of ear diseases.RESULTS: The mean percentage scores of knowledge, attitude and practice were 44 (11), 70 (10) and 28 (16) percent, respectively. The prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss was found to be 57 (95% CI: 47, 67) with 46 (84%) having mild and moderate noise-induced hearing loss, and 34 (62%) involved both ears. Multiple logistic regressions showed that age and practice score were the associated factors with odd ratios of 1.1 (95% CI: 1.1, 1.2; p&lt;0.001) and 0.9 (95% CI: 0.8, 1.0; p=0.008), respectively.CONCLUSION: The knowledge, attitude and practice scores of the respondents were poor and the high prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss was contributed by factors such as poor practice and old age."
"24005271","[The hearing function and vegetative reactions in airport technicians using individual hearing protectors].","The objective of the present study was to evaluate the hearing function in the airport technical personnel and estimate the effectiveness of multicomponent anti-noise hearing protectors used by the specialists engaged in the aircraft maintenance. The tonal threshold audiometry was carried out before and after a shiftwork. The extra-aural effect of noise was assessed from the characteristics of cardiac rhythm variability. The study included two groups of subjects: in one of them (n=8) they used ordinary flight headsets (control) in the other the protection was ensured with the help of multi-insert hearing protectors (n=16). The initial hearing thresholds were found to be increased up to 70 and 60 dB at the frequencies of 4 and 8 kHz respectively. The regression analysis revealed the relationship between these parameters and the duration of aerodrome work experience. Temporary threshold shifts were observed only in the control group. An increase in the tone of the sympathetic nervous system was observed in the control subjects but was absent in the study group. It is concluded that the multi-component hearing protectors employed in the present study are highly efficacious anti-noise devices. The mechanisms of noise-induced hearing loss are discussed. "

The relationship between the development of the main nosological forms of somatic pathology as possible markers of internal ear diseases and professional sensorineural impairment of hearing was elucidated among the members of locomotive crews (n=224). The parameters of interest were evaluated 4 years before, within 1 year, and 4 years after the establishment of diagnosis of OSNIH. It was shown that the members of locomotive crews most frequently suffer atherosclerosis (20.0%), gastrointestinal disorders (34.8%), arterial hypertension (25.0%), osteochondrosis (largely vertebrogenic lumbodynia (21.3%)), and microcirculatory disturbances in the form of vascular spasm in the fundus of the eye (32.9%). 97.6% of the subjects above 35 years of age presented with hypercholesterolemia. Comparative analysis of the occurrence of these nosological forms among the members of locomotive crews with hearing problems on the one hand and the normally functioning organ of hearing on the other hand has demonstrated that none of these pathologies can be regarded as a marker for early diagnosis of OSNIH. At the same time, overweight even in the subjects under 35 years of age should be taken into account when planning and implementing preventive measures. "
"23976950","Noise exposure and hearing impairment among Chinese restaurant workers and entertainment employees in Hong Kong.","BACKGROUND: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a major concern in the non-manufacturing industries. This study aimed to investigate the occupational noise exposure and the NIHL among Chinese restaurant workers and entertainment employees working in the service industry in Hong Kong.METHODS: This cross-sectional survey involved a total of 1,670 participants. Among them, 937 were randomly selected from the workers of Chinese restaurants and 733 were selected from workers in three entertainment sectors: radio and television stations; cultural performance halls or auditoria of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD); and karaoke bars. Noise exposure levels were measured in the sampled restaurants and entertainment sectors. Each participant received an audiometric screening test. Those who were found to have abnormalities were required to take another diagnostic test in the health center. The &quot;Klockhoff digit&quot; method was used to classify NIHL in the present study.RESULTS: The main source of noise inside restaurants was the stoves. The mean hearing thresholds showed a typical dip at 3 to 6 KHz and a substantial proportion (23.7%) of the workers fulfilled the criteria for presumptive NIHL. For entertainment sectors, employees in radio and television stations generally had higher exposure levels than those in the halls or auditoria of the LCSD and karaoke bars. The mean hearing thresholds showed a typical dip at 6 KHz and a substantial proportion of the employees fulfilled the criteria for presumptive NIHL (38.6%, 95%CI: 35.1-42.1%). Being male, older, and having longer service and daily alcohol consumption were associated with noise-induced hearing impairment both in restaurant workers and entertainment employees.CONCLUSION: Excessive noise exposure is common in the Chinese restaurant and entertainment industries and a substantial proportion of restaurant workers and entertainment employees suffer from NIHL. Comprehensive hearing conservation programs should be introduced to the service industry in Hong Kong."

Hearing and neurobehavioral functions were evaluated. Serum neurotransmitters were also determined.RESULTS: The prevalence of hearing loss was much higher in petrochemical groups than that in power station and control groups (P &lt; 0.05). Compared with the control group, scores of neurobehavioral function reflecting learning and memory were decreased in petrochemical workers (P &lt; 0.05), as well as acetylcholinesterase activity. Negative correlation was shown between neurobehavioral function and acetylcholinesterase.CONCLUSIONS: Ethylbenzene exposure might be associated with hearing loss, neurobehavioral function impairment, and imbalance of neurotransmitters."
"23967944","Acoustical correlates of performance on a dynamic range compression discrimination task.","Dynamic range compression is widely used to reduce the difference between the most and least intense portions of a signal. Such compression distorts the shape of the amplitude envelope of a signal, but it is unclear to what extent such distortions are actually perceivable by listeners. Here, the ability to distinguish between compressed and uncompressed versions of a noise vocoded sentence was initially measured in listeners with normal hearing while varying the threshold, ratio, attack, and release parameters. This narrow condition was selected in order to characterize perception under the most favorable listening conditions. The average behavioral sensitivity to compression was highly correlated to several acoustical indices of modulation depth. In particular, performance was highly correlated to the Euclidean distance between the modulation spectra of the uncompressed and compressed signals. Suggesting that this relationship is not restricted to the initial test conditions, the correlation remained largely unchanged both (1) when listeners with normal hearing were tested using a time-compressed version of the original signal, and (2) when listeners with impaired hearing were tested using the original signal. If this relationship generalizes to more ecologically valid conditions, it will provide a straightforward method for predicting the detectability of compression-induced distortions. "
"23887702","Hearing loss and use of hearing protection among career firefighters in the United States.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and characteristics of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and the use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) among career firefighters.METHODS: A Web-based survey and a standard audiometric test were performed with 425 firefighters from three states in the United States.RESULTS: More than 40% showed hearing loss in the noise-sensitive frequencies (4 and 6 kHz). The left ear showed significantly poorer hearing than the right ear. Firefighters having longer years of work in fire services demonstrated significantly worse hearing. Reported use of HPDs was 34% of the time that was needed. Firefighters who used HPDs less were significantly more likely to have hearing loss.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a considerable NIHL problem and low use of HPDs in firefighters. More comprehensive hearing conservation programs should be implemented to reduce NIHL for firefighters."

The 1st group was exposed to acoustic trauma, the 2nd group was treated with ozone initially, and was exposed to acoustic trauma 24 h later, the 3rd group received ozone without trauma, while the 4th group was the control group. The 1st and 2nd groups were exposed to acoustic trauma with 105 dB SPL white band noise for 4h. DPOAE and ABR tests were conducted in all groups on the 1st, 5th, and 10th days after trauma.RESULTS: In the 1st group, the effects of acoustic trauma continued on days 1, 5 and 10. The 2nd group's DPOAE and ABR results on days 5 and 10 showed significant improvement at all frequencies compared to deterioration on day 1, and the readings were comparable to baseline measurements.CONCLUSION: Acoustic trauma is a pathology that is experienced frequently and leads to many problems in terms of health and cost. Ozone was demonstrated to be a reparative substance against acoustic trauma and, in addition, it can be supplied and applied easily."

"23819619","Speech-in-noise screening tests by internet, part 3: test sensitivity for uncontrolled parameters in domestic usage.","OBJECTIVE: The online speech-in-noise test 'Earcheck' is sensitive for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). This study investigates effects of uncontrollable parameters in domestic self-screening, such as presentation level and transducer type, on speech reception thresholds (SRTs) obtained with Earcheck.DESIGN: Subjects performed 26 Earchecks that differed regarding presentation level (65, 71, and 77 dBA), presentation mode (monotic or diotic), and masking noise (two different low-pass filtered noises) in the lab. To investigate effects of test environment, participants conducted eight additional Earchecks at home using different transducer types (headphones or loudspeakers).STUDY SAMPLE: Thirty noise-exposed workers, either normal-hearing (n = 10), or with different degrees of NIHL (n = 20), participated.RESULTS: There was a minor effect of presentation levels exceeding 65 dBA in severely impaired listeners. Diotic presentation mode yielded lower SRTs compared to monotic presentation mode. Normal-hearing test results at home were poorer than in the laboratory, whereas hearing-impaired subjects performed better in domestic testing. Using loudspeakers deteriorated SRTs significantly in comparison to headphones, but only in hearing-impaired subjects.CONCLUSIONS: A monotic presentation mode using headphones is recommended for domestic screening. Since domestic testing affects SRT results, a follow up study using a large study population should assess Earcheck's validity when performed at home."
"23812554","Evaluation of early hearing damage in personal listening device users using extended high-frequency audiometry and otoacoustic emissions.","Although sound exposure from personal listening devices (PLDs) could potentially lead to noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), the actual hearing risk associated with the use of these devices is still unclear. In this study, early hearing effects related to PLD usage were evaluated in 35 young adult PLD users (listening for &gt;1 h/day, at &gt;50% of the maximum volume setting of their devices) and their age- and sex-matched controls using a combination of conventional and extended high-frequency audiometry as well as transient-evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) and distortion product of otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) measurements. The mean listening duration of the PLD users was 2.7  1.0 h/day while their estimated average listening volume was 81.3  9.0 dBA (free-field corrected). Typical signs of NIHL were not detected in the audiogram of PLD users and their audiometric thresholds at most of the conventional test frequencies (0.25-8 kHz) were comparable with those obtained from controls. However, compared with the controls, mean hearing thresholds of PLD users at many of the extended high-frequencies (9-16 kHz) were significantly higher. In addition, TEOAE and DPOAE amplitudes in users were reduced compared with controls. The deterioration of extended high-frequency thresholds and the decrease in DPOAE amplitudes were more evident in the users' right ears. These results indicate the presence of an early stage of hearing damage in the PLD user group. Preventive steps should be taken as the initial hearing damage in these users could eventually progress into permanent NIHL after many years of PLD use."
"23811690","Noise-induced hearing loss in workers exposed to urban stressors.","The technological and industrial progress together with the intensification of vehicular traffic and the adoption of new social habits are the cause of an increasing noise pollution with possible negative effects on the auditory system. This study aims to assess the noise exposure levels and the effects on the hearing threshold in outdoor and indoor male workers of a big Italian city. The study was carried out on 357 outdoor male workers, exposed to urban noise and on a control group of 357 unexposed indoor workers. Noise levels were measured in 30 outdoor and indoor areas. The subjects underwent tonal liminal audiometry in order to determine the value of their hearing threshold. During their working activity, outdoor and indoor workers are exposed to different noise levels LEX&lt;80 dB(A). At mid-low frequencies (250-2000 Hz), the results show significant differences in the average values of hearing threshold between the two groups in both ears and for all age classes; there are no significant differences between the two groups at higher frequencies. The outdoor noise levels measured are not usually ototoxic and the hearing loss at mid-low frequencies is not characteristic of the exposure to industrial noise. For these reasons the Authors hypothesize that the results may be due to the combined effect of the exposure to noise and to ototoxic air pollutants. The impairment of speech frequencies is disabling and involves the risk of missed forensic recognition."
"23800806","Hearing conservation program for marching band members: a risk for noise-induced hearing loss?","PURPOSE: To examine the risk for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in university marching band members and to provide an overview of a hearing conservation program for a marching band.METHOD: Sound levels during band rehearsals were recorded and audiometric hearing thresholds and transient otoacoustic emission were measured over a 3-year period. Musician's earplugs and information about hearing loss were provided to the students. The hearing thresholds of other college students were tested as a partial control.RESULTS: There were no significant differences in hearing thresholds between the two groups. During initial testing, more marching band members showed apparent high-frequency notches than control students. Follow-up hearing tests in a subsequent year for the marching band members showed that almost all notches disappeared. Persistent standard threshold shift (STS) across tests was not observed in the band members.CONCLUSION: Band members showed no evidence of STS or persistent notched audiograms. Because accepted procedures for measuring hearing showed a lack of precision in reliably detecting early NIHL in marching band members, it is recommended that signs of NIHL be sought in repeated measurements compared to baseline audiograms rather than in a single measure (a single notch). A hearing conservation program for this population is still recommended because of lengthy rehearsal times with high sound-level exposure during rehearsals."
"23792074","Prophylactic and therapeutic functions of drug combinations against noise-induced hearing loss.","Noise is the most common occupational and environmental hazard. Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is the second most common form of sensorineural hearing deficit, after age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Although promising approaches have been identified for reducing NIHL, currently there are no effective medications to prevent NIHL. Development of an efficacious treatment has been hampered by the complex array of cellular and molecular pathways involved in NIHL. We turned this difficulty into an advantage by asking whether NIHL could be effectively prevented by targeting multiple signaling pathways with a combination of drugs already approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We previously found that antiepileptic drugs blocking T-type calcium channels had both prophylactic and therapeutic effects for NIHL. NIHL can also be reduced by an up-regulation of glucocorticoid (GC) signaling pathways. Based on these findings, we tested a combination therapy for NIHL that included ethosuximide and zonisamide (anticonvulsants) and dexamethasone and methylprednisolone (synthetic GCs) in mice under exposure conditions typically associated with dramatic permanent threshold shifts (PTS). We first examined possible prophylactic effects for each drug when administered alone 2h before noise, and calculated the median effective dose (ED50). We then tested for synergistic effects of two-drug combinations (anticonvulsant+GC), and identified combinations with the strongest synergy against NIHL, based on a previously established combination index (CI) metric. We repeated similar tests to determine their therapeutic effects when administered the same drugs 24h after the noise exposure. Our study shows the feasibility of developing pharmacological intervention in multiple pathways, and discovering drug combinations with optimal synergistic effects in preventing permanent NIHL. "

"23782715","Efficient hearing screening in noise-exposed listeners using the digit triplet test.","OBJECTIVES: Hearing screening in occupational medicine is generally based on pure-tone threshold audiometry. However, reliable and valid thresholds can only be obtained in a sound-proof room, using a high-quality, well-calibrated audiometer, and by a well-trained administrator. Thresholds also need to be determined for several audiometric frequencies. This makes the test time-consuming and expensive, which is not ideal for the screening of large populations. A Speech-In-Noise test (SPIN), by contrast, does not have the abovementioned requirements. Because it can be implemented as a quick automated self-test, possibly over the Internet, a SPIN test is highly advantageous for screening purposes. However, its sensitivity for (isolated) high-frequency hearing loss, as typically seen in noise-exposed listeners, was unclear up to present. In this study, the authors investigated the sensitivity and specificity of the Digit Triplet SPIN test for detecting and monitoring (early-stage) high-frequency hearing loss, and its similarity across two different language versions.DESIGN: One-hundred eighteen noise-exposed workers, representing a wide range from no to severe high-frequency hearing loss, completed the French or Dutch version of the broadband Digit Triplet self-test in an office-like room. Pure-tone thresholds, collected by a professional audiologist in favorable settings, served as the reference.RESULTS: The 84 Dutch-speaking participants showed a very strong linear relation between the reference and the Digit Triplet test, with the pure-tone average at 2, 3, 4, and 6 kHz as a strong predictor (R = 0.86) for the speech-reception threshold. The sensitivity and specificity to detect mild high-frequency hearing loss were 92% (61 of 66) and 89% (16 of 18), respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was very high (=0.91) for several degrees of high-frequency hearing loss. With a within-subject standard deviation of only 0.8 dB, the Digit Triplet test also had a low measurement error. The results of the 34 French-speaking subjects showed a highly similar trend.CONCLUSIONS: The Digit Triplet test proves to have a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting different degrees of high-frequency hearing loss. Given its ease of use, this test is very suitable for screening purposes in occupational medicine, and potentially for the screening of adolescents at risk of recreational noise-induced hearing loss."
"23772828","The applicability of a speech-in-noise screening test in occupational hearing conservation.","OBJECTIVE: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is the most reported occupational health disease in the Netherlands. The internet-based speech-in-noise test Earcheck (Albrecht et al, 2005; Leensen et al, 2011b) is designed to detect beginning NIHL and can be a valuable tool in occupational hearing health surveillance. The aim of this study is to investigate the validity of Earcheck compared to regular screening audiometry.DESIGN: Subjects performed online Earcheck tests at home. The results are compared to a pure-tone screening audiogram obtained during regular occupational health examination. A subgroup performed the measurements twice to assess test-retest reliability.STUDY SAMPLE: Two hundred and forty-nine male construction employees who recently had a periodic occupational health examination participated.RESULTS: An average learning effect of -1.6 dB was found, that reduced with increasing test number. The test-retest variability was 1.6 dB. Sensitivity to detect beginning NIHL was 68%, with a specificity of 71%.CONCLUSIONS: Although sensitivity and specificity values are only moderate, the broad internet application still promises a valuable addition to current practice. The relatively high learning effect indicates that more reliable results can be obtained after a longer test session. When this is put into practice some improvement in sensitivity and specificity may be expected as well."
"23771423","Auditory risk assessment of college music students in jazz band-based instructional activity.","It is well-known that musicians are at risk for music-induced hearing loss, however, systematic evaluation of music exposure and its effects on the auditory system are still difficult to assess. The purpose of the study was to determine if college students in jazz band-based instructional activity are exposed to loud classroom noise and consequently exhibit acute but significant changes in basic auditory measures compared to non-music students in regular classroom sessions. For this we (1) measured and compared personal exposure levels of college students (n = 14) participating in a routine 50 min jazz ensemble-based instructional activity (experimental) to personal exposure levels of non-music students (n = 11) participating in a 50-min regular classroom activity (control), and (2) measured and compared pre- to post-auditory changes associated with these two types of classroom exposures. Results showed that the L eq (equivalent continuous noise level) generated during the 50 min jazz ensemble-based instructional activity ranged from 95 dBA to 105.8 dBA with a mean of 99.5  2.5 dBA. In the regular classroom, the L eq ranged from 46.4 dBA to 67.4 dBA with a mean of 49.9  10.6 dBA. Additionally, significant differences were observed in pre to post-auditory measures between the two groups. The experimental group showed a significant temporary threshold shift bilaterally at 4000 Hz (P &lt; 0.05), and a significant decrease in the amplitude of transient-evoked otoacoustic emission response in both ears (P &lt; 0.05) after exposure to the jazz ensemble-based instructional activity. No significant changes were found in the control group between pre- and post-exposure measures. This study quantified the noise exposure in jazz band-based practice sessions and its effects on basic auditory measures. Temporary, yet significant, auditory changes seen in music students place them at risk for hearing loss compared to their non-music cohorts."
"23697692","Prevalence of systemic arterial hypertension, electrocardiogram abnormalities, and noise-induced hearing loss in agricultural workers.","ABSTRACT The literature suggests that farmers nowadays are more likely to contract cardiovascular diseases than in the past. This study involved 79 farmers and 64 controls. The workers completed a questionnaire to identify exclusion factors for audiological and cardiovascular risk factors. The participants underwent medical examination, measurement of blood pressure, electrocardiogram, blood tests, audiometry, and measurement of noise exposure. The farmers were found to have a higher prevalence of systolic and diastolic arterial hypertension as well as electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities compared with the controls. A significant prevalence of arterial hypertension was detected in the farmers exposed to noise, when compared with those who were not exposed. These results suggest that farmers are at risk of cardiovascular effects and that noise is a cardiovascular risk factor for farmers."
"23691834","Occupational noise-induced hearing loss in Indian steel industry workers: an exploratory study.","OBJECTIVE: The present study focused on exploring the current level of hearing protection and subsequently determined the prevalence of occupational noise-induced hearing loss among casting and forging industry workers.BACKGROUND: The casting and forging industry provides employment to a significant portion of the population.METHOD: The level of hearing protection was assessed through questionnaire survey of 572 workers. Out of these workers, 165 and another control group of 57 participants were assessed by formal audiometry. Audiometric tests were conducted at frequencies of 1.0 KHz to 8.0 KHz.The occurrence of hearing loss was determined on the basis of a hearing threshold level with a low fence of 25 dB. Student's test and ANOVA were used to compare the various groups; a p value &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTS: More than 90% of the workers sampled showed significant hearing loss at medium and high frequencies. The analyses revealed a higher prevalence of significant hearing loss among the forging workers compared with the workers associated with the other activities.CONCLUSIONS: The workers of the Indian steel industry are highly exposed to occupational noise. The majority of workers are not protected from noise-induced hearing loss. There is a need to provide special ear protectors for workers engaged in forging. A complete hearing protection program, including training, audiometry, job rotation, and the use of hearing protection devices, needs to be introduced."
"23689297","Interleukin-1 gene polymorphism and hearing loss related to the history of occupational noise exposure in Brazilian elderly.","Hearing loss is the most common sensory impairment in older people, and may have social and psychological consequences, such as social isolation, frustration and depression. Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is an interaction of both genetic and environmental factors. Some studies have led to the identification of possible NIHL susceptibility genes. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the polymorphism of the interleukin (IL)-1 gene at position + 3954 was associated with complaints of hearing loss due to occupational exposure. The sample was composed of elderly people with hearing loss (age = 60 years) divided into two groups: 99 with occupational exposure to noise and 193 without exposure. Information on occupational exposure to noise was obtained through interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire. Hearing acuity was measured from 500 to 6000 Hz and the IL-1 genotype was obtained by the polymerase chain reaction- restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. Differences in allelic and genotypic frequencies, and the association between genotypic frequencies and complaints of hearing loss due to occupational exposure, were analyzed by the Chi-square test at the 5% significance level. Fifty-one percent of the elderly were homozygous for the ancestral allele (C), 17.2% were homozygous for the polymorphic allele (T) and 31.8% were heterozygous. The frequency was found to be 67-33% C to allele T. There was no significant association between polymorphism in gene IL-1 and hearing loss associated with occupational exposure (<U+03C7>2 = 0.538; P = 0.676). No association was found with the polymorphism of the IL-1 +3954 C/T gene and hearing loss associated with the occupational noise exposure history."
"23650771","[The influence of organic solvents on hearing and balance: a literature review].","This manuscript presents an overview of current knowledge on the influence of organic solvents on the hearing and balance systems. The authors analyzed--the literature data concerning the results of all human and the most relevant animal studies, published untill 2012. Moreover, the guidelines for occupational medicine specialists were proposed on the basis of literature review and the authors' own scientific experience. The literature data and our studies revealed the increased risk of hearing loss in workers exposed to organic solvents only, and well documented potentiation of harmful effects of combinedexposure to organic solvents and noise. Hearing impairment is mainly observed in high frequencies, but lower frequencies can also be involved (0.5-4 kHz). The impairment induced by exposure to organic solvents is mild, up to several dBs. In the combined exposure to noise and solvents, the noise effect predominates. Organic solvents affect the central pathways of vestibular system although unilateral or bilateral vestibular hypofunction might also be a possible consequence of solvent exposure. Occupational exposure to organic solvents is a risk factor for hearing and balance impairments. Therefore, workers exposed to solvents should be covered by hearing loss prevention programs. Speech in noise test (HINT) and posturography seem to be the most suitable tests for hearing and balance prevention programme for organic solvent exposed workers."

"23529883","Determinants of bilateral audiometric notches in noise-induced hearing loss.","HYPOTHESIS: To explore the possible determinants of bilateral audiometric notches in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).STUDY DESIGN: Prospectively enrolled cohort with cross-sectional analysis.METHODS: Male workers (n = 412) with exposure to continuous loud noise (noise exposure level normalized to a nominal 8-hour working day &gt;75 dBA) during work were included in this cohort study. The relationship between the presence of bilateral audiometric notches and age, noise exposure duration, noise exposure level, and shift from the predicted thresholds over different frequencies were determined by regression model analysis, receiver operating characteristic analysis, and area under the curve analysis.RESULTS: The presence of bilateral audiometric notches was closely associated with the shifts from the predicted thresholds over 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 kHz. The shift pattern was somewhat different between those who used hearing protection devices and those who did not. The shifts from the predicted thresholds demonstrated a stronger association with bilateral audiometric notches than did age, gender, noise exposure level, or noise exposure duration.CONCLUSIONS: The bilateral audiometric notches in NIHL could not be determined only on the basis of age, gender, noise exposure level, or noise exposure duration. The importance of other factors associated with bilateral audiometric notches should be recognized. Elucidation of the factors of formation of bilateral audiometric notches would help us to develop a more comprehensive protection strategy to prevent further NIHL."
"23521627","Review of interventions to increase hearing protective device use in youth who live or work on farms.","AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To identify and compare hearing protection interventions for youth working and living on farms.BACKGROUND: Noise-induced hearing loss represents a significant risk factor for injury, disability and death in agricultural populations due to an inability to receive sensory information that can indicate dangerous situations. Despite the availability of hearing protection devices, rates of utilisation remain low, while rates of noise-induced hearing loss are high within the agricultural youth population.DESIGN: Comprehensive review of the literature.METHOD: Electronic database searches were conducted to identify research studies of hearing protection interventions for youth living or working on farms.RESULTS: Three intervention studies were identified as meeting the review criteria, with additional reanalysis studies based on the original intervention studies. The intervention studies demonstrated increased use of hearing protection devices among youth who received the interventions compared to the control groups although audiometry testing results were not improved as a result of the intervention.CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this review highlight the need for additional research into the effectiveness of hearing protection device use as a noise-induced hearing loss preventative measure in youth who live or work on farms and the creation of effective interventions to increase hearing protection device use and decrease Noise-induced hearing loss risk.RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is recommended that nurses be educated in the areas of health promotion relevant to farming communities to be able to effectively meet their rural clients' needs in relation to noise-induced hearing loss. Working with youth, families, and schools, as well as developing community partnerships, can facilitate the dissemination of hearing protection promotion."
"23518255","Effect of noise on auditory processing in the operating room.","BACKGROUND: Effective communication is a critical component of patient care in the operative room (OR). However, the presence of loud equipment, a large number of staff members, and music can contribute to high levels of background noise. In a setting in which crucial tasks are performed continuously, distractions and barriers to communication can result in harm to both patients and OR personnel. The purpose of this investigation was to simulate OR listening conditions and evaluate the effect of operating noise on auditory function.STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective investigation of 15 subjects ranging from 1 to 30 years of operative experience. All surgeons had normal peripheral hearing sensitivity. The surgeons' ability to understand and repeat words were tested using the Speech in Noise Test-Revised in 4 different conditions chosen to simulate typical OR environments. These included quiet, filtered noise through a mask and background noise both with and without music. They were tested in both a tasked and in an untasked situation.RESULTS: It was found that the impact of noise is considerably greater when the participant is tasked. Surgeons demonstrated substantially poorer auditory performance in music than in quiet or OR noise. Performance in both conditions was poorer when the sentences were low in predictability.CONCLUSIONS: Operating room noise can cause a decrease in auditory processing function, particularly in the presence of music. This becomes even more difficult when the communication involves conversations that carry critical information that is unpredictable. To avoid possible miscommunication in the OR, attempts should be made to reduce ambient noise levels."

Bilateral audiograms from 1,000,001 veterans were obtained from Department of Veterans Affairs archives; after &quot;cleaning&quot; algorithms were applied, 744,553 participants (mean age = 63.5 yr) were included in the 4,000 Hz notch analysis (group 1) and 539,932 participants (mean age = 62.2 yr) were included in the 3,000, 4,000, and/or 6,000 Hz notch analysis (group 2). A notch was defined when the threshold at the notch frequency (3,000, 4,000, or 6,000 Hz) minus the 2,000 Hz threshold and the threshold at the notch frequency minus the 8,000 Hz threshold both were greater than or equal to 10 dB. In group 1, 77.1% did not have a notch at 4,000 Hz. In group 2, 65.3% did not have a notch at 3,000, 4,000, or 6,000 Hz; 12.4% had bilateral notches, 11.7% had left ear notches, and 10.7% had right ear notches. The notches were about twice as deep on the low-frequency side of the notch than on the high-frequency side. The mean left ear and right ear notch depths were about the same (23 dB), with mode notch depths in the 15.0 to 17.5 dB range."

"23418634","The cerebellum as a novel tinnitus generator.","The role of the cerebellum in auditory processing is largely unknown. Recently it was shown that rats with psychophysical evidence of tinnitus had significantly elevated neural activity in the paraflocculus of the cerebellum (PFL), as indicated by functional imaging. It was further shown that PFL activity was not elevated in normal rats listening to a tinnitus-like sound. This suggests that plastic changes in the PFL may underpin chronic tinnitus, i.e., it may serve as a tinnitus generator. Using a rat model of acoustic trauma-induced tinnitus, the role of the cerebellum was further examined in a series of experiments:The PFL was surgically ablated in animals with established tinnitus; the PFL was surgically ablated in animals before induction of tinnitus; the PFL was reversibly inactivated by chronic lidocaine infusion into the subarcuate fossa of animals with established tinnitus. It was found that PFL ablation eliminated established tinnitus without altering auditory discrimination. Similar to the ablation results, PFL inactivation with lidocaine reversibly eliminated existing tinnitus. In contrast however, PFL ablation before tinnitus induction attenuated, but did not completely eliminate, tinnitus. In a rat model of noise-induced chronic tinnitus, the cerebellar PFL may serve as a sufficient but non-obligatory generator of tinnitus."

A randomly assigned subset (N = 24) of participants had their listening monitored by dosimetry for one week.RESULTS: Median weekly noise doses reported and measured through dosimetry were low (9-93%), but 14.3% of participants reported exceeding a 100% noise dose weekly. When measured by dosimetry, 16.7% of participants exceeded a 100% noise dose weekly. The self-report question that best predicted the dosimetry-measured dose asked participants to report listening duration and usual listening level on a visual-analog scale.CONCLUSIONS: This study reports a novel dosimetry system that can provide accurate measures of PLD use over time. When not feasible, though, the self-report question described could provide a useful research or clinical tool to estimate exposure from PLD use. Among the participants in this study, a small but substantial percentage of PLD users incurred exposure from PLD use alone that increases their risk of music-induced hearing loss."
"23394342","Incidence of high-frequency hearing loss after microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm.","OBJECT: The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and discuss the pathogenesis of high-frequency hearing loss (HFHL) after microvascular decompression (MVD) for hemifacial spasm (HFS).METHODS: Preoperative and postoperative audiogram data and brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) from 94 patients who underwent MVD for HFS were analyzed. Pure tone audiometry at 0.25-2 kHz, 4 kHz, and 8 kHz was calculated for all individuals pre- and postoperatively ipsilateral and contralaterally. Intraoperative neurophysiological data were reviewed independently. An HFHL was defined as a change in pure tone audiometry of more than 10 dB at frequencies of 4 and 8 kHz.RESULTS: The incidence of HFHL was 50.00% and 25.53% ipsilateral and contralateral to the side of surgery, respectively. The incidence of HFHL adjusted for conductive and nonserviceable hearing loss was 26.6% ipsilaterally. The incidence of HFHL at 4 and 8 kHz on the ipsilateral side was 37.23% and 45.74%, respectively, and it was 10.64% and 25.53%, respectively, on the contralateral side. Maximal change in interpeak latency Waves I-V compared with baseline was the only variable significantly different between groups (p &lt; 0.05). Sex, age, and side did not increase the risk of HFHL. Stepwise logistic regression analysis did not find any changes in intraoperative BAEPs to increase the risk of HFHL.CONCLUSIONS: High-frequency hearing loss occurs in a significant number of patients following MVD surgery for HFS. Drill-induced noise and transient loss of CSF during surgery may impair hearing in the high-frequency ranges on both the ipsilateral and contralateral sides, with the ipsilateral side being more affected. Changes in intraoperative BAEPs during MVD for HFS were not useful in predicting HFHL. Follow-up studies and repeat audiological examinations may be helpful in evaluating the time course and prognosis of HFHL. Prospective studies focusing on decreasing intraoperative noise exposure, as well as auditory shielding devices, will establish causation and allow the team to intervene appropriately to decrease the risk of HFHL."

Participants were matched in terms of age and sex. The subjects were assessed in terms of: pure tone audiometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions, suppression of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions in contralateral noise and auditory processing task performance (i.e. masking, frequency discrimination, auditory attention and speech-in-noise).RESULTS: All subjects had normal pure tone audiometry and transient evoked otoacoustic emissions amplitudes in both ears. The noise-exposed aircrew had similar pure tone audiometry thresholds to controls, but right ear transient evoked otoacoustic emissions were larger and speech-in-noise thresholds were elevated in the noise-exposed subjects compared to controls.CONCLUSION: The finding of poorer speech-in-noise perception may reflect noise-related impairment of auditory processing in retrocochlear pathways. Audiometry may not detect early, significant noise-induced hearing impairment."
"23324255","Auditory dysfunction associated with solvent exposure.","BACKGROUND: A number of studies have demonstrated that solvents may induce auditory dysfunction. However, there is still little knowledge regarding the main signs and symptoms of solvent-induced hearing loss (SIHL). The aim of this research was to investigate the association between solvent exposure and adverse effects on peripheral and central auditory functioning with a comprehensive audiological test battery.METHODS: Seventy-two solvent-exposed workers and 72 non-exposed workers were selected to participate in the study. The test battery comprised pure-tone audiometry (PTA), transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE), Random Gap Detection (RGD) and Hearing-in-Noise test (HINT).RESULTS: Solvent-exposed subjects presented with poorer mean test results than non-exposed subjects. A bivariate and multivariate linear regression model analysis was performed. One model for each auditory outcome (PTA, TEOAE, RGD and HINT) was independently constructed. For all of the models solvent exposure was significantly associated with the auditory outcome. Age also appeared significantly associated with some auditory outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence of the possible adverse effect of solvents on the peripheral and central auditory functioning. A discussion of these effects and the utility of selected hearing tests to assess SIHL is addressed."

Four (50%) studies found that noise exposure damages the auditory system in this population.DISCUSSION:  These findings indicate that there is a necessity for preventive measures to be adopted by this population since it is considered to be at risk.CONCLUSION:  In recent years, there have been few studies of firefighters' exposure to occupational noise, but our findings show the importance of new studies that include proper means of quantifying their exposure to noise in different work environments, in order to identify possible adverse conditions as well as to aid in the diagnosis of hearing loss."
"25549167","Short-term music-induced hearing loss after sound exposure to discotheque music: the effectiveness of a break in reducing temporary threshold shift.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a break in music exposure on temporary threshold shifts.DESIGN: A cross-over design where subjects are exposed to dance music for either two hours consecutively, or exposed to two hours of dance music with a one-hour break in between. Outcome measure was the change in hearing threshold, measured in 1-dB steps at different time points after ending the music.STUDY SAMPLE: Eighteen normal-hearing subjects participated in this study.RESULTS: Changes in pure-tone threshold were observed in both conditions and were similar, regardless of the break. Threshold shifts could be averaged for 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. The shift immediately after the ending of the music was 1.7 dB for right ears, and 3.4 dB for left ears. The difference between left and right ears was significant. One hour after the exposure, right ears were recovered to baseline conditions whereas left ears showed a small but clinically irrelevant remaining shift of approximately 1 dB.CONCLUSIONS: The advice to use chill-out zones is still valid, because this helps to reduce the duration to the exposure. This study does not provide evidence that a rest period gives an additional reduction of temporary threshold shifts."

These data support the use of noise bands, preferably ERB noises, as stimuli for audiometric monitoring."

"25515180","Is it reasonable to use 1 and 8 kHz anchor points in the medico-legal diagnosis and estimation of noise-induced hearing loss?","BACKGROUND: In the United Kingdom, use of 1 and 8 kHz as anchor point frequencies has been recommended for the medico-legal diagnosis and estimation of noise-induced hearing loss. There appear to be four assumptions behind the use of 1 and 8 kHz anchor point approach: (i) The frequencies of 1 and 8 kHz are not damaged by noise; therefore, the measured hearing thresholds at the said frequencies solely reflect age-related hearing loss, even in the noise-exposed; (ii) The hearing thresholds at 1 and 8 kHz are a valid predictor of the likely age-related hearing loss thresholds at the other frequencies; (iii) Age and noise damage are always completely additive; (iv) Individual's susceptibility to age and noise damage is not proportionate. Doubts have been expressed in the medical circles about the legitimacy and validity of their use as anchor points.OBJECTIVE OF REVIEW: Is it reasonable to use 1 and 8 kHz anchor points in the medico-legal diagnosis and estimation of noise-induced hearing loss?TYPE OF REVIEW: Medico-legal.SEARCH STRATEGY: Literature search; Medline, Embase, Internet, and medico-legal records.EVALUATION METHOD: Equating and comparing the assumptions in the anchor point approach with the information in medical literature.RESULTS: Based upon the information in medical literature, technical reports, and professional statements, the assumptions behind the use of anchor point approach cannot be reliably substantiated.CONCLUSIONS: 'Carte Blanche' use of 1 and 8 kHz anchor points is probably unreasonable and may well be unsafe in the medico-legal diagnosis and estimation of noise-induced hearing loss."

Data were analysed using non-parametric tests and Student's t-test.STUDY SAMPLE: There were 212 workers.RESULTS: Ninety-seven subjects were smokers and 115 individuals were non-smokers. All subjects were exposed to 92.1  2.4 dBA (Leq8h). The highest threshold in conventional and high-frequency audiometry was observed at 6 kHz and 16 kHz, respectively. Hearing threshold at frequencies above 1 kHz was significantly higher in the smokers than non-smokers. There was no correlation between hearing thresholds and pack-years of smoking.CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent exposure to noise and smoking may be associated with more hearing loss than exposure to noise alone in the conventional and high frequencies. However, other differences between smokers and non-smokers may explain these differences as well."
"25470371","The prevalence of notched audiograms in a cross-sectional study of 12,055 railway workers.","OBJECTIVE: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is one of the most reported occupational diseases internationally. The occurrence of audiometric notches is emphasized in both American and European guidelines for the diagnosis of NIHL. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of notched audiograms among railway personnel with and without noise exposure to better assess the usefulness of such notches in the diagnosis of NIHL.DESIGN: The most recent audiogram from 1994 to 2011 of a total of 12,055 railway workers, age 20 to 65 years, was obtained from the medical records of the occupational health service of the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). The prevalences of three types of notched audiograms, Coles notch, notch index, and 4 kHz notch, were computed, in relation to age, sex, and occupational noise exposure.RESULTS: Coles notch in either ear was found in 63% of the male railway maintenance workers, exposed to noise levels of 75 to 90 dB(A), compared with 53% of the non-noise exposed (&lt;70 dB(A)) traffic controllers (p &lt; 0.001). The corresponding figures for the 4 kHz notch were 31% versus 21% (p &lt; 0.001). For the notch index, 61% of the exposed and 51% of the controls had a notched audiogram (p &lt; 0.001). For female workers, the prevalence of audiometric notches was lower, and the differences between noise exposed and nonexposed was smaller than those in men. Increasing age led to an increased prevalence of notches.CONCLUSIONS: Audiometric notches commonly occur among both noise-exposed and those not exposed to noise in railway personnel. The usefulness of audiometric notches in the diagnosis of NIHL is therefore limited."
"25432298","Prediction of hearing loss among the noise-exposed workers in a steel factory using artificial intelligence approach.","PURPOSE: Prediction of hearing loss in noisy workplaces is considered to be an important aspect of hearing conservation program. Artificial intelligence, as a new approach, can be used to predict the complex phenomenon such as hearing loss. Using artificial neural networks, this study aims to present an empirical model for the prediction of the hearing loss threshold among noise-exposed workers.METHODS: Two hundred and ten workers employed in a steel factory were chosen, and their occupational exposure histories were collected. To determine the hearing loss threshold, the audiometric test was carried out using a calibrated audiometer. The personal noise exposure was also measured using a noise dosimeter in the workstations of workers. Finally, data obtained five variables, which can influence the hearing loss, were used for the development of the prediction model. Multilayer feed-forward neural networks with different structures were developed using MATLAB software. Neural network structures had one hidden layer with the number of neurons being approximately between 5 and 15 neurons.RESULTS: The best developed neural networks with one hidden layer and ten neurons could accurately predict the hearing loss threshold with RMSE = 2.6 dB and R(2) = 0.89. The results also confirmed that neural networks could provide more accurate predictions than multiple regressions.CONCLUSIONS: Since occupational hearing loss is frequently non-curable, results of accurate prediction can be used by occupational health experts to modify and improve noise exposure conditions."
"25387537","A comparison of the effects of solvent and noise exposure on hearing, together and separately.","The objective of the present study was to assess the effects of occupational exposure to noise and organic solvents on hearing loss in bus and truck plant workers. Our case control study contained 469 workers from a bus and truck plant divided into three groups. The first group contained workers exposed to only noise; the second group contained workers exposed to both noise and mixture solvents at a permissible level; and the third group included workers exposed to permissible levels of solvents. The control group (Group 4) included 119 individuals selected randomly, persons who were not exposed to noise and solvents. These groups were compared in terms of each individual's frequency hearing loss in both ears. Our study demonstrates that combined exposure to mixed solvents and noise can exacerbate hearing loss in workers. Hence, a suitable hearing protection program is advised that would contain short-interval audiometric examinations and efficient hearing protectors. "
"25381186","Description and evaluation of a hearing conservation program in use in a professional symphony orchestra.","Professional orchestral musicians risk permanent hearing loss while playing their instruments. Protecting the hearing of these musicians in the workplace is critical to their ongoing ability to play their instruments, but typical workplace hearing conservation measures can have very damaging effects on the product (music) and the musicians' abilities to hear one another sufficiently. To enable effective intervention, orchestras as employers must encourage engagement with hearing protection programs and implement controls while preserving the integrity of the music. To achieve this, typical approaches used in other industries must be redesigned to suit this unique workplace. In response to these challenges, the Queensland Symphony Orchestra (Brisbane, Australia) introduced a comprehensive hearing conservation strategy in 2005 based upon best practice at the time. This strategy-which has been regularly refined-continues to be implemented on a daily basis. This investigation aimed to assess the successes, difficulties, and practical viability of the program. To achieve this a process evaluation was carried out, incorporating archival analyses, player and management focus groups, and an interview with the program's administrator. Results show the program has successfully become integrated into the orchestra's and the musicians' daily operations and significantly contributes to managing the risk of hearing loss in this population. While there is room for improvement in the orchestra's approach-particularly regarding usable personal protective devices and improved education and training, results are encouraging. This study provides a basis for those wishing to implement or evaluate similar paradigms."
"25372170","Audiometric profile of civilian pilots according to noise exposure.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the audiometric profile of civilian pilots according to the noise exposure level.METHODS: This observational cross-sectional study evaluated 3,130 male civilian pilots aged between 17 and 59 years. These pilots were subjected to audiometric examinations for obtaining or revalidating the functional capacity certificate in 2011. The degree of hearing loss was classified as normal, suspected noise-induced hearing loss, and no suspected hearing loss with other associated complications. Pure-tone air-conduction audiometry was performed using supra-aural headphones and acoustic stimulus of the pure-tone type, containing tone thresholds of frequencies between 250 Hz and 6,000 Hz. The independent variables were professional categories, length of service, hours of flight, and right or left ear. The dependent variable was pilots with suspected noise-induced hearing loss. The noise exposure level was considered low/medium or high, and the latter involved periods &gt; 5,000 flight hours and &gt; 10 years of flight service.RESULTS: A total of 29.3% pilots had suspected noise-induced hearing loss, which was bilateral in 12.8% and predominant in the left ear (23.7%). The number of pilots with suspected hearing loss increased as the noise exposure level increased.CONCLUSIONS: Hearing loss in civilian pilots may be associated with noise exposure during the period of service and hours of flight."
"25350439","Doctors' reports of work-related hearing loss.","BACKGROUND: Noise-induced hearing loss is the diagnosis that is most frequently reported to the Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority. The objective of this study was to describe the doctors' reports on noise-induced hearing loss and assess the quality of the information.MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study is based on reports to the Labour Inspection Authority for the years 2005-09. We grouped the reporting incidence according to industry, gender and age on the basis of Statistics Norway's employment statistics. The reports were compared to data from Statistics Norway's living conditions survey from 2009.RESULTS: A total of 7,888 reports had been submitted in the study period (2005-2009), 96% of which concerned men. The annual reporting incidence amounted to 66 per 100,000 employees; six and 120 for women and men respectively. The reporting incidence was highest in the age group 55-74 years and for the construction and manufacturing industries. Altogether 52% of the reports pertained to employees who were no longer working in the enterprise where they had been exposed to noise. The proportion of reports pertaining to employees aged under 40 years was lower than the corresponding proportion of those who reported work-related hearing loss in Statistics Norway's living conditions survey from 2009. Occupational health physicians submitted 85% of the reports.INTERPRETATION: Of those exposed to noise, only a small proportion of women, younger employees and employees in enterprises with no access to occupational health services are captured by the reporting system. The same may apply to employees in industries such as transport and retail trade, but this will require further investigation."
"25335826","Prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss among woodworkers in Nepal: a pilot study.","BACKGROUND: The woodworking industry represents an important cause of occupational noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), a significant yet underappreciated problem in many developing countries.OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence of occupational NIHL among woodworkers in Nepal and measure noise levels at workplaces.METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study with 124 woodworkers (88 carpenters, 36 sawyers), recruited through convenience sampling from 26 workplaces. Pure-tone audiometry between the frequencies 05 and 8 kHz ascertained participants' hearing status, and noise readings were taken at selected workplaces.RESULTS: In all, 31% of carpenters and 44% of sawyers met criteria for NIHL, with 7 and 17% meeting World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for hearing impairment (HI), respectively. Noise levels at various workplaces ranged from 712 to 939 dBA.CONCLUSIONS: Woodworkers in Nepal are at risk of occupational NIHL. As the industry develops, this problem will likely become more extensive, highlighting the need for workplace interventions and additional research."
"25324318","A cross-sectional study of hearing thresholds among 4627 Norwegian train and track maintenance workers.","OBJECTIVE: Railway workers performing maintenance work of trains and tracks could be at risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss, since they are exposed to noise levels of 75-90 dB(A) with peak exposures of 130-140 dB(C). The objective was to make a risk assessment by comparing the hearing thresholds among train and track maintenance workers with a reference group not exposed to noise and reference values from the ISO 1999.DESIGN: Cross-sectional.SETTING: A major Norwegian railway company.PARTICIPANTS: 1897 and 2730 male train and track maintenance workers, respectively, all exposed to noise, and 2872 male railway traffic controllers and office workers not exposed to noise.OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the hearing threshold (pure tone audiometry, frequencies from 0.5 to 8 kHz), and the secondary outcome was the prevalence of audiometric notches (Coles notch) of the most recent audiogram.RESULTS: Train and track maintenance workers aged 45 years or older had a small mean hearing loss in the 3-6 kHz area of 3-5 dB. The hearing loss was less among workers younger than 45 years. Audiometric notches were slightly more prevalent among the noise exposed (59-64%) group compared with controls (49%) for all age groups. They may therefore be a sensitive measure in disclosing an early hearing loss at a group level.CONCLUSIONS: Train and track maintenance workers aged 45 years or older, on average, have a slightly greater hearing loss and more audiometric notches compared with reference groups not exposed to noise. Younger (&lt;45 years) workers have hearing thresholds comparable to the controls."
"25320701","Effect of exposure to a mixture of organic solvents on hearing thresholds in petrochemical industry workers.","INTRODUCTION: Hearing loss is one of the most common occupational diseases. In most workplaces, workers are exposed to noise and solvents simultaneously, so the potential risk of hearing loss due to solvents may be attributed to noise. In this study we aimed to assess the effect of exposure to mixed aromatic solvents on hearing in the absence of exposure to hazardous noise.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 99 workers from the petrochemical industry with exposure to a mixture of organic solvents whose noise exposure was lower than 85 dBA were compared with 100 un-exposed controls. After measuring sound pressure level and mean concentration of each solvent in the workplace, pure-tone-audiometry was performed and the two groups were compared in terms of high-frequency and low-frequency hearing loss. T-tests and Chi-square tests were used to compare the two groups.RESULTS: The mean hearing threshold at all frequencies among petrochemical workers was normal (below 25 dB). We did not observe any significant association between solvent exposure and high-frequency or low-frequency hearing loss.CONCLUSION: This study showed that temporary exposure (less than 4 years) to a mixture of organic solvents, without exposure to noise, does not affect workers' hearing threshold in audiometry tests."

Information on exposure to occupational noise was obtained by interviews. Audiological evaluation was performed using pure tone audiometry and genotyped through PCR by restriction fragment length polymorphism - PCR-RFLP. Data were analyzed using the chi-square test and the odds ratio (OR), with the significance level set at 5%.RESULTS: Among elderly with hearing loss (78.0%), 18.8% had a history of exposure to occupational noise. There was a statistically significant association between the genotype frequencies of the IL-6 -174 and NIHL. The elderly with the CC genotype were less likely to have hearing loss due to occupational noise exposure when compared to those carrying the GG genotype (OR=0.0124; 95% CI 0.0023-0.0671; p&lt;0.001).CONCLUSION: This study suggests there is an association of polymorphisms in the IL-6 gene at position - G174C with susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss."
"25292321","[Diagnostics on noise-induced hearing loss].","Occupational noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) may qualify to compensation and must be distinguished from the ski slope hearing loss (SKI) which is a hereditary type of hearing loss. By combining the NIHL and presbyacusis tables of ISO 1999 it was concluded that in a hearing loss caused solely by noise and ageing the median threshold at 2 kHz is never poorer than 35 dB, and that the ratio between the actual 3 kHz threshold and the average 2-4 kHz threshold does not exceed 1.3. Thus, the audiometric characteristics of the 2-3 kHz segment can distinguish between NIHL and SKI. "

A randomized clinical trial.","BACKGROUND: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is one of the most common occupational diseases and the second most common cause of workers' claims for occupational injuries.OBJECTIVE: Due to high prevalence of NIHL and several reports of improper use of hearing protective devices (HPDs), we conducted this study to compare the effect of face-to-face training in effective use of earplugs with appropriate NRR to overprotection of workers by using earplugs with higher than necessary noise reduction rating (NRR).METHODS: In a randomized clinical trial, 150 workers referred to occupational medicine clinic were randomly allocated to three arms---a group wearing earplugs with an NRR of 25 with no training in appropriate use of the device; a group wearing earplugs with an NRR of 25 with training; another group wearing earplugs with an NRR of 30, with no training. Hearing threshold was measured in the study groups by real ear attenuation at threshold (REAT) method. This trial is registered with Australian New Zealand clinical trials Registry, number ACTRN00363175.RESULTS: The mean  SD age of the participants was 28  5 (range: 19-39) years. 42% of participants were female. The mean noise attenuation in the group with training was 13.88 dB, significantly higher than those observed in other groups. The highest attenuation was observed in high frequencies (4, 6, and 8 kHz) in the group with training.CONCLUSION: Training in appropriate use of earplugs significantly affects the efficacy of earplugs---even more than using an earplug with higher NRR."

Hearing and music exposure in a group of adolescents of a technical high school was assessed at the ages of: 14-15 (test) and 17-18 (retest). The aims of the current study were: (1) To compare the auditory function between test and retest; (2) to compare the musical exposure levels during recreational activities in test and retest; (3) to compare the auditory function with the musical exposure along time in a subgroup of adolescents. The participants in the test were 172 male; in the retest, this number was reduced to 59. At the test and retest the conventional and extended high frequency audiometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) and recreational habits questionnaire were performed. In the test, hearing threshold levels (HTLs) were classified as: Normal (Group 1), slightly shifted (Group 2), and significantly shifted (Group 3); the Musical General Exposure (MGE), categorized in: Low, moderate, high, and very high exposure. The results revealed a significant difference (P &lt; 0.0001) between test and retest in the HTL and global amplitude of TEOAEs in Group 1, showing an increase of the HTL and a decrease TEOAEs amplitude. A subgroup of adolescents, with normal hearing and low exposure to music in the test, showed an increase of the HTL according with the categories of MGE in the retest.

The aims of the current study are: (1) To detect early noise-induced hearing loss among adolescents and establish its relationship with their participation in musical recreational activities and (2) to determine sound immission levels in nightclubs and personal music players (PMPs). The participants consisted in 172 14-15 years old adolescents from a technical high school. Conventional and extended high frequency audiometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions and questionnaire on recreational habits were administered. Hearing threshold levels (HTLs) were classified as: normal (Group 1), slightly shifted (Group 2), and significantly shifted (Group 3). The musical general exposure (MGE), from participation in recreational musical activities, was categorized in low, moderate, and high exposure. The results revealed an increase of HTL in Group 2 compared with Group 1 (P &lt; 0.01), in Group 3 compared with Group 2 (P &lt; 0.05) only in extended high frequency range, in Group 3 compared with Group 1 (P &lt; 0.01).

"25209040","Amplitude variation in calibrated audiometer systems in clinical simulations.","Manual pure tone audiometry is considered to be the gold standard for the assessment of hearing thresholds and has been in consistent use for a long period of time. An increased legislative requirement to monitor and screen workers, and an increasing amount of legislation relating to hearing loss is putting greater reliance on this as a tool. There are a number of questions regarding the degree of accuracy of pure tone audiometry when undertaken in field conditions, particularly relating to the difference in conditions between laboratory calibration and clinical or industrial screening use. This study analyzed the output sound pressure level of four different commercial audiometers, all using TDH39 headphones and each of which had recently undergone calibration at an appropriate laboratory. Levels were measured using a Brul and Kjaer Head and Torso simulator, which accurately replicates the size and shape of a human head, including the ears. A clinical environment was simulated by a trained audiometrist replacing the headphones for each test. Tests were undertaken at three presentation levels, and at the frequencies of 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 4 kHz and 6 kHz. The results showed a high level of test-retest variability, both between different audiometers and within the same audiometer. Maximum variation of sound pressure level at the ear for the same tone presentation was 21 decibels, with a particularly high level of variation at 6 kHz for all meters. An audiometer with attenuating cups exhibited significantly higher variation than ones using supral-aural headphones. Overall the variation exhibited suggests that there is a higher degree of potential error with screening pure tone audiometry than is commonly assumed and that results particularly at the 6 kHz frequency need to be assessed carefully alongside other methods such as speech audiometry.

"25209039","Construction and validation of questionnaire to assess recreational noise exposure in university students.","Recreational noise exposure and its impact on hearing is a problem to which increasing attention is being paid. In Spanish, it is necessary to have a reliable and valid instrument that is capable of describing the extent of noise exposure. The aim was to create and validate an instrument to determine listening habits and levels of recreational noise exposure in young people. We performed a transversal questionnaire validation study using university students. We assessed the validity of the content and appearance of the &quot;Recreational Hearing Habits Questionnaire&quot; (CHAR in Spanish) through experts' judgment. Then we piloted the administration of semantic adaptation with 30 students. Finally, the instrument was applied to 335 Chilean university students, obtaining with these indicators that demonstrated convergent validity of the construct, criterion and reliability. We used exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, as well as correlation and agreement tests. It was confirmed that 14 questions in the questionnaire have a good item-test correlation, having also a factorial structure that indicates the existence of three-dimensions. The questionnaire has good internal consistency and convergent validity with the Noise Exposure Questionnaire. In addition, the score obtained in the CHAR is a predictor of the presence of notch at frequencies of 4 kHz in the right ear and 6 kHz in the left. The CHAR is useful for determining listening habits and thereby recreational noise exposure, indicating good psychometric properties. "

A case of hearing loss after 3 T MRI has been reported in this institution and hence this study. The objective of this study was to determine whether temporary threshold shift (TTS) in high frequency hearing occurs in patients undergoing 3 T MRI scans of the head and neck. A total of 35 patients undergoing head and neck 3 T MRI for various clinical indications were tested with pure tone audiometry in different frequencies including high frequencies, before and after the MRI scan. Any threshold change from the recorded baseline of 10 dB was considered significant. All patients were fitted with foamed 3 M earplugs before the procedure following the safety guidelines for 3 T MRI. The mean time for MRI procedure was 1,672 s (range 1,040-2,810). The noise dose received by each patient amounted to an average of 3,906.29% (1,415-9,170%). The noise dose was derived from a normograph used by Occupational Noise Surveys. This was calculated using the nomograph of L eq, L EX, noise dose and time. There was no statistically significant difference between the hearing threshold before and after the MRI procedures for all the frequencies (paired t test, P &gt; 0.05). For patients using 3 M foamed earplugs, noise level generated by 3 T MRI during routine clinical sequence did not cause any TTS in high frequency hearing."
"25190414","Frequency of greatest temporary hearing threshold shift in harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) depends on the noise level.","Harbor porpoises may suffer hearing loss when they are exposed to high level sounds. After exposure for 60<U+2009>min to a 6.5<U+2009>kHz continuous tone at average received sound pressure levels (SPLav.re.) ranging from 118 to 154<U+2009>dB re 1Pa, the temporary hearing threshold shifts (TTSs) of a harbor porpoise were quantified at the center frequency (6.5 kHz), at 0.5, 1.0, and 1.3 octaves above the center frequency (9.2, 13.0, and 16.0<U+2009>kHz), and at a frequency assumed to be ecologically important for harbor porpoises (125<U+2009>kHz, the center frequency of their echolocation signals) by means of a psychoacoustic technique. The hearing frequency at which the maximum TTS occurred depended on the SPLav.re. The higher the SPLav.re., the higher the TTS induced at frequencies higher than the exposure frequency; below 148 dB re 1<U+2009>Pa, the maximum TTS was at 6.5<U+2009>kHz, whereas above 148<U+2009>dB re 1<U+2009>Pa, the maximum TTS was at 9.2<U+2009>kHz. The hearing threshold of the harbor porpoise for the center frequency of its echolocation signals (125<U+2009>kHz) was not affected at the highest SPLav.re. to which the animal was exposed. "
"25188429","Noise-induced hearing loss: an occupational medicine perspective.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Up to 30 million workers in the United States are exposed to potentially detrimental levels of noise. Although reliable medications for minimizing or reversing noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) are not currently available, NIHL is entirely preventable. The purpose of this article is to review the epidemiology and pathophysiology of occupational NIHL. We will focus on at-risk populations and discuss prevention programs. Current prevention programs focus on reducing inner ear damage by minimizing environmental noise production and through the use of personal hearing protective devices.RECENT FINDINGS: NIHL is the result of a complex interaction between environmental factors and patient factors, both genetic and acquired. The effects of noise exposure are specific to an individual. Trials are currently underway evaluating the role of antioxidants in protection from, and even reversal of, NIHL.SUMMARY: Occupational NIHL is the most prevalent occupational disease in the United States. Occupational noise exposures may contribute to temporary or permanent threshold shifts, although even temporary threshold shifts may predispose an individual to eventual permanent hearing loss. Noise prevention programs are paramount in reducing hearing loss as a result of occupational exposures."
"25144250","The leisure-noise dilemma: hearing loss or hearsay? What does the literature tell us?","The authors undertook a review of the literature, focussing on publications describing the following: (1) Pure tone threshold data for adolescents/young adults; (2) Measurements/estimates of noise exposure from leisure activities; and (3) The relationship between hearing threshold levels (HTLs) and leisure-noise exposure. There is a large volume of published materials relevant to these topics, and opinion among authors regarding the relationship between leisure-noise exposure and HTLs varies significantly. At one extreme is the view that the effects of leisure-noise are minimal. The opposing belief is that as a direct result of leisure-noise exposure, significant HTL shifts and possibly significant hearing disability are occurring in a large (and increasing) proportion of young people. It has been claimed that behaviors relating to leisure-noise are &quot;as threatening to young people's health as more traditional risk behaviors&quot; (, p. 55). This view has been reiterated by the popular media. This review revealed that while sufficient data confirm that some leisure pursuits provide potentially hazardous noise levels, the nature of the exposure-injury relationship for leisure-noise is yet to be determined. Specific information about the quality-of-life effects of threshold shift related to leisure-noise exposure is also lacking.

"25068604","Music listening behavior, health, hearing and otoacoustic emission levels.","This study examined the relationship between hearing levels, otoacoustic emission levels and listening habits related to the use of personal listening devices (PLDs) in adults with varying health-related fitness. Duration of PLD use was estimated and volume level was directly measured. Biomarkers of health-related fitness were co-factored into the analyses. 115 subjects ages 18-84 participated in this study. Subjects were divided into two sub-groups; PLD users and non-PLD users. Both groups completed audiological and health-related fitness tests. Due to the mismatch in the mean age of the PLD user versus the non-PLD user groups, age-adjusted statistics were performed to determine factors that contributed to hearing levels. Age was the most significant predictor of hearing levels across listening and health-related fitness variables. PLD user status did not impact hearing measures, yet PLD users who listened less than 8 hours per week with intensities of less than 80 dBA were found to have better hearing. Other variables found to be associated with hearing levels included: years listening to PLD, number of noise environments and use of ear protection. Finally, a healthy waist-to-hip ratio was a significant predictor of better hearing, while body mass index approached, but did not reach statistical significance. "
"25033789","Comparison of the effects of N-acetyl-cysteine and ginseng in prevention of noise induced hearing loss in male textile workers.","Previous studies revealed the role of antioxidant agents in prevention of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL). The aim of this study was to compare the protective effect of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and ginseng on protection of NIHL in textile workers exposed to continuous noise in daily working. In this study, 48 participants were randomly allocated to three groups; Group I received NAC 1200 mg/day, Group II received ginseng 200 mg/day, and Group III (control group) received no supplement. Pure tone audiometry and high frequency audiometry were performed preshift before and after 14 days (on day 15). Linear regression analysis results showed reduced noise-induced temporary threshold shift (TTS) for NAC and ginseng groups at 4, 6 and 16 kHz (P &lt; 0.001) in both ears. Furthermore, the protective effects were more prominent in NAC than ginseng. Our results show that NAC and ginseng can reduce noise induced TTS in workers exposed to occupational noise. Further studies are needed to prove antioxidants benefits in hearing conservation programs. "
"25028612","Protective effects of Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 against noise trauma-induced hearing loss and tinnitus development.","Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and resulting comorbidities like subjective tinnitus are common diseases in modern societies. A substance shown to be effective against NIHL in an animal model is the Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761. Further effects of the extract on the cellular and systemic levels of the nervous system make it a promising candidate not only for protection against NIHL but also for its secondary comorbidities like tinnitus. Following an earlier study we here tested the potential effectiveness of prophylactic EGb 761 treatment against NIHL and tinnitus development in the Mongolian gerbil. We monitored the effects of EGb 761 and noise trauma-induced changes on signal processing within the auditory system by means of behavioral and electrophysiological approaches. We found significantly reduced NIHL and tinnitus development upon EGb 761 application, compared to vehicle treated animals. These protective effects of EGb 761 were correlated with changes in auditory processing, both at peripheral and central levels. We propose a model with two main effects of EGb 761 on auditory processing, first, an increase of auditory brainstem activity leading to an increased thalamic input to the primary auditory cortex (AI) and second, an asymmetric effect on lateral inhibition in AI.

The control group (n<U+200A>=<U+200A>161) was exposed to noise intensity &lt;85 dB and the exposed group (n<U+200A>=<U+200A>217) was exposed to noise intensity <U+2267>85 dB. A polymerase chain reaction was used to differentiate the various genotypes of ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) and ACE G2350A.RESULTS: Noise significantly increased the likelihood of hypertension. Carriers of the genotypes AG, GG, and DD were vulnerable to hypertension on noise exposure. No association between hypertension and hearing impairment or noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) was found.CONCLUSION: Our results support the association between ACE gene polymorphisms and occurrence of hypertension in noise-exposed workers."

Here, the potential interaction between noise and diet in their association to hearing was examined.DESIGN: This cross-sectional analysis was based on Healthy Eating Index data and audiological threshold pure-tone averages for low (0.5 to 2 kHz) and high (3 to 8 kHz) frequencies.STUDY SAMPLE: Data were drawn from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2002.RESULTS: Controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking we found statistically significant relationships between dietary quality and high-frequency threshold sensitivity as well as noise exposure and high-frequency thresholds. In addition, there was a statistically significant interaction between dietary quality and reported noise exposure with respect to high-frequency threshold sensitivity in participants, where greater reported noise exposure and poorer diet were associated with poorer hearing (p's &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The current findings support an association between healthier eating and better hearing at higher frequencies; the strength of this relationship varied as a function of participant noise history, with the most robust relationship in those that reported military service or firearm use."
"24953884","Occupational hearing loss of market mill workers in the city of Accra, Ghana.","Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) is an irreversible sensorineural hearing loss associated with exposure to high levels of excessive noise. Prevention measures are not well established in developing countries. This comparative cross sectional study aims to determine the prevalence of hearing loss in both a group of high risk workers and a control group and to assess their knowledge of the effects of noise on hearing health. A total of 101 market mill workers and 103 controls employed within markets in the city of Accra, Ghana, were evaluated using a structured questionnaire and pure tone audiometry. The questionnaire assessed factors including self-reported hearing loss, tinnitus, knowledge on the effects of noise on hearing health and the use of hearing protective devices. Pure tone audiometric testing was conducted for both mill workers and controls. Noise levels at the work premises of the mill workers and controls were measured. Symptoms of hearing loss were reported by 24 (23.76%) and 8 (7.7%) mill workers and controls respectively. Fifty-five (54.5%) and fifty-four (52.37%) mill workers and controls exhibited knowledge of the effects of noise on hearing health. Five (5.0%) mill workers used hearing protective devices. There was significant sensorineural hearing loss and the presence of a 4 kHz audiometric notch among mill workers when compared with controls for the mean thresholds of 2 kHz, 3 kHz and 4 kHz (P = 0. 001). The prevalence of hearing loss in the better hearing ears of the mill workers and controls was 24.8% and 4.8% respectively (P &lt; 0.5). The prevalence of hearing loss, which may be characteristic of NIHL in the better hearing ears of the mill workers and controls was 24.8% and 4.8% respectively. The majority of mill workers did not use hearing protection. "
"24953090","Assessment of exposure to voices and noise via earphones in manufacturing industry workers in Japan.","OBJECTIVES: There is concern that sound via earphones and headphones attached to headsets used in workplaces may be a risk factor for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Although there are some previous studies investigating exposure to noise from headphones, almost none have assessed the risks to workers who use earphones. We assessed exposure to noise among workers who regularly wear earphones in noisy workplaces.METHODS: The subjects of this study were 21 workers who regularly wear earphones in three manufacturing companies in Japan. The sound pressure output from earphones and personal exposure to occupational noise was measured for each worker. A noise-dosimeter was used to measure individual exposure to occupational noise. The sound pressure output from the earphones was measured by recording the electric signal with a data recorder attached to the earphones, and the recording was analyzed by playing it back in the laboratory through a sound analyzer via an ear simulator.RESULTS: The mean scores for personal exposure and earphone output LAeq were 87.9 dB and 87.6 dB, respectively. Earphone output LAeq exceeded 85 dB for two-thirds of the subjects. Nearly all the subjects lacked hearing protection devices (HPDs) on their earphones.CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that workers who use earphones in noisy workplaces are exposed to the following NIHL risk factors: (1) they are deprived of the opportunity to fit appropriate HPDs, and (2) the sound pressure output from the earphones themselves exceeds the occupational exposure limit."
"24940310","Prevalence of noise induced hearing loss among employees at a mining industry in Zimbabwe.","BACKGROUND: Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) is within the top five occupational illnesses in Zimbabwe. Workers at a mining company complained about loss of hearing at the mine clinic.OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of NIHL among employees at the Mine.METHODS: We conducted a descriptive cross sectional study at the mine. Workers were proportionally selected to represent all the mine departments or working areas. We measured noise levels at various mine sites, conducted a walk-through survey to observe noise related worker practices and conducted audiometric testing.RESULTS: Mean age for workers was 34.87.6 years and the mean duration of exposure to noise was 7.51.2 years. All workers could define noise. Ninety (53%) workers attributed NIHL to noisy work environment. Excessive noise levels were in Plant Processing (94 dBA), Underground Mining (102 dBA) and (Underground Workshop (103 dBA). Sixty two (36.7%) workers had NIHL. NIHL increased as a function of age (chi square=30.99 df=3 p&lt;0.01) and was associated with work area (chi square=24.96 df=5 p&lt;0.01). Observed workers took heed of noise warnings. There was no documented hearing conservation program at the mine.CONCLUSION: The prevalence of NIHL of 37% is high. Age and work area were associated with NIHL. Studies reported that age tends to distort the relationship between noise exposure and NIHL. Mine management should institute a hearing conservation program to protect employees against hazardous noise. Management may meanwhile use administrative controls and adhere to permissible exposure limits according to the noise regulations."
"24923465","High-frequency hearing thresholds: effects of age, occupational ultrasound and noise exposure.","PURPOSE: It has been suggested that high-frequency audiometry (HFA) could represent a useful preventive measure in exposed workers. The aim was to investigate the effects of age, ultrasound and noise on high-frequency hearing thresholds.METHODS: We tested 24 industrial ultrasound-exposed subjects, 113 industrial noise-exposed subjects and 148 non-exposed subjects. Each subject was tested with both conventional-frequency (0.125-8 kHz) and high-frequency (9-18 kHz) audiometry.RESULTS: The hearing threshold at high frequency deteriorated as a function of age, especially in subjects more than 30 years old. The ultrasound-exposed subjects had significantly higher hearing thresholds than the non-exposed ones at the high frequencies, being greatest from 10 to 14 kHz. This hearing loss was already significantly evident in subjects with exposure &lt;5 years and increased with years of exposure and advancing age. The noise exposure group had significantly higher hearing thresholds than the non-exposed group at the conventional frequencies 4 and 6 kHz and at the high frequency of 14 kHz. After stratification for age, there was a significant difference between the two groups at 9-10 and 14-15 kHz only for those under 30 years of age.CONCLUSION: Multivariate analysis indicated that age was the primary predictor, and noise and ultrasound exposure the secondary predictors of hearing thresholds in the high-frequency range. The results suggest that HFA could be useful in the early diagnosis of noise-induced hearing loss in younger groups of workers (under 30 years of age)."

Despite regulations and preventive measures, noise-induced hearing loss is common. The current reference test is pure-tone air-conduction audiometry (PTA), but this test cannot be used to detect early hearing loss.</AbstractText>: Noise is one of the most pervasive hazards in the workplace. Despite regulations and preventive measures, noise-induced hearing loss is common. The current reference test is pure-tone air-conduction audiometry (PTA), but this test cannot be used to detect early hearing loss.OBJECTIVE: In this study, we assess one-day auditory fatigue using both PTA and efferent reflexes (ER) measured using DPOAEs associated with contralateral acoustic stimulation (CAS DPOAEs).DESIGN: The noise exposure history, PTA, and ER detection were performed in seven different companies where the L(EX,8h) was 85 dB(A). Hearing was tested before and at the end of the working day.STUDY SAMPLE: Forty-six volunteers were selected to carry out this study.RESULTS: After a single working day, a greater impact of noise was measured using ER thresholds than PTA or DPOAEs. ER measurements are objective, easy to perform, and do not require a sound-attenuated booth.CONCLUSION: Screening workers by periodically measuring ER thresholds using CAS DPOAEs helps detect early changes in hearing status, before the onset of noise-induced hearing loss. These tests can be readily applied as part of a hearing conservation program."
"24804714","Asymmetry in noise-induced hearing loss: evaluation of two competing theories.","Competing theories exist about why asymmetry is observed in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). We evaluated these theories using a cohort of young workers studied over 16 years. The study aim was to describe and evaluate patterns of hearing loss and asymmetry by gender, agricultural exposure and gunfire exposure. This was a secondary analysis of data collected from young adults during follow-up of a randomized controlled trial. This follow-up study evaluated long-term effects of a hearing conservation intervention for rural students. The sample consisted of 392 of 690 participants from the original trial. In total, 355 young adults (aged 29-33 years) completed baseline and follow-up noise exposure surveys and clinical audiometric examinations. Data are displayed graphically as thresholds by frequency and ear and degree of asymmetry between ears (left minus right). In the primary group comparisons, low and high frequency averages and mean high frequency asymmetry were analyzed using mixed linear models. At frequencies &gt;2000 Hz, men showed more hearing loss, with greater asymmetry and a different asymmetry pattern, than women. For men with documented hearing loss, there was a trend toward increasing asymmetry with increasing levels of hearing loss. Asymmetry at high frequencies varied substantially by level of shooting exposure. While &quot;head shadowing&quot; is accepted as the primary explanation for asymmetric hearing loss in the audiologic and related public health literature, our findings are more consistent with physiological differences as the primary cause of asymmetric hearing loss, with greater susceptibility to NIHL in the left ear of men.

"24708640","Using prophylactic antioxidants to prevent noise-induced hearing damage in young adults: a protocol for a double-blind, randomized controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: During leisure activities young people are often exposed to excessive noise levels resulting in an increase of noise-induced symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus and hyperacusis. Noise-induced tinnitus is often perceived after loud music exposure and provides an important marker for overexposure as a temporary threshold shift that is often not experienced by the individual itself. As oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of noise-induced hearing loss, the use of antioxidants to prevent hearing damage has recently become the subject of research.METHODS: This study proposes a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial to assess the effects of a prophylactic combination of N-acetylcysteine (600 mg) and magnesium (200 mg) prior to leisure noise exposure in young adults. The primary outcome measure is the tinnitus loudness scored by a visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary outcome measures are the differences in audiological measurements for the antioxidant treatments compared to placebo intake. Audiological testing comprising of pure tone audiometry including frequencies up to 16 kHz, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions and speech-in-noise testing will be performed prior to and within 7 hours after noise exposure. By use of a mixed effects statistical model, the effects of antioxidants compared to placebo intake will be assessed.DISCUSSION: As adolescents and young adults often do not use hearing protection while being exposed to loud music, the use of preventive antioxidant intake may provide a useful and harmless way to prevent noise-induced hearing damage in this population. Furthermore, when exposed to hazardous noise levels the protection provided by hearing protectors might not be sufficient to prevent hearing damage and antioxidants may provide additive otoprotective effects. Previous research mainly focused on occupational noise exposure. The present study provides a protocol to assess the usefulness of antioxidants during leisure noise activities.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The present protocol is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01727492."
"24700499","Do hearing protectors protect hearing?","BACKGROUND: We examined the association between self-reported hearing protection use at work and incidence of hearing shifts over a 5-year period.METHODS: Audiometric data from 19,911 workers were analyzed. Two hearing shift measures-OSHA standard threshold shift (OSTS) and high-frequency threshold shift (HFTS)-were used to identify incident shifts in hearing between workers' 2005 and 2009 audiograms. Adjusted odds ratios were generated using multivariable logistic regression with multi-level modeling.RESULTS: The odds ratio for hearing shift for workers who reported never versus always wearing hearing protection was nonsignificant for OSTS (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.92-1.64) and marginally significant for HFTS (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.00-1.59). A significant linear trend towards increased risk of HFTS with decreased use of hearing protection was observed (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02).CONCLUSION: The study raises concern about the effectiveness of hearing protection as a substitute for noise control to prevent noise-induced hearing loss in the workplace."

Subjects were divided into two groups for analysis. A subject was placed within the high risk group if he/she reported listening to music at near maximum volume and had a physical measurement of his/her preferred listening level recorded at &gt; 85 dBA. DPOAE and TEOAE levels were measured and compared between the two groups.STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 1928 students from a tertiary educational institution in Singapore.RESULTS: TEOAE levels were found to be significantly lower in the high risk group at 4 kHz. DPOAE levels were also found to be significantly depressed in the high risk group at 1, 2, 3, and 4 kHz with the largest mean difference at 4 kHz. A four-way ANOVA carried out for OAE amplitudes using gender, ear laterality, risk profile, and years of usage as independent factors also showed that risk profile was a significant factor in determining the OAE amplitude at 4 kHz.CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that both DPAOE and TEOAE values are diminished in the Asian subjects at high risk for noise exposure."

Prevalence and adjusted prevalence ratios for NSTS were estimated by industry. NSTS, OSTS, and OSTS-A prevalences were compared by industry.RESULTS: Twenty percent of workers had an NSTS, 14% had an OSTS, and 6% had an OSTS-A. For most industries, the OSTS and OSTS-A criteria identified 28% to 36% and 66% to 74% fewer workers than the NSTS criteria, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Use of NSTS criteria allowing for earlier detection of shifts in hearing is recommended for improved prevention of occupational hearing loss."

The noise exposure and hearing loss-related data were gathered during occupational noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) screening. The hospital data were used to identify all members of the study population who were admitted, and the reason for admission. Finally, access to the death-related data made it possible to identify participants who died during the course of the study. Cox proportional hazards model taking into account hearing status, noise levels, age and cumulative duration of noise exposure at the time of the hearing test established the risk of work-related injuries leading to admission to hospital.RESULTS: For each dB of hearing loss, a statistically significant risk increase was observed (HR=1.01 dB 95% CI 1.006 to 1.01). An association (HR=2.36 95% CI 2.01 to 2.77) was also found between working in an occupational ambient noise =100 dBA and the risk of injury.CONCLUSIONS: From a safety perspective, this issue is highly relevant; especially when workers are exposed to intense ambient noise and NIHL."

"24610168","Longitudinal changes in hearing threshold levels of noise-exposed construction workers.","PURPOSE: Longitudinal analysis of audiometric data of a large population of noise-exposed workers provides insight into the development of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) as a function of noise exposure and age, particularly during the first decade of noise exposure.METHODS: Data of pure-tone audiometry of 17,930 construction workers who underwent periodic occupational hearing screening at least twice during a 4-year period were available for analysis. These concerned all follow-up measurements of the baseline cohort described by Leensen et al. (Int Arch Occup Environ Health 84:577-590, 2011). Linear mixed models explored the relationship between the annual rate of change in hearing and noise exposure level, exposure duration, and age. Data of 3,111 workers who were tested on three occasions were used to investigate the pattern of hearing loss development.RESULTS: The mean annual deterioration in hearing in this study population was 0.54 dB/yr, and this became larger with increasing noise exposure level and increasing age. Remarkably, during the first decade of noise exposure, an improvement in hearing threshold levels (HTLs) was observed. The change in hearing over three measurements showed a concave development of hearing loss as a function of time, which corresponds to NIHL development.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, hearing deteriorated over the measurement period. Because HTLs at follow-up were better than those obtained at baseline, no statement can be made about the NIHL development during the first decade of noise exposure. This improvement in HTLs rather resembles the result of measurement variation in occupational screening audiometry than an actual improvement in hearing ability."
"24605524","[Hearing loss in noisy workplaces].","Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) from prolonged occupational exposure to noise continues was described. Since a therapy against NIHL is not currently available, it is important to take actions to minimize the exposure to noise. It is also important to perform auditory controls. In October 1992, the Ministry of Labour issued &quot;Guidelines for Preventing Noise Induced Disorders&quot; in Japan. The guidelines oblige employers who hire over fifty workers to take actions to prevent NIHL at the workplace that have the equivalent noise level of 85 dB (A) or higher. In fact there are lots of noise-induced disorders at the small workplace. It should be obliged to use this guideline in all workplaces."
"24603543","Hearing loss in relation to sound exposure of professional symphony orchestra musicians.","OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to: (1) estimate the hearing status of classical symphony orchestra musicians and (2) investigate the hypothesis that occupational sound exposure of symphony orchestra musicians leads to elevated hearing thresholds.DESIGN: The study population comprised all the musicians from five symphony orchestras. Questionnaires were filled in by 337 subjects, and 212 subjects performed an audiometric test. For a group of 182 musicians (363 ears) the results of the audiometry was analyzed in relation to the individual exposure, which was estimated on the basis of sound measurements and questionnaire data regarding the exposure time. The mean hearing threshold at the frequencies 3, 4, and 6 kHz, corrected for age and sex, was used as outcome.RESULTS: The musician ears with the highest exposure (29 of 363) had an additional threshold shift of 6.3 dB compared with the 238 ears with lowest exposure. The observed hearing loss of musicians was smaller compared with the noise-induced permanent threshold shift (NIPTS) predicted from ISO1999. A remaining confounding effect of age after ISO7029 age corrections could be observed to explain the difference in observed and predicted NIPTS. However, the observed hearing loss difference between the left and the right ear of musicians was 2.5 dB (95% confidence interval 1.5-3.6), which was similar to the NIPTS predicted from ISO1999. Most of the musicians had better hearing at 3, 4, and 6 kHz for age than expected, however, 29 ears with the highest exposure above 90.4 dBA with a mean exposure time of 41.7 years had significantly elevated hearing thresholds. Trumpet players and the left ear of first violinists had significantly elevated hearing thresholds compared with other musicians.CONCLUSION: Most of the symphony orchestra musicians had better hearing than expected but they had a work-related risk of developing additional noise-induced hearing loss. The additional NITPS of the left ear compared with the right ear was at the expected level based on the cumulated sound exposure and ISO1999, indicating that performing music may induce hearing loss to the same extent as industrial noise."

"24570315","The music listening preferences and habits of youths in Singapore and its relation to leisure noise-induced hearing loss.","INTRODUCTION: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a preventable condition, and much has been done to protect workers from it. However, thus far, little attention has been given to leisure NIHL. The purpose of this study is to determine the possible music listening preferences and habits among young people in Singapore that may put them at risk of developing leisure NIHL.METHODS: In our study, the proportion of participants exposed to &gt; 85 dBA for eight hours a day (time-weighted average) was calculated by taking into account the daily number of hours spent listening to music and by determining the average sound pressure level at which music was listened to.RESULTS: A total of 1,928 students were recruited from Temasek Polytechnic, Singapore. Of which, 16.4% of participants listened to portable music players with a time-weighted average of &gt; 85 dBA for 8 hours. On average, we found that male students were more likely to listen to music at louder volumes than female students (p &lt; 0.001). We also found that the Malay students in our study listened to louder music than the Chinese students (p &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSION: We found that up to one in six young persons in Singapore is at risk of developing leisure NIHL from music delivered via earphones. As additional risks due to exposure to leisure noise from other sources was not taken into account, the extent of the problem of leisure NIHL may be even greater.

The overall quality of studies was low to very low, as rated using the GRADE approach.RESULTS: One study of stricter legislation showed a favorable effect on noise levels. Three studies, of which two RCTs, did not find an effect of a HLPP. Four studies showed that better use of hearing protection devices in HLPPs decreased the risk of hearing loss. In four other studies, workers in a HLPP still had a 0.5 dB greater hearing loss at 4 kHz (95% CI - 0.5 to 1.7) than non-exposed workers. In two similar studies there was a substantial risk of hearing loss in spite of a HLPP.CONCLUSIONS: Stricter enforcement of legislation and better implementation of HLPPs can reduce noise levels in workplaces. Better evaluations of technical interventions and long-term effects are needed."
"24564696","Methods for evaluating temporal trends in noise exposure.","OBJECTIVE: Hearing conservation programs have been mandatory in many US industries since 1983. Since then, three program elements (audiometric testing, hearing protection, and training) have been the focus of much research. By comparison, little has been done on noise exposure evaluation.DESIGN: Temporal trends in time weighted average (TWA) exposures and the fraction of measurements exceeding 85 dBA were evaluated by facility, by exposure group within facility, and by individual worker within facility.STUDY SAMPLE: A large dataset (&gt; 10 000 measurements over 20 years) from eight facilities operated by a multinational aluminum manufacturing company was studied.RESULTS: Overall, exposures declined across locations over the study period. Several facilities demonstrated substantial reductions in exposure, and the results of mean noise levels and exceedance fractions generally showed good agreement. The results of analyses at the individual level diverged with analyses by facility and exposure group within facility, suggesting that individual-level analyses, while challenging, may provide important information not available from coarser levels of analysis.CONCLUSIONS: Validated metrics are needed to allow for assessment of temporal trends in noise exposure. Such metrics will improve our ability to characterize, in a standardized manner, efforts to reduce noise-induced hearing loss."
"24564694","Temporary threshold shift after impulse-noise during video game play: laboratory data.","OBJECTIVE: Prevention of temporary threshold shift (TTS) after laboratory-based exposure to pure-tones, broadband noise, and narrowband noise signals has been achieved, but prevention of TTS under these experimental conditions may not accurately reflect protection against hearing loss following impulse noise. This study used a controlled laboratory-based TTS paradigm that incorporated impulsive stimuli into the exposure protocol; development of this model could provide a novel platform for assessing proposed therapeutics.DESIGN: Participants played a video game that delivered gunfire-like sound through headphones as part of a target practice game. Effects were measured using audiometric threshold evaluations and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). The sound level and number of impulses presented were sequentially increased throughout the study.STUDY SAMPLE: Participants were normal-hearing students at the University of Florida who provided written informed consent prior to participation.RESULTS: TTS was not reliably induced by any of the exposure conditions assessed here. However, there was significant individual variability, and a subset of subjects showed TTS under some exposure conditions.CONCLUSIONS: A subset of participants demonstrated reliable threshold shifts under some conditions. Additional experiments are needed to better understand and optimize stimulus parameters that influence TTS after simulated impulse noise."
"24564693","Short-term variability of pure-tone thresholds obtained with TDH-39P earphones.","OBJECTIVE: To estimate the short-term variability and correlates of variability in pure-tone thresholds obtained using audiometric equipment designed for occupational use, and to examine the justification for excluding 8 kHz as a mandatory threshold in occupational hearing conservation programs.METHOD: Pure-tone thresholds and other hearing-related tests (e.g. noise dosimetry, otoscopy, middle-ear assessment) were conducted with a group of 527 adults between 20 and 69 years of age. Five measurement visits were completed by participants within 14 days.RESULTS: The 50% critical difference boundaries were - 5 and 0 dB at 4 kHz and below and - 5 and 5 dB at 6 and 8 kHz. The likelihood of spurious notches due to test-retest variability was substantially lower than the likelihood of failing to detect a notched configuration when present. Correlates of variability included stimulus frequency, baseline threshold, acoustic reflectance of the ear, average noise exposure during the previous eight hours, age, and the tester's level of education in audiology.CONCLUSION: The short-term variability in 8-kHz pure-tone thresholds obtained with the TDH-39P earphone was slightly greater than at other frequencies, but this difference was not large enough to justify the disadvantages stemming from the inability to detect a 6-kHz notch."
"24564692","Warfighter auditory situation awareness: effects of augmented hearing protection/enhancement devices and TCAPS for military ground combat applications.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of current hearing protection/enhancement devices (HPEDs) and tactical communications and protection systems (TCAPS) on auditory detection and identification of three critical military signals associated with potential &quot;threats.&quot;DESIGN: Utilizing a 6  3 within-subject experimental design, 24 normal-hearing Virginia Tech Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) cadets and active duty soldiers participated.STUDY SAMPLE: Five HPEDS and TCAP devices plus the open ear were tested. On each trial, either wearing a device or with open ears, subjects walked along a 3000-foot line of discrete distance markers toward the auditory threat, which was not visible but still within line-of-sight over flat terrain, stopping to listen when instructed. On approach to the threat, the linear distance at first detection was measured, followed by a continued approach until positive identification occurred. Then the subject reversed direction, retreating away from the threat until detection was lost.RESULTS: ANOVA and post hoc tests were applied to determine statistically-significant differences among HPEDs, TCAPS, and the open ear on the objective detection and identification distance measures.CONCLUSIONS: The results have serious implications for selection of HPDs, HPEDs, and TCAPS for applications where preservation of auditory situational awareness via the fundamental detection and identification tasks are essential."

"24549507","[Hearing research news: from the periphery to the center].","In the clinical setting, a patient's hearing level is usually quantified by determining the hearing threshold in pure tone and speech audiometry. The measurement and analysis of auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) for quantification of hearing impairment go beyond the scope of routine ENT diagnostic practice. In basic scientific studies, ABRs are commonly used to determine hearing thresholds in animal models. In the last few years, analysis of suprathreshold ABRs, particularly ABR wave I suprathreshold amplitudes, have led to the discovery and understanding of previously undetected hearing impairments in noise-induced and age-related hearing loss models. Deafferentation of inner hair cells and auditory nerve fiber degeneration were identified as pathophysiological correlates to the observed reduction in ABR wave I amplitudes. Such reductions in ABR wave 1 amplitudes could also be identified in chronic tinnitus patients with apparently normal hearing. Recent functional magnetic resonance tomography studies in humans have shown that the limbic system can influence the perception of tinnitus by interacting with an endogenous noise-cancelling system. This highlights the importance of psychotherapeutic treatment approaches for chronic tinnitus."
"24509531","Predicting hearing thresholds in occupational noise-induced hearing loss by auditory steady state responses.","OBJECTIVES: Currently available behavioral tools for the assessment of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) depend on the reliable cooperation of the subject. Furthermore, in workers' compensation cases, there is considerable financial gain to be had from exaggerating symptoms, such that accurate assessment of true hearing threshold levels is essential. An alternative objective physiologic tool for assessing NIHL is the auditory steady state response (ASSR) test, which combines frequency specificity with a high level of auditory stimulation, making it applicable for the evaluation of subjects with a moderate to severe deficit. The primary aim of the study was to assess the value of the multifrequency ASSR test in predicting the behavioral warble-tone audiogram in a large sample of young subjects with NIHL of varying severity or with normal hearing. The secondary goal was to assess suprathreshold ASSR growth functions in these two groups.DESIGN: The study group included 157 subjects regularly exposed to high levels of occupational noise, who attended a university-associated audiological clinic for evaluation of NIHL from 2009 through 2011. All underwent a behavioral audiogram, and on the basis of the findings, were divided into those with NIHL (108 subjects, 216 ears) or normal hearing (49 subjects, 98 ears). The accuracy of the ASSR threshold estimations for frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz was compared between groups, and the specificity and sensitivity of the ASSR test in differentiating ears with or without NIHL was calculated using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Linear regression analysis was used to formulate an equation to predict the behavioral warble-tone audiogram at each test frequency using ASSR thresholds. Multifrequency ASSR amplitude growth as a function of stimulus intensity was compared between the NIHL and normal-hearing groups for 1000 Hz and 4000 Hz carrier frequencies.RESULTS: In the subjects with NIHL, ASSR thresholds to various frequencies were significantly and highly correlated with the behavioral warble-tone thresholds; Pearson correlation coefficients ranged from 0.6 to 0.8 over the four frequencies tested. Differences between thresholds ranged from 10 to 13 dB. The configuration of the ASSR waveforms closely approximated the behavioral audiogram. The sensitivity for screening hearing thresholds was 92%; by frequency, sensitivity ranged between 92.7 and 98.4%, but specificity was lower, especially at the low frequencies. ASSR accurately predicted moderate and severe NIHL. The mean ASSR growth amplitude to increasing stimulus level for 1000 and 4000 Hz was significantly steeper in the NIHL than in the normal-hearing group, with no significant difference between frequencies.CONCLUSIONS: The ASSR test has a high sensitivity to detect moderate to severe hearing loss in subjects with NIHL. Its use can facilitate the early identification of noise-exposed workers with NIHL. It may also serve an important medico-legal function in cases of workers' compensation. The ASSR test is not, by itself, an appropriate tool for hearing screening in the general population."
"24449009","Free-field study on auditory localization and discrimination performance in older adults.","Localization accuracy and acuity for low- (0.375-0.75 kHz; LN) and high-frequency (2.25-4.5 kHz; HN) noise bands were examined in young (20-29 years) and older adults (65-83 years) in the acoustic free-field. A pointing task was applied to quantify accuracy, while acuity was inferred from minimum audible angle (MAA) thresholds measured with an adaptive 3-alternative forced-choice procedure. Accuracy decreased with laterality and age. From young to older adults, the accuracy declined by up to 23 % for the low-frequency noise band across all lateralities. The mean age effect was even more pronounced on MAA thresholds. Thus, age was a strong predictor for MAA thresholds for both LN and HN bands. There was no significant correlation between hearing status and localization performance. These results suggest that central auditory processing of space declines with age and is mainly driven by age-related changes in the processing of binaural cues (interaural time difference and interaural intensity difference) and not directly induced by peripheral hearing loss. We conclude that the representation of the location of sound sources becomes blurred with age as a consequence of declined temporal processing, the effect of which becomes particularly evident for MAA thresholds, where two closely adjoining sound sources have to be separated. While localization accuracy and MAA were not correlated in older adults, only a weak correlation was found in young adults. These results point to an employment of different processing strategies for localization accuracy and acuity."
"24408249","Auditory thresholds among military musicians: conventional and high frequency.","PURPOSE: To analyze and characterize tonal auditory thresholds between 500 Hz and 16,000 Hz of professional musicians, specifically members of a military band.METHODS: A historic cohort study was carried out comparing one group of 50 professional musicians (military band) with another group (44 subjects) without history of professional exposure to intense sound; the groups were homogenous (p&lt;0.05%) in relation to gender (male) and age (about 35 years old). Tone threshold audiometry for conventional (from 500 to 8,000 Hz) and high frequencies was applied (from 9,000 to 16,000 Hz).RESULTS: Exposure to music triggered permanent hearing impairment. As to conventional auditory thresholds, the exposed and non-exposed groups presented sensorineural hearing loss of 32 and 2.27%, respectively. The subjects exposed to music had 14.54 times more risks of acquiring sensorineural hearing loss than the non-exposed group. After 20 years of exposure to music, significant worsening was observed in auditory thresholds, especially at extended high frequencies, and differences occurred between the groups from the age of 30 on.CONCLUSION: Exposure to music caused permanent hearing impairment, showing differences in relation to the non-exposed group, registered in conventional audiometry and at high-frequency audiometry."
"25812386","The influence of jet engine noise on hearing of technical staff.","BACKGROUND: Due to high sound pressure levels (SPLs), noise produced by jet planes may be harmful to hearing of people working in their proximity. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of exposure to jet engine noise on technical staff hearing.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprised 60 men, aged 24-50 years, employed in army as technical staff and exposed to jet engine noise for 6-20 years. The control group were 50 non-noise exposed males, aged 25-51 years. Exposure to noise emitted by jet engines was evaluated. Pure-tone audiometry (PTA) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) were recorded in both groups.RESULTS: Jet engines emitted broadband noise with spectrum dominated by components in the frequency range 315-6300 Hz (1/3-octave bands). Maximum A-weighted SPL during tests reached values of approx. 120-130 dB. Consequently, engine-servicing personnel (even in the case of a single engine test) was exposed to noise (at A-weighted daily noise exposure level above 95 dB) exceeding permissible levels. Averaged audiometric hearing threshold levels of technical staff were higher (= 17 dB HL, p &lt; 0.001) than in the control group. Similarly, the DPOAE amplitude was lower (= 17 dB SPL, p &lt; 0.01) in the noise-exposed subjects compared to the non-exposed ones. Significant reduction of DPOAE levels was mainly noted for high frequencies (3-6 kHz).CONCLUSIONS: Despite the usage of hearing protection devices, both PTA and DPOAE consistently showed poorer hearing in engine-servicing personnel vs. control group."
"26706709","Large-scale phenotyping of noise-induced hearing loss in 100 strains of mice.","A cornerstone technique in the study of hearing is the Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR), an electrophysiologic technique that can be used as a quantitative measure of hearing function. Previous studies have published databases of baseline ABR thresholds for mouse strains, providing a valuable resource for the study of baseline hearing function and genetic mapping of hearing traits in mice. In this study, we further expand upon the existing literature by characterizing the baseline ABR characteristics of 100 inbred mouse strains, 47 of which are newly characterized for hearing function. We identify several distinct patterns of baseline hearing deficits and provide potential avenues for further investigation. Additionally, we characterize the sensitivity of the same 100 strains to noise exposure using permanent thresholds shifts, identifying several distinct patterns of noise-sensitivity. The resulting data provides a new resource for studying hearing loss and noise-sensitivity in mice. "
"26700251","Arsenic related hearing loss in miners.","PURPOSE: Arsenic is a toxic metalloid that carries number of potential risks to human health, although there is little evidence of the ototoxic effect of arsenic. The aim of this study was to identify the relationship between arsenic exposure and hearing loss by measuring blood arsenic concentrations and hearing among miners.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This research is a retrospective case control study. Included in the study were miners employed in a single silver mine whose blood arsenic concentrations were high. A comparison was made on the pure tone audiometry measurements taken from miners exposed only to arsenic (Group 1), those exposed to both arsenic and noise (Group 2) and a control group exposed to neither arsenic nor noise (Group 3).RESULTS: It was found that for both ears at all frequencies, the hearing level of Group 3 was better than the hearing levels of both Group 1 and Group 2. There was no correlation between the blood arsenic levels and hearing levels in both ears.CONCLUSION: This study has revealed the ototoxic effects of arsenic. As blood arsenic concentrations do not reflect long-term exposure, no correlation was identified between blood arsenic concentrations and hearing levels. Further studies will be needed to clarify the mechanisms involved in the effect of arsenic on hearing. This paper represents the largest study to date focusing on the isolated effects of arsenic on hearing through the use of a clinical auditory test."

The following procedures were performed: occupational history, objective and subjective assessment of hearing protectors. Only subjects in the experimental group received training and guidance on proper hearing protector insertion.RESULTS: Attenuation values were significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group at all frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz) investigated through the objective (MIRE) and subjective (REAT) methods. In addition, attenuation values in the control group were lower than those provided by the hearing protector manufacturer.CONCLUSION: Both objective and subjective attenuation tests demonstrated the efficacy of training on insertion of hearing protectors because the group that received training on proper hearing protection insertion exhibited higher attenuation values than the untrained group."

"26572701","Hearing loss and tinnitus in rock musicians: A Norwegian survey.","Our focus in this study was to assess hearing thresholds and the prevalence and characteristics of tinnitus in a large group of rock musicians based in Norway. A further objective was to assess related factors such as exposure, instrument category, and the preventive effect of hearing protection. The study was a cross-sectional survey of rock musicians selected at random from a defined cohort of musicians. A random control group was included for comparison. We recruited 111 active musicians from the Oslo region, and a control group of 40 nonmusicians from the student population at the University of Troms. The subjects were investigated using clinical examination, pure tone audiometry, tympanometry, and a questionnaire. We observed a hearing loss in 37.8% of the rock musicians. Significantly poorer hearing thresholds were seen at most pure-tone frequencies in musicians than controls, with the most pronounced threshold shift at 6 kHz. The use of hearing protection, in particular custom-fitted earplugs, has a preventive effect but a minority of rock musicians apply them consistently. The degree of musical performance exposure was inversely related to the degree of hearing loss in our sample. Bass and guitar players had higher hearing thresholds than vocalists. We observed a 20% prevalence of chronic tinnitus but none of the affected musicians had severe tinnitus symptomatology. There was no statistical association between permanent tinnitus and hearing loss in our sample. We observed an increased prevalence of hearing loss and tinnitus in our sample of Norwegian rock musicians but the causal relationship between musical exposure and hearing loss or tinnitus is ambiguous. We recommend the use of hearing protection in rock musicians. "

Individual pure tone audiometry thresholds were compared with distortion product otoacoustic emission amplitudes, and a correlation of these measurements was conducted.RESULTS: Pure tone audiometry threshold elevation was identified in 13 out of 16 workers. When distortion product otoacoustic emission amplitudes were compared with pure tone audiometry thresholds at matched frequencies, no evidence of a robust relationship was apparent. Seven out of 16 workers had substantial distortion product otoacoustic emissions with elevated pure tone audiometry thresholds.CONCLUSION: No clinically relevant predictive relationship between distortion product otoacoustic emission amplitude and pure tone audiometry threshold was apparent. These results do not support the replacement of pure tone audiometry with distortion product otoacoustic emissions in screening. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions at frequencies associated with elevated pure tone audiometry thresholds are evidence of intact outer hair cell function, suggesting that sites distinct from these contribute to auditory deficit following ototrauma."
"26536965","Exposure to excessive sounds during orchestra rehearsals and temporary hearing changes in hearing among musicians.","BACKGROUND: It has been shown that musicians are at risk of noise-induced hearing loss. The aim of the study has been to evaluate the temporary changes of hearing in the case of orchestral musicians after group rehearsals.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group comprised 18 orchestral musicians, aged 30-58 years old (mean: 40 years old) having 12-40 years (mean: 22 years) of professional experience. The temporary changes in hearing after group rehearsals were determined using transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs). Noise exposures during group rehearsals were also evaluated.RESULTS: Musicians' hearing threshold levels were higher (worse) than expected for the equivalent non-noise-exposed population. Moreover, the high frequency notched audiograms were observed in some of them. After rehearsals, during which musicians were exposed to orchestral noise at A-weighted equivalent-continuous sound pressure level (normalized to 8-h working day) varied from 75.6-83.1 dB (mean: 79.4 dB). The significant post-exposure reductions of TEOAE amplitudes (approx. 0.7 dB) both for the total response and frequency bands of 2000 and 3000 Hz were noted. However, there were no significant differences between pre- and postexposure reproducibility of TEOAE.CONCLUSIONS: Obtained results have confirmed that orchestral musicians are at risk of hearing loss due to their professional activities, even at exposures to orchestral noise less than the limit values for occupational noise.Wykazano, ze muzycy narazeni sa na ryzyko utraty sluchu wywolanej halasem.

Of the 1388 workers, 266 met the inclusion criteria for this study. Each subject underwent a physical examination and an otologic examination and completed a health-related questionnaire. <U+03C7> and t tests were used to examine the differences between the asymmetric and symmetric hearing loss groups.RESULTS: One hundred thirty-one subjects (49.2%) had a binaural hearing threshold difference of 15 dB or more for at least one frequency, and there was no statistically significant difference between the left and right ears. The asymmetric hearing loss group was not exposed to higher cumulative noise levels (t = 0.522, p = 0.602), and there was no dose-response relation between asymmetry and cumulative noise levels (<U+03C7> = 6.502, p = 0.165). Men were 1.849 times more likely to have asymmetry than women were (95% confidence interval, 1.051 to 3.253). Among the workers with higher high-frequency hearing thresholds, audiometric asymmetry was 1.024 times more prevalent than that among those with lower high-frequency hearing thresholds (95% confidence interval, 1.004 to 1.044).CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that occupational noise exposure contributed minimally to asymmetry, whereas sex and binaural average thresholds significantly affected audiometric asymmetry. There was no evidence that the left ears were worse than the right ears."

"26487294","Gender and other factors associated with the use of hearing protection devices at work.","OBJECTIVE: To analyze whether sociodemographic, occupational, and health-related data are associated with the use of hearing protection devices at work, according to gender.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2006, using a random sample of 2,429 workers, aged between 18 and 65 years old, from residential sub-areas in Salvador, BA, Northeastern Brazil. Questionnaires were used to obtain sociodemographic, occupational, and health-related data. Workers who reported that they worked in places where they needed to shout in order to be heard were considered to be exposed to noise. Exposed workers were asked whether they used hearing protection devices, and if so, how frequently. Analyses were conducted according to gender, with estimates made about prevalence of the use of hearing protection devices, prevalence ratios, and their respective 95% confidence intervals.RESULTS: Twelve percent (12.3%) of study subjects reported that they were exposed to noise while working. Prevalence of the use of hearing protection devices was 59.3% for men and 21.4% for women. Men from higher socioeconomic levels (PR = 1.47; 95%CI 1.14;1.90) and who had previous audiometric tests (PR = 1.47; 95%CI 1.15;1.88) were more likely to use hearing protection devices. For women, greater perceived safety was associated with the use of protection devices (PR = 2.92; 95%CI 1.34;6.34). This perception was specifically related to the presence of supervisors committed to safety (PR = 2.09; 95%CI 1.04;4.21), the existence of clear rules to prevent workplace injuries (PR = 2.81; 95%CI 1.41;5.59), and whether they were informed about workplace safety (PR = 2.42; 95%CI 1.23;4.76).CONCLUSIONS: There is a gender bias regarding the use of hearing protection devices that is less favorable to women. The use of such devices among women is positively influenced by their perception of a safe workplace, suggesting that gender should be considered as a factor in hearing conservation programs."

Annual hearing shift rates were calculated based on the number of employees tested per year. Hearing conservation initiatives undertaken during the study period are described. An assessment of similar exposure group noise exposures was also undertaken to determine the magnitude of noise exposure reduction during the study period.RESULTS: Across all operations, hearing shift rates declined from 5.5% per year in 2006 to 1.3% per year in 2013 (P &lt; 0.001). The decline in shift rates was greater in mines and refineries, where baseline shift rates were higher, than in smelter workers. Modest reductions in noise exposure occurred during the study period.CONCLUSIONS: We observed a substantial decline in hearing shift rates during the study period. We describe the hearing conservation initiatives that were collectively associated with this decline. We suspect these initiatives could be deployed relatively easily and at modest cost in other industries with noise-exposed employees."
"26443047","Is this STS work-related? ISO 1999 predictions as an adjunct to clinical judgment.","BACKGROUND: Physicians and audiologists are often asked to decide whether standard threshold shifts (STSs) are work-related; epidemiological data can inform these decisions.METHODS: Predictions of ISO (2013) for both age-related and noise-induced threshold shifts, for the 2, 3, and 4 kHz average used in calculating OSHA STSs, are presented, in tables, graphs, and an Excel spreadsheet calculator. Specifically, the ISO 1999 model estimates age-related thresholds based on age and sex; it estimates noise-induced threshold shifts based on noise level and duration. It specifies that to estimate the final hearing thresholds for a person of given percentile, age, sex, and noise exposure, the expected age-related threshold is to be added to the expected noise-induced threshold shift. Examples show how these data can predict the relative contributions of aging and occupational noise to an STS.RESULTS: Early-career STSs, especially with high levels of noise exposure, are more likely to be primarily noise-induced. After the first decade of exposure, most STSs will be primarily age-related.CONCLUSION: Given a worker's age, sex, and occupational noise exposure history, ISO 1999 estimates of the expected contributions of aging and noise can supplement clinical judgment."
"26398252","Perception of hearing protectors by workers that participate in hearing preservation programs: a preliminary study.","PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare the workers' perception of comfort and use aspects regarding two types of hearing protectors (shell and earplug), in three units from a lumbering company, with different implantation times for Hearing Preservation Programs.METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study comparing 440 workers' perception of hearing protectors, from three companies in Paran State (Brazil), with different times for Hearing Preservation Programs. Two closed questionnaires were applied (9 and 10 questions, respectively), with a scale of answers varying from 1 to 5 (Likert's scale) regarding the perception of the comfort of hearing protectors. Then, audiometry results were analyzed.RESULTS: About 17.5% presented audiogram examinations with alterations. With regard to the questionnaire about the comfort perception, the importance of noise attenuation (mean of 4.25) was the most relevant aspect, followed by communication possibility (mean of 4.15). In the protector assessment, Unit A with more Hearing Preservation Program time presented better scores for both the worker's perception of important aspects regarding hearing protector and for the assessment of the used hearing protector. There was a significant difference on communication difficulty with the use of a hearing protector among workers with normal and altered audiograms (p=0.0371). With regard to the global comfort in the comparison of workers using the shell-type hearing protector with those using insert-type hearing protectors, there was no difference (p=0.2264), irrespective of the type of the unit.CONCLUSION: In general, the unit workers presented a good perception of the important aspects about the hearing protection use of both types of hearing protectors."
"26380997","Hearing Risk among Young Personal Listening Device Users: Effects at High-Frequency and Extended High-Frequency Audiogram Thresholds.","OBJECTIVE: The usage of personal listening devices (PLDs) is associated with risks of hearing loss. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of music exposure from these devices on high-frequency hearing thresholds of PLD users.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 282 young adults were questioned regarding their listening habits and symptoms associated with PLD listening. Their audiogram thresholds were determined at high (3-8 kHz) frequencies and extended high frequencies (EHFs, 9-16 kHz). The preferred listening volumes of PLD users were used to compute their overall 8-h equivalent music exposure levels (LAeq8h).RESULTS: Approximately 80% of the subjects were regular PLD users. Of these, 20.1% had LAeq8h of =75 dBA, while 4.4% of them had LAeq8h of =85 dBA, which carries a high risk of hearing damage. Compared with those exposed to LAeq8h of &lt;75 dBA, subjects who had LAeq8h of =75 dBA reported a significantly higher incidence of tinnitus and difficulty in hearing others immediately after using PLDs. PLD users who were exposed to LAeq8h of =75 dBA and had been using their devices for =4 years also showed significantly higher mean audiogram thresholds compared with non-users at most EHFs tested. In addition, the thresholds of PLD users at EHFs showed a weak but significant positive correlation with their LAeq8h.CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest that excessive exposure to music among PLD users may lead to initial effects on their hearing at very high frequencies."
"26374778","Exposure to loud noise, bilateral high-frequency hearing loss and coronary heart disease.","OBJECTIVES: Bilateral high-frequency hearing loss is an indicator for chronic exposure to loud noise. This study aimed to examine the association between bilateral high-frequency hearing loss and the presence of coronary heart disease (CHD).METHODS: This study included 5223 participants aged 20-69 years who participated in the audiometry examination of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004. Bilateral high-frequency hearing loss was defined as the average high-frequency (3, 4 and 6 kHz) hearing threshold =25 dB in both ears. CHD was defined as self-reported diagnoses by doctors or other health professionals.RESULTS: Compared with those with normal high-frequency hearing, participants with bilateral high-frequency hearing loss were more likely to have CHD (OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.28 to 2.85) after adjustment for various covariates. This association was particularly strong for currently employed workers who were exposed to loud occupational noise (OR 4.23; 95% CI 1.32 to 13.55). For this subgroup, there was no significant association of CHD with unilateral high-frequency hearing loss, and unilateral or bilateral low-frequency hearing loss. Furthermore, there was no significant association of CHD with any types of hearing loss for participants who were not exposed to loud noise. Stratified analyses for participants exposed to loud noise showed that the observed association was particularly strong for those who were less than 50 years of age, less educated and current smokers.CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of an objective indicator for personal chronic exposure to loud noise, this study confirmed that exposure to loud occupational noise is associated with the presence of CHD."
"26356380","Measurement of impulse peak insertion loss from two acoustic test fixtures and four hearing protector conditions with an acoustic shock tube.","Impulse peak insertion loss (IPIL) was studied with two acoustic test fixtures and four hearing protector conditions at the E-A-RCAL Laboratory. IPIL is the difference between the maximum estimated pressure for the open-ear condition and the maximum pressure measured when a hearing protector is placed on an acoustic test fixture (ATF). Two models of an ATF manufactured by the French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis (ISL) were evaluated with high-level acoustic impulses created by an acoustic shock tube at levels of 134 decibels (dB), 150 dB, and 168 dB. The fixtures were identical except that the E-A-RCAL ISL fixture had ear canals that were 3 mm longer than the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) ISL fixture. Four hearing protection conditions were tested: Combat Arms earplug with the valve open, ETYPlugs  earplug, TacticalPro headset, and a dual-protector ETYPlugs earplug with TacticalPro earmuff. The IPILs measured for the E-A-RCAL fixture were 1.4 dB greater than the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) ISL ATF. For the E-A-RCAL ISL ATF, the left ear IPIL was 2.0 dB greater than the right ear IPIL. For the NIOSH ATF, the right ear IPIL was 0.3 dB greater than the left ear IPIL. "
"26356377","Predictive factors of occupational noise-induced hearing loss in Spanish workers: A prospective study.","The purpose of our study was to identify the main factors associated with objective noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), as indicated by abnormal audiometric testing, in Spanish workers exposed to occupational noise in the construction industry. We carried out a prospective study in Tenerife, Spain, using 150 employees exposed to occupational noise and 150 age-matched controls who were not working in noisy environments. The variables analyzed included sociodemographic data, noise-related factors, types of hearing protection, self-report hearing loss, and auditory-related symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, vertigo). Workers with pathological audiograms had significantly longer noise-exposure duration (16.2  11.4 years) relative to those with normal audiograms (10.2  7.0 years; t = 3.99, P &lt; 0.001). The vast majority of those who never used hearing protection measures had audiometric abnormalities (94.1%). Additionally, workers using at least one of the protection devices (earplugs or earmuffs) had significantly more audiometric abnormalities than those using both protection measures simultaneously (Chi square = 16.07; P &lt; 0.001). The logistic regression analysis indicates that the use of hearing protection measures [odds ratio (OR) = 12.30, confidence interval (CI) = 4.36-13.81, P &lt; 0.001], and noise-exposure duration (OR = 1.35, CI = 1.08-1.99, P = 0.040) are significant predictors of NIHL. This regression model correctly predicted 78.2% of individuals with pathological audiograms. The combined use of hearing protection measures, in particular earplugs and earmuffs, associates with a lower rate of audiometric abnormalities in subjects with high occupational noise exposure. The use of hearing protection measures at work and noise-exposure duration are best predictive factors of NIHL. Auditory-related symptoms and self-report hearing loss do not represent good indicators of objective NIHL. Routine monitoring of noise levels and hearing status are of great importance as part of effective hearing conservation programs. "
"26356367","The effects of a hearing education program on recreational noise exposure, attitudes and beliefs toward noise, hearing loss, and hearing protector devices in young adults.","Excessive recreational noise exposure in young adults might result in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and tinnitus. Inducing behavioral change in young adults is one of the aims of a hearing conservation program (HCP). The goal of the current study was to evaluate the effect of a hearing education program after 6 months in young adults in relation to knowledge regarding their individual hearing status. The results of a questionnaire regarding the weekly equivalent recreational noise exposure, attitudes and beliefs toward noise, and hearing loss and hearing protector devices (HPDs) were compared between both sessions. Seventy-eight young adults completed the questionnaire concerning recreational noise exposure, youth attitude to noise scale (YANS), and beliefs about hearing protection and hearing loss (BAHPHL). Their hearing status was evaluated based on admittance measures, audiometry, transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs), and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). The main analysis consisted of a mixed model analysis of variance with dependent variables of either the noise exposure or the scores on (subscales of) YANS and BAHPHL. The independent variables were hearing status and session one versus session two. There was a significant decrease in recreational noise exposure and several (sub) scales of YANS and BAHPHL between both the sessions. This behavioral change resulted in a more frequent use of HPDs in 12% of the participants. However, the behavioral change was not completely related to the knowledge of young adults' individual hearing status. To prevent hearing damage in young people, investing in HCPs is necessary, apart from regulating sound levels and its compliance at various leisure-time activities. Also, the long-term effect of HCPs and their most cost-efficient repetition rates should be further investigated. "

Part II: The effects of recreational noise exposure.","Great concern arises from recreational noise exposure, which might lead to noise-induced hearing loss in young adults. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effects of recreational noise exposure on hearing function in young adults. A questionnaire concerning recreational noise exposures and an audiological test battery were completed by 163 subjects (aged 18-30 years). Based on the duration of exposure and self-estimated loudness of various leisure-time activities, the weekly and lifetime equivalent noise exposure were calculated. Subjects were categorized in groups with low, intermediate, and high recreational noise exposure based on these values. Hearing was evaluated using audiometry, transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs), and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). Mean differences in hearing between groups with low, intermediate, and high recreational noise exposure were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). There were no significant differences in hearing thresholds, TEOAE amplitudes, and DPOAE amplitudes between groups with low, intermediate, or high recreational noise exposure. Nevertheless, one-third of our subjects exceeded the weekly equivalent noise exposure for all activities of 75 dBA. Further, the highest equivalent sound pressure levels (SPLs) were calculated for the activities visiting nightclubs or pubs, attending concerts or festivals, and playing in a band or orchestra. Moreover, temporary tinnitus after recreational noise exposure was found in 86% of our subjects. There were no significant differences in hearing between groups with low, intermediate, and high recreational noise exposure. Nevertheless, a long-term assessment of young adults' hearing in relation to recreational noise exposure is needed. "
"26356365","Hearing in young adults. Part I: The effects of attitudes and beliefs toward noise, hearing loss, and hearing protector devices.","There is great concern regarding the development of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in youth caused by high sound levels during various leisure activities. Health-orientated behavior of young adults might be linked to the beliefs and attitudes toward noise, hearing loss, and hearing protector devices (HPDs). The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effects of attitudes and beliefs toward noise, hearing loss, and HPDs on young adults' hearing status. A questionnaire and an audiological test battery were completed by 163 subjects (aged 18-30 years). The questionnaire contained the Youth Attitude to Noise Scale (YANS) and Beliefs about Hearing Protection and Hearing Loss (BAHPHL). A more positive attitude or belief represented an attitude where noise or hearing loss is seen as unproblematic and attitudes and beliefs regarding HPDs is worse. Hearing was evaluated using (high frequency) pure tone audiometry (PTA), transient evoked and distortion product otoacoustic emissions. First, mean differences in hearing between the groups with different attitudes and beliefs were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Second, a <U+03C7> test was used to examine the usage of HPDs by the different groups with different attitudes and beliefs. Young adults with a positive attitude had significantly more deteriorated hearing and used HPDs less than the other subjects. Hearing conservation programs (HCPs) for young adults should provide information and knowledge regarding noise, hearing loss, and HPDs. Barriers wearing HPDs should especially be discussed. Further, those campaigns should focus on self-experienced hearing related symptoms that might serve as triggers for attitudinal and behavioral changes."

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of exposure conditions on the risk of hearing loss using the Cox model. Seventy workers, employed in a press workshop, were selected to study their hearing threshold using an audiometric test. Their noise exposure histories also were analyzed. The results of the Cox model showed that the job type, smoking and the use of protection devices were effective to induce hearing loss. The relative risk of hearing loss in smokers was 1.1 times of non-smokers The relative risk of hearing loss in workers with the intermittent use of protection devices was 3.3 times those who used these devices continuously. The Cox model could analyze the effect of exposure conditions on hearing loss and provides useful information for managers in order to improve hearing conservation programs. "
"26276949","A Preliminary Analysis of Noise Exposure and Medical Outcomes for Department of Defense Military Musicians.","Noise exposure is a known occupational health hazard to those serving in the military. Previous military epidemiology studies have identified military occupations at risk of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL); however, musicians have not been specifically mentioned. The focus of military NIHL studies is usually on those service members of the combat arms occupations. This project was a preliminary examination of Department of Defense (DoD) active duty military musicians in regard to their noise exposure, annual hearing test rates, and hearing injury rates using available data sources. The analysis concluded that DoD military musicians are an underserved population in terms of hearing conservation efforts. Noise surveillance data extracted from the Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System-Industrial Hygiene showed that every musician similar exposure group (SEG) with noise survey data from 2009 to 2013 exceeded the occupation exposure level adopted by DoD Instruction 6055.12. However, only a small percentage of all DoD active duty military musicians (5.5% in the peak year of 2012) were assigned to a SEG that was actually surveyed. Hearing test data based on Current Procedural Terminology coding extracted from the Military Health System revealed that the percentage of musicians with annual hearing tests increased over the 5 years studied in all services except the Air Force. During 2013, the data showed that the Navy had the highest percentage of musicians with annual hearing tests at 70.9%, and the Air Force had the lowest at 11.4%. The Air Force had the highest percentage of hearing injuries of those musicians with annual hearing tests for all 5 years analyzed. Although noise surveillance and annual hearing tests are being conducted, they occur at a much lower rate than required for a population that is known to be overexposed to noise. "
"26169804","Age correction in monitoring audiometry: method to update OSHA age-correction tables to include older workers.","OBJECTIVES: The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Noise Standard provides the option for employers to apply age corrections to employee audiograms to consider the contribution of ageing when determining whether a standard threshold shift has occurred. Current OSHA age-correction tables are based on 40-year-old data, with small samples and an upper age limit of 60 years. By comparison, recent data (1999-2006) show that hearing thresholds in the US population have improved. Because hearing thresholds have improved, and because older people are increasingly represented in noisy occupations, the OSHA tables no longer represent the current US workforce. This paper presents 2 options for updating the age-correction tables and extending values to age 75 years using recent population-based hearing survey data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Both options provide scientifically derived age-correction values that can be easily adopted by OSHA to expand their regulatory guidance to include older workers.METHODS: Regression analysis was used to derive new age-correction values using audiometric data from the 1999-2006 US NHANES. Using the NHANES median, better-ear thresholds fit to simple polynomial equations, new age-correction values were generated for both men and women for ages 20-75 years.RESULTS: The new age-correction values are presented as 2 options. The preferred option is to replace the current OSHA tables with the values derived from the NHANES median better-ear thresholds for ages 20-75 years. The alternative option is to retain the current OSHA age-correction values up to age 60 years and use the NHANES-based values for ages 61-75 years.CONCLUSIONS: Recent NHANES data offer a simple solution to the need for updated, population-based, age-correction tables for OSHA. The options presented here provide scientifically valid and relevant age-correction values which can be easily adopted by OSHA to expand their regulatory guidance to include older workers."

Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is the most common disorder related to noise exposure. Smoking is probably associated with hearing loss. The simultaneous effect of noise and smoking on hearing is a recent concern. In this study, we assessed the simultaneous effect of noise and smoking on standard pure tone audiometry (PTA) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DP-OAEs). This was an historical cohort study on 224 workers exposed to noise who were divided into two groups: Smokers and nonsmokers. DP-OAE response amplitudes were assessed. Data were analyzed by SPSS software (version 19) using Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U test. One hundred and five subjects were smokers (case group) and 119 individuals were nonsmokers (control group). All the subjects were exposed to 91.08 + 2.29 dBA [time-weighted average (TWA) for an 8 h work shift]. Mean DP-OAE response amplitude at frequencies higher than 1,000 Hz was significantly higher in the smokers than the nonsmokers. This study showed that smoking can aggravate the effect of noise on hearing in DP-OAEs."

However, the hearing threshold recovery time after this trauma was uncertain. The present study aimed to assess this time. In this prospective survival analysis study, 28 consecutive patients with chronic otitis media who were undergoing tympanomastoidectomy were assessed. Standard pure-tone audiometry (PTA) and distortion-product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) were measured in all contralateral ears before and 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h after the surgery. Based on the PTA postoperative hearing loss, survival rates at frequencies of 3000 Hz, 4000 Hz, 6000 Hz, and 8000 Hz were 44.4%, 36.4%, 51.7%, and 47.4%, 24 h after surgery; 11.1%, 9.1%, 10.3%, and 13.2%, 48 h after surgery; and 0%, 0%, 3.4%, and 2.6%, 72 h after surgery, respectively. Based on the PTA and DPOAE, survival rates at all frequencies were 0%, 96 h after the surgery. According to the PTA, mean hearing recovery times were 61.98  26.76 h (3000 Hz), 62.73  26.50 h (4000 Hz), 67.08  25.90 h (6000 Hz), 70.70  24.13 h (8000 Hz), and with regard to DPOAE the recovery times were 58.58  28.39 h (2000 Hz), 63.32  28.83 h (4000 Hz), 65.22  29.13 h (6000 Hz), and 75.14  22.70 h (8000 Hz), respectively.

"26163676","Hearing Aid-Induced Plasticity in the Auditory System of Older Adults: Evidence From Speech Perception.","PURPOSE: We tested whether using hearing aids can improve unaided performance in speech perception tasks in older adults with hearing impairment.METHOD: Unaided performance was evaluated in dichotic listening and speech-in-noise tests in 47 older adults with hearing impairment; 36 participants in 3 study groups were tested before hearing aid fitting and after 4, 8, and 14 weeks of hearing-aid use. The remaining 11 participants served as a control group and were similarly evaluated but were not fitted with hearing aids. Three protocols were compared in the study groups: amplification for the nondominant ear, amplification for the dominant ear, and bilateral amplification. Subsequently, after 4 weeks, all participants were afforded bilateral amplification.RESULTS: In the study groups, unaided dichotic listening scores improved significantly in the nondominant ear by 8 weeks and onward. Significant improvements were also observed for unaided speech identification in noise, with some gains apparent after 4 weeks of hearing-aid use. No gains were observed in the control group.CONCLUSIONS: Using hearing aids for a relatively short period can induce changes in the way older adults process auditory inputs in perceptual tasks such as speech identification in noise and dichotic listening. These changes suggest that the central auditory system of older adults retains the potential for behaviorally relevant plasticity."

Noise-induced hearing loss is a significant impairment in the military and can affect combat performance. Military personnel are constantly exposed to high levels of noise and it is not surprising that noise induced hearing loss and tinnitus remain the second most prevalent service-connected disabilities. Much of the noise experienced by military personnel exceeds that of maximum protection achievable with double hearing protection. Unfortunately, unlike civilian personnel, military personnel have little option but to remain in noisy environments in order to complete specific tasks and missions. Use of hearing protection devices and follow-up audiological tests have become the mainstay of prevention of noise-induced hearing loss. This review focuses on sources of noise within the military, pathophysiology and management of patients with noise induced hearing loss. "

More and more evidences suggested that Catalase (CAT) gene polymorphism plays an important role in the development of NIHL. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of CAT gene polymorphisms with NIHL in a case-control study.DESIGN: A total of 719 unrelated adult Chinese Han population, including 225 healthy volunteers and 494 noise-exposed workers were recruited in this study. Six tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) were genotyped using an improved multiplex ligation detection reaction technique. Subsequently, the interaction between noise exposure level and genotypes and their effect on NIHL were analyzed using logistic regression.RESULTS: Among six tSNPs, two of them (rs208679 and rs769217) were significantly associated with noise exposure level. For rs208679 recessive effect, GG genotype had a significantly increased of NIHL risk in the exposure level of &lt;85 dB; and for rs769217 dominant effect, the combined genotypes TT/TC had a significantly increased of NIHL risk in the exposure level of 85 dB~92 dB; and the haplotype A-G-T-C-A-C had a risk effect on the NIHL in the exposure level of 85 dB~92 dB. In addition, the rs769217 polymorphism could enhance the transcription activities of the CAT gene.CONCLUSIONS: This study identified CAT is a NIHL susceptibility gene when noise exposure levels are taken into account. Rs208679 and rs769217 polymorphisms might be used as relevant risk estimates for the development of NIHL in population with different noise exposure levels."

This study aimed to investigate the occupational hearing loss among Chinese MSWL workers.METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 247 workers from 4 Chinese MSWLs was conducted. Noise and total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) levels at worksites were determined. We conducted hearing examinations to determine hearing thresholds. A worker was identified as having hearing loss if the mean threshold at 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hz in either ear was equal to or greater than 25 dB. Prevalence of occupational hearing loss was then evaluated. Using unconditional Logistic regression models, we estimated the odds ratios (ORs) of MSWL work associated with hearing loss.RESULTS: According to the job title for each worker, the study subjects were divided into 3 groups, including group 1 of 63 workers without MSWL occupational hazards exposure (control group), group 2 of 84 workers with a few or short-period MSWL occupational hazards exposure, and group 3 of 100 workers with continuous MSWL occupational hazards exposure. Both noise and TVOCs levels were significantly higher at worksites for group 3. Significantly poorer hearing thresholds at frequencies of 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hz were found in group 3, compared with that in group 1 and group 2. The overall prevalence rate of hearing loss was 23.5%, with the highest in group 3 (36.0%). The OR of MSWL work associated with hearing loss was 3.39 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28-8.96).CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest significantly higher prevalence of hearing loss among MSWL workers. Further studies are needed to explore possible exposure-response relationship between MSWL occupational hazards exposure and hearing loss."

In order to better understand the relationship between these methods, this article presents various factors relating attenuation values obtained with these methods through a series of tests. Experiments on human subjects were carried out where the subjects were instrumented on both ears with miniature microphones outside and underneath the protector. The subjects were then asked to go through a series of hearing threshold measurements (psychoacoustical method) followed by microphone sound recordings using high-level diffuse field broadband noises (physical method). The proposed test protocol allowed obtaining various factors relating the test methods as well as attenuation values and ratings for different protection conditions (open ear, earmuffs, earplugs, and dual protection). Results are presented for three models of passive earmuffs, three models of earplugs and all their combinations as dual hearing protectors. The validity and the relative importance of various terms used to correct the physical attenuation values when comparing with psychoacoustical attenuation values are examined. "

Objective To analyze the noise exposure in the Brazilian forestry industry workers and the effects on hearing. Methods The study sample comprised 109 employees of a company that specialized in reforestation. Their participants' mean age was 35.5 years (21 to 54 years), mean tenure at the company was 3.9 years (1 to 13 years), and mean total duration of noise exposure was 12.3 years (1 to 30 years). The existing documentation reporting on the jobs risk analysis was examined, noise level was measured, and pure tone audiometry was performed in all participants. Participants were divided into three groups according to their noise exposure levels in their current job. Results Of the participants who were exposed to noise levels less than 85 dBA (decibels with A-weighting filter), 23.8% had hearing loss, and 5.5% of the participants who were exposed to noise ranging from 85 to 89.9 dBA and 11% of the participants who were exposed to noise greater than 90 dBA had audiogram results suggestive of NIHL.

These effects cannot be explained by differences in HPA axis response but recent studies saying that chronic stress induced limbic system alterations spread to nonlimbic areas affecting auditory system might be the key. On the other hand we know that subjects exposed to chronic stress may prove hypersensitivity to novel stressors. The aim of this study is to confirm that occupational chronic stress (OCS) exposure determines vulnerability to acoustic trauma and to establish a method to identify individuals at risk prior to their exposure to high intensity acoustic stimulus.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 60 military personnel with known acoustic trauma injury evidentiated through audiograms and occupational chronic stress exposure quantified through validated questionnaires were exposed to mild novel stressor: occupational medicine evaluation and clinically assessed for maladaptive cardiovascular response (MCVR). Employees were split in two groups, group 1 (MCVR) and group 2 (non MCVR).RESULTS: We found positive correlation between level of perceived OCS and level of hearing loss on entire group and between groups with values of parameters significantly higher in group 1. Subjects exposed to OCS with hypersensitivity to novel stressor evidentiated through maladaptive cardiovascular stress response may be more vulnerable to high intensity acoustic stimulus and consequently acoustic trauma.CONCLUSIONS: Establishing methods and biomarkers that help us indentify individuals at risk of developing acoustic trauma might decrease the high burden of hearing loss."
"25945769","Hearing loss associated with long-term exposure to high-speed dental handpieces.","The purpose of this study was to record and compare audiometric pure tone thresholds of dental clinicians (DCs), dental professionals (DPs), and dental students (DSs); determine the percentage of these groups who use hearing protection devices while at work in the clinic; and measure the sound intensities generated by a few representative high-speed handpieces while they are being used on patients. Participants included DCs who regularly used these handpieces (n = 16), DPs who did not use these handpieces (n = 13), and DSs (n = 8). A questionnaire was used to collect demographic information, assess occupational and recreational noise exposure, and note the level of hearing protection used. A sound level meter was used to measure the sound intensity generated by dental instruments near a clinician's ear. Results showed that DCs who regularly used high-speed handpieces had worse hearing than did members of the other study groups. These results indicate that the implementation of protective strategies should help to reduce the prevalence of occupational hearing loss among DCs. "
"25937134","Evidence for differential modulation of primary and nonprimary auditory cortex by forward masking in tinnitus.","It has been proposed that tinnitus is generated by aberrant neural activity that develops among neurons in tonotopic of regions of primary auditory cortex (A1) affected by hearing loss, which is also the frequency region where tinnitus percepts localize (Eggermont and Roberts 2004; Roberts etal., 2010, 2013). These models suggest (1) that differences between tinnitus and control groups of similar age and audiometric function should depend on whether A1 is probed in tinnitus frequency region (TFR) or below it, and (2) that brain responses evoked from A1 should track changes in the tinnitus percept when residual inhibition (RI) is induced by forward masking. We tested these predictions by measuring (128-channel EEG) the sound-evoked 40-Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR) known to localize tonotopically to neural sources in A1. For comparison the N1 transient response localizing to distributed neural sources in nonprimary cortex (A2) was also studied. When tested under baseline conditions where tinnitus subjects would have heard their tinnitus, ASSR responses were larger in a tinnitus group than in controls when evoked by 500Hz probes while the reverse was true for tinnitus and control groups tested with 5kHz probes, confirming frequency-dependent group differences in this measure. On subsequent trials where RI was induced by masking (narrow band noise centered at 5kHz), ASSR amplitude increased in the tinnitus group probed at 5kHz but not in the tinnitus group probed at 500Hz. When collapsed into a single sample tinnitus subjects reporting comparatively greater RI depth and duration showed comparatively larger ASSR increases after masking regardless of probe frequency. Effects of masking on ASSR amplitude in the control groups were completely reversed from those in the tinnitus groups, with no change seen to 5kHz probes but ASSR increases to 500Hz probes even though the masking sound contained no energy at 500Hz (an &quot;off-frequency&quot; masking effect). In contrast to these findings for the ASSR, N1 amplitude was larger in tinnitus than control groups at both probe frequencies under baseline conditions, decreased after masking in all conditions, and did not relate to RI. These results suggest that aberrant neural activity occurring in the TFR of A1 underlies tinnitus and its modulation during RI. They indicate further that while neural changes occur in A2 in tinnitus, these changes do not reflect the tinnitus percept. Models for tinnitus and forward masking are described that integrate these findings within a common framework. "
"25932612","The incidence of high-frequency hearing loss after microvascular decompression for trigeminal neuralgia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, or geniculate neuralgia.","OBJECT: The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and discuss the pathogenesis of high-frequency hearing loss (HFHL) after microvascular decompression (MVD) for trigeminal neuralgia (TGN), glossopharyngeal neuralgia (GPN), or geniculate neuralgia (GN).METHODS: The authors analyzed preoperative and postoperative audiogram data and brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) from 93 patients with TGN, 6 patients with GPN, and 8 patients with GN who underwent MVD. Differences in pure tone audiometry &gt; 10 dB at frequencies of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 kHz were calculated preoperatively and postoperatively for both the ipsilateral and the contralateral sides. Intraoperative monitoring records were analyzed and compared with the incidence of HFHL, which was defined as a change in pure tone audiometry &gt; 10 dB at frequencies of 4 and 8 kHz.RESULTS: The incidence of HFHL was 30.84% on the side ipsilateral to the surgery and 20.56% on the contralateral side. Of the 47 patients with HFHL, 20 had conductive hearing loss, and 2 experienced nonserviceable hearing loss after the surgery. The incidences of HFHL on the ipsilateral side at 4 and 8 kHz were 17.76% and 25.23%, respectively, and 8.41% and 15.89%, respectively, on the contralateral side. As the audiometric frequency increased, the number of patients with hearing loss increased. No significant postoperative difference was found between patients with and without HFHL in intraoperative BAEP waveforms. Sex, age, and affected side were not associated with an increase in the incidence of hearing loss.CONCLUSIONS: High-frequency hearing loss occurred after MVD for TGN, GPN, or GN, and the greatest incidence occurred on the ipsilateral side. This hearing loss may be a result of drill-induced noise and/or transient loss of cerebrospinal fluid during the course of the procedure. Changes in intraoperative BAEP waveforms were not useful in predicting HFHL after MVD. Repeated postoperative audiological examinations may be useful in assessing the prognosis of HFHL."
"25919036","Evaluation of noise-induced hearing loss by auditory steady-state and auditory brainstem-evoked responses.","OBJECTIVES: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) may result from occupational noise exposures and is considered as an 'Occupational Disease'; therefore, it is compensable. To verify the existence and severity of the work-related hearing loss, there is a need of an objective, reliable auditory measure in cases of arbitration of financial disputes to resolve any medicolegal aspects. The objective of the study was to compare between the ABR and ASSR for predicting the behavioural threshold in subjects with normal hearing or NIHL.DESIGN: The study included 82 subjects regularly exposed to high levels of occupational noise, with normal hearing and NIHL. ABR to clicks and to tone bursts were recorded followed by multiple-frequency ASSR. Physiological and behavioural thresholds were compared for specific frequencies (1000, 2000 Hz) and average of high-frequency range (2000 and 4000 Hz). In addition, Pearson correlations and the specificity and sensitivity of each measure were also calculated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.RESULTS: In the NIHL group, there was a significantly smaller difference between the behavioural threshold and click-ABR than the ASSR in high-frequency range. Pearson correlations were significantly higher for click-ABR. Analysis of specific frequencies yielded a smaller difference between behavioural and ASSR than tone-burst-ABR thresholds, with a slightly better correlation for ASSR than tone-burst-ABR. Higher sensitivity but lower specificity was suggested for ASSR than ABR.CONCLUSIONS: ASSR is associated with high-frequency specificity, shorter test sessions and good correlations with behavioural thresholds, making it a potentially better measure than ABR for predicting audiograms in subjects with NIHL. These findings have diagnostic implications, especially in cases of workers' compensation when subjects may be uncooperative."
"25906840","Total leisure noise exposure and its association with hearing loss among adolescents.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate total leisure noise exposure among adolescents and to assess its association with hearing.DESIGN: Based on self-reported time spent on 19 leisure activities and associated mean sound pressure levels reported in the literature, total leisure noise exposure was evaluated and compared to noise at work limits (&gt; 85 dB(A) = hazardous) in a cross-sectional survey. Tympanometry and pure-tone audiometry was performed in sound isolated rooms.STUDY SAMPLE: The study sample consists of 2143 pupils attending grade nine in any school in a German city 2009-2011 (mean age: 15.4 years; range: 13-19 years). Audiometric data were available for 1837 (85.8%) pupils (53.9% girls).RESULTS: 41.9% of the 2143 adolescents who had provided self-reported data on leisure activities associated with noise exposure were estimated to be hazardously exposed to leisure time noise. The interaction of gender with total leisure time noise exposure was not significant. No association between leisure time noise exposure and audiometric notches could be detected.CONCLUSION: While hearing loss seems seldom in this age group, a high proportion of adolescents aged 15-16 years are exposed to noise levels during leisure time bearing long-term risks of hearing loss."
"25763196","The Impact of Different Permissible Exposure Limits on Hearing Threshold Levels Beyond 25 dBA.","BACKGROUND: Development of noise-induced hearing loss is reliant on a few factors such as frequency, intensity, and duration of noise exposure. The occurrence of this occupational malady has doubled from 120 million to 250 million in a decade. Countries such as Malaysia, India, and the US have adopted 90 dBA as the permissible exposure limit. According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the exposure limit for noise is 90 dBA, while that of the US National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is 85 dBA for 8 hours of noise exposure.OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the development of hearing threshold levels beyond 25 dBA on adoption of 85 dBA as the permissible exposure limit compared to 90 dBA.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is an intervention study done on two automobile factories. There were 203 employees exposed to noise levels beyond the action level. Hearing protection devices were distributed to reduce noise levels to a level between the permissible exposure limit and action level. The permissible exposure limits were 90 and 85 dBA in factories 1 and 2, respectively, while the action levels were 85 and 80 dBA, respectively. The hearing threshold levels of participants were measured at baseline and at first month of postshift exposure of noise. The outcome was measured by a manual audiometer. McNemar and chi-square tests were used in the statistical analysis.RESULTS: We found that hearing threshold levels of more than 25 dBA has changed significantly from pre-intervention to post-intervention among participants from both factories (3000 Hz for the right ear and 2000 Hz for the left ear). There was a statistically significant association between participants at 3000 Hz on the right ear at 'deteriorated' level ( <U+03C7> (1) = 4.08, f = - 0.142, P = 0.043), whereas there was worsening of hearing threshold beyond 25 dBA among those embraced 90 dBA.CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of 85 dBA as the permissible exposure limit has preserved hearing threshold level among participants at 3000 Hz compared to those who embraced 90 dBA."
"25759070","Noise-induced hearing loss and combined noise and vibration exposure.","BACKGROUND: While there is a wide body of literature addressing noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS) independently, relatively few studies have considered the combined effects of noise and vibration. These studies have suggested an increased risk of NIHL in workers with vibration white finger (VWF), though the relationship remains poorly understood.AIMS: To determine whether hearing impairment is worse in noise-exposed workers with VWF than in workers with similar noise exposures but without VWF.METHODS: The Quebec National Institute of Public Health audiometric database was used in conjunction with work-related accident and occupational diseases data from the Quebec workers' compensation board to analyse differences in audiometry results between vibration-exposed workers in the mining and forestry industries and the overall source population, and between mining and forestry workers with documented VWF and those without VWF. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 7029 standards were used to calculate hearing loss not attributable to age.RESULTS: 15751 vibration-exposed workers were identified in an overall source population of 59339. Workers with VWF (n = 96) had significantly worse hearing at every frequency studied (500, 1000, 2000 4000 Hz) compared with other mining and forestry workers without VWF.CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms previous findings of greater hearing loss at higher frequencies in workers with VWF, but also found a significant difference in hearing loss at low frequencies. It therefore supports the association between combined noise and hand-arm vibration (HAV) exposure and NIHL."
"25654653","Measuring the Advantage of Kalman-Weighted Averaging for Auditory Brainstem Response Hearing Evaluation in Infants.","PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to (a) measure the effects of Kalman-weighted averaging methods on auditory brainstem response (ABR) threshold, latency, and amplitude; (b) translate lab findings to the clinical setting; and (c) estimate cost savings when ABRs can be obtained in nonsedated infants.METHOD: ABRs were recorded in 40 adults with normal hearing during induced motor noise conditions using the Kalman-weighted averaging method implemented on a commercial system, the Vivosonic Integrity (Vivosonic Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada). The device was then used to test 34 infants in awake and asleep states. The advantages of the Kalman-weighted averaging method were modeled in terms of time saved for conducting an ABR evaluation.RESULTS: Kalman-weighted ABR threshold estimates were 6-7 dB lower than with conventional methods during induced motor noise. When used to obtain ABRs in infants who were awake, the number of sweeps required to obtain a result was significantly greater than that required for a sleeping infant but well within the range for clinical application.CONCLUSIONS: The use of Kalman-weighted averaging provides a measurable advantage over conventional methods and may reduce costs for the pediatric audiology practice."
"25620313","Efficacy and safety of N-acetylcysteine in prevention of noise induced hearing loss: a randomized clinical trial.","Despite a robust hearing conservation program, military personnel continue to be at high risk for noise induced hearing loss (NIHL). For more than a decade, a number of laboratories have investigated the use of antioxidants as a safe and effective adjunct to hearing conservation programs. Of the antioxidants that have been investigated, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has consistently reduced permanent NIHL in the laboratory, but its clinical efficacy is still controversial. This study provides a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating the safety profile and the efficacy of NAC to prevent hearing loss in a military population after weapons training. Of the 566 total study subjects, 277 received NAC while 289 were given placebo. The null hypothesis for the rate of STS was not rejected based on the measured results. While no significant differences were found for the primary outcome, rate of threshold shifts, the right ear threshold shift rate difference did approach significance (p=0.0562). No significant difference was found in the second primary outcome, percentage of subjects experiencing an adverse event between placebo and NAC groups (26.7% and 27.4%, respectively, p=0.4465). Results for the secondary outcome, STS rate in the trigger hand ear, did show a significant difference (34.98% for placebo-treated, 27.14% for NAC-treated, p-value=0.0288). Additionally, post-hoc analysis showed significant differences in threshold shift rates when handedness was taken into account. While the secondary outcomes and post-hoc analysis suggest that NAC treatment is superior to the placebo, the present study design failed to confirm this. The lack of significant differences in overall hearing loss between the treatment and placebo groups may be due to a number of factors, including suboptimal dosing, premature post-exposure audiograms, or differences in risk between ears or subjects. Based on secondary outcomes and post hoc analyses however, further studies seem warranted and are needed to clarify dose response and the factors that may have played a role in the observed results.

"27991469","Gender differences in use of hearing protection devices among farm operators.","PURPOSE: Although farm operators have frequent exposure to hazardous noise and high rates of noise-induced hearing loss, they have low use of hearing protection devices (HPDs). Women represent about one-third of farm operators, and their numbers are climbing. However, among published studies examining use of HPDs in this worker group, none have examined gender-related differences. The purpose of this study was to examine gender-related differences in use of hearing protection and related predictors among farm operators.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data previously collected at farm shows and by telephone were analyzed using t-tests and generalized linear model with zero inflated negative binomial (ZINB) distribution.FINDINGS: The difference in rate of hearing protector use between men and women farm operators was not significant. There was no difference between men and women in most hearing protector-related attitudes and beliefs.CONCLUSION: Although men and women farm operators had similar rates of use of hearing protectors when working in high-noise environments, attitudes about HPD use differed. Specifically, interpersonal role modeling was a predictor of HPD use among women, but not for men. This difference suggests that while farm operators of both genders may benefit from interventions designed to reduce barriers to HPD use (e.g., difficulty communicating with co-workers and hearing warning sounds), farm women have unique needs in relation to cognitive-perceptual factors that predict HPD use. Women farm operators may lack role models for use of HPDs (e.g., in peers and advertising), contributing to their less frequent use of protection."
"27991463","Parametric method for the noise risk assessment of professional orchestral musicians.","BACKGROUND: The Occupational Health and Safety (OH&amp;S) literature shows that noise could represent a risk factor for professional orchestral musicians. The continuative exposition to elevated noise levels and the particular nature of the activity make necessary an &quot;atypical&quot; OH&amp;S approach, which was identified to be necessarily organizational.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, a parametric-based method for orchestral exposure assessment and management was developed. The goal was to achieve a predictive tool to involve safety in the decision making of concert season program. After setting the parameters, the project's hypothesis was defined and then validated through a yearly-scale monitoring on an important European symphonic orchestra. Moreover, workers' exposure was assessed from the parametric study by a wide measurement campaign.RESULTS: A general validation of the method was obtained by the verification of the main parameters' (repertoire, headcount, and disposition) significant influence on the sound pressure levels produced by the orchestra. Exposure levels comparable to the trends in literature for symphonic orchestras were observed, with criticalities among brass musicians, which was the only group exceeding the upper exposure action values.CONCLUSION: This research has emphasized that the exposure condition of musicians can be critical and requires the implementation of improvement plans. The study has shown that the predictive analysis can be performed on parameters describing the concert's emissive characteristics. The future development of research currently under study will focus on the concert's pieces and the use of parameters as indicators of the exposure context."
"27991461","The viability of hearing protection device fit-testing at navy and marine corps accession points.","INTRODUCTION: The viability of hearing protection device (HPD) verification (i.e., fit-testing) on a large scale was investigated to address this gap in a military accession environment.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Personal Attenuation Ratings (PARs) following self-fitted (SELF-Fit) HPDs were acquired from 320 US Marine Corps training recruits (87.5% male, 12.5% female) across four test protocols (1-, 3-, 5-, and 7- frequency). SELF-Fit failures received follow-up to assess potential causes. Follow-up PARs were acquired (Experimenter fit [EXP-Fit], followed by Subject re-fit [SUB Re-Fit]). EXP-Fit was intended to provide a perception (dubbed &quot;ear canal muscle memory&quot;) of what a correctly fitted HPD should feel like. SUB Re-Fit was completed following EXP-Fit to determine whether a training recruit could duplicate EXP-Fit on her/his own without assistance.RESULTS: A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>320) showed that SELF-Fit means differed significantly between protocols (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). Post-hoc analyses showed that the 1-freq SELF-Fit mean was significantly lower than all other protocols (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.03) by 5.6 dB or more. No difference was found between the multi-frequency protocols. For recruits who were followed up with EXP-Fit (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>79), across all protocols, a significant (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) mean improvement of 25.68 dB (10.99) was found, but PARs did not differ (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.99) between EXP-Fit protocols. For recruits in the 3-freq and 5-freq protocol groups who experienced all three PAR test methods (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>33), PAR methods differed (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) but no method by protocol interaction was found (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.46). Post hoc tests showed that both EXP-Fit and SUB Re-Fit had significantly better attenuation than SELF-Fit (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001), but no difference was found between EXPFit and SUB Re-Fit (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.59). For SELF-Fit, the 1-freq protocol resulted in a 35% pass rate, whereas the 3-, 5-, and 7-freq protocols resulted in &gt;60% pass rates. Results showed that once recruits experienced how HPDs should feel when inserted correctly, they were able to properly replicate the procedure with similar results to the expert fit suggesting &quot;ear canal muscle memory&quot; may be a viable training strategy concomitant with HPD verification. Fit-test duration was also measured to examine the tradeoff between results accuracy and time required to complete each protocol.DISCUSSION: Results from this study showed the critical importance of initial selection and fitting of HPDs followed by verification (i.e., fit-testing) at Navy and Marine Corps accession points. Achieving adequate protection from an HPD is fundamentally dependent on obtaining proper fit of the issued HPD as well as the quality of training recruits receive regarding HPD use."
"27991459","Early indication of noise-induced hearing loss from PMP use in adolescents: A cross-sectional analysis.","CONTEXT: Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) may indicate preclinical noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in adolescents from unsafe personal music player (PMP) use.AIMS: The objective, therefore, was to observe preclinical signs of NIHL in 9th grade adolescents with clinically normal hearing by comparing DPOAE signals between different levels of A-weighted equivalent PMP exposure.SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Subjects were recruited from all secondary-level schools located in the city of Regensburg, Germany during two academic years 2009/2010 and 2010/2011.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A-weighted equivalent sound pressure levels (SPLs) for a 40-hour work week (LAeq,40h) were estimated from questionnaire responses on output and duration of PMP use of the previous week. Subjects were then categorized into four levels of exposure: &lt;80, 80-85, &gt;85 to &lt;90, and =90 A-weighted Decibel [dB(A)]. DPOAE signals were collected by trained audiological staff, applying a standard optimized protocol, at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of the University Hospital Regensburg.STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Mean DPOAE signals were compared between levels by unpaired t test. Novel linear regression models adjusting for other leisure noise exposures and with outcome variables DPoutcome and 4 kilo Hertz (kHz) DPOAEs estimated effects between levels.RESULTS: A total of 1468 subjects (56% female, mostly aged 15 or 16 years) were available for analysis. Comparison of DPOAE means by PMP exposure typically showed no greater than 1<U+2009>dB difference between groups. In fact, comparisons between =90 dB(A) and &lt;80 dB(A) presented the least differences in magnitude. Both DPoutcome and 4<U+2009>kHz linear regression models presented a weak association with the 4-level PMP exposure variable. An expected dose-response to PMP exposure was not observed in any analyses.CONCLUSIONS: DPOAE signal strength alone cannot indicate preclinical NIHL in adolescents."
"27989949","The effect of sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus on speech recognition over air and bone conduction military communications headsets.","Military personnel are at risk for hearing loss due to noise exposure during deployment (USACHPPM, 2008). Despite mandated use of hearing protection, hearing loss and tinnitus are prevalent due to reluctance to use hearing protection. Bone conduction headsets can offer good speech intelligibility for normal hearing (NH) listeners while allowing the ears to remain open in quiet environments and the use of hearing protection when needed. Those who suffer from tinnitus, the experience of perceiving a sound not produced by an external source, often show degraded speech recognition; however, it is unclear whether this is a result of decreased hearing sensitivity or increased distractibility (Moon etal., 2015). It has been suggested that the vibratory stimulation of a bone conduction headset might ameliorate the effects of tinnitus on speech perception; however, there is currently no research to support or refute this claim (Hoare etal., 2014). Speech recognition of words presented over air conduction and bone conduction headsets was measured for three groups of listeners: NH, sensorineural hearing impaired, and/or tinnitus sufferers. Three levels of speech-to-noise (SNR=0,-6,-12dB) were created by embedding speech items in pink noise. Better speech recognition performance was observed with the bone conduction headset regardless of hearing profile, and speech intelligibility was a function of SNR. Discussion will include study limitations and the implications of these findings for those serving in the military."
"27979368","Extended high frequency audiometry in users of personal listening devices.","PURPOSE: Noise exposure leads to high frequency hearing loss. Use of Personal Listening Devices may lead to decline in high frequency hearing sensitivity because of prolonged exposure to these devices at high volume. This study explores the changes in hearing thresholds by Extended High Frequency audiometry in users of personal listening devices.MATERIAL AND METHOD: A descriptive, hospital based observational study was performed with total 100 subjects in age group of 15-30years. Subjects were divided in two groups consisting of 30 subjects (Group A) with no history of Personal Listening Devices use and (Group B) having 70 subjects with history of use of Personal Listening Devices. Conventional pure tone audiometry with extended high frequency audiometry was performed in all the subjects.RESULT: Significant differences in hearing thresholds of Personal Listening Device users were seen at high frequencies (3kHz, 4kHz and 6kHz) and extended high frequencies (9kHz, 10kHz, 11kHz, 13kHz, 14kHz, 15kHz and 16kHz) with p value &lt;0.05. Elevated hearing thresholds were observed in personal listening devices users which were directly proportional to volume and duration of usage.CONCLUSION: In present study no significant changes were noted in hearing thresholds in PLD users before 5years of PLD use. However, hearing thresholds were significantly increased at 3kHz, 10kHz, 13kHz in PLD users having &gt;5years usage at high volume. Thus, it can be reasonably concluded that extended high frequencies can be used for early detection of NIHL in PLD users."

"27913314","Audiologic characteristics in a sample of recently-separated military Veterans: The Noise Outcomes in Servicemembers Epidemiology Study (NOISE Study).","Military Service Members are often exposed to high levels of occupational noise, solvents, and other exposures that can be damaging to the auditory system. Little is known about hearing loss and how it progresses in Veterans following military service. This epidemiology study is designed to evaluate and monitor a cohort of Veterans for 20 years or more to determine how hearing loss changes over time and how those changes are related to noise exposure and other ototoxic exposures encountered during military service. Data reported here are from baseline assessments of the first 100 study participants (84 males; 16 females; mean age 33.5 years; SD 8.8; range 21-58). Each participant was asked to complete a comprehensive audiologic examination and self-report questionnaires regarding sociodemographic characteristics, noise and solvent exposures, health conditions common among post-deployment Veterans, and the social and emotional consequences of hearing loss. For this relatively young cohort, 29% exhibited hearing loss, defined as average hearing threshold &gt;20dB HL in the conventional audiometric range. Forty-two percent exhibited hearing loss in the extended-high-frequency audiometric range using the same criterion (average hearing threshold &gt;20dB HL). Certain factors were found to be associated with poorer hearing in both conventional and extended-high-frequency ranges, including age, type of military branch, years of military service, number of military deployments, noise exposure, tinnitus, and a positive screen for post-traumatic stress disorder. Although the majority of participants had hearing within normal limits, 27% reported a self-perceived mild/moderate hearing handicap and 14% reported a significant handicap. Further research is needed to identify a cause for this discrepancy in audiologic results versus self-report. The information obtained from this longitudinal study could be used in future resource planning with the goal of preventing, as much as possible, the development of hearing loss during military service, and the exacerbation of prevalent hearing loss after military service and over Veterans' lifetimes."

"27876480","Noise dosimetry for tactical environments.","Noise exposure and the subsequent hearing loss are well documented aspects of military life. Numerous studies have indicated high rates of noise-induced hearing injury (NIHI) in active-duty service men and women, and recent statistics from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs indicate a population of veterans with hearing loss that is growing at an increasing rate. In an effort to minimize hearing loss, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) updated its Hearing Conservation Program in 2010, and also has recently revised the DoD Design Criteria Standard Noise Limits (MIL-STD-1474E) which defines allowable noise levels in the design of all military acquisitions including weapons and vehicles. Even with such mandates, it remains a challenge to accurately quantify the noise exposure experienced by a Warfighter over the course of a mission or training exercise, or even in a standard work day. Noise dosimeters are intended for exactly this purpose, but variations in device placement (e.g., free-field, on-body, in/near-ear), hardware (e.g., microphone, analog-to-digital converter), measurement time (e.g., work day, 24-h), and dose metric calculations (e.g., time-weighted energy, peak levels, Auditory Risk Units), as well as noise types (e.g., continuous, intermittent, impulsive) can cause exposure measurements to be incomplete, inaccurate, or inappropriate for a given situation. This paper describes the design of a noise dosimeter capable of acquiring exposure data across tactical environments. Two generations of prototypes have been built at MIT Lincoln Laboratory with funding from the U.S. Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. Details related to hardware, signal processing, and testing efforts are provided, along with example tactical military noise data and lessons learned from early fieldings. Finally, we discuss the continued need to prioritize personalized dosimetry in order to improve models that predict or characterize the risk of auditory damage, to integrate dosimeters with hearing-protection devices, and to inform strategies and metrics for reducing NIHI."

Based on the prevalence rates, 2 different spreadsheet models were constructed in order to compare the prevalence rates of various groups of workers with the expected rates. The spreadsheets were then tested on 10 different occupational groups with varying degrees of hearing loss as compared to a reference population.RESULTS: Hearing of office workers, train drivers, conductors and teachers differed little from the screened reference values based on the Norwegian and the NIOSH criterion. The construction workers, miners, farmers and military had an impaired hearing and railway maintenance workers and bus drivers had a mildly impaired hearing. The spreadsheet models give a valid assessment of the hearing loss.CONCLUSIONS: The use of spreadsheet models to compare hearing in occupational groups with that of a reference population is a simple and quick method. The results are in line with comparable hearing thresholds, and allow for significance testing. The method is believed to be useful for occupational health services in the assessment of risk of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) and the preventive potential in groups of noise-exposed workers.

"27819698","Directivity of hearing of auditory danger signal emitted by overhead crane.","BACKGROUND: The objective of the research has been to provide an answer to the question of what the possibilities of determining the direction of approach of the auditory danger signal emitted by an overhead crane appropriately are. Cases of use and no use of earmuffs (in the passive mode and level-dependent ones) were all taken into consideration.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The auditory danger signal and ambient noise were recorded in an industrial hall. Signals were reproduced at an experimental set-up, using a large number of speakers. Eight speakers for reproduction of the auditory danger signal were placed above a subject's head. The study participants would indicate the direction from which, according to them, the auditory danger signal was being emitted.RESULTS: The average percentage rate of the correct localization amounted to 75.8% when the overhead crane's signal wasn't masked. The presence of ambient noise caused a reduction of the number of correctly identified localization to 66.6%. The use of earmuffs in the passive mode resulted in the worst results (44.5%). There is some improvement when level-dependent earmuffs are used (57.3%).CONCLUSIONS: In situations where it is important to identify the direction from which the auditory danger signal generated by the crane's signaling device is approaching, it is beneficial to use level-dependent earmuffs rather than earmuffs in the passive mode. Correct identification of whether the auditory danger signal generated by the crane's signaling device is approaching from the left or right side is almost perfect, however correct identification of whether the signal is approaching from the front or back of a person is not always possible.

Hearing readiness and conservation practices differ among the four largest uniformed military services (Air Force, Army, Marine Corps, and Navy). Utilizing a data set consisting of all hearing loss claims submitted to the VA from fiscal years 2003-2013, we examined characteristics of veterans submitting claims within one year of separation from military service. Our results indicate that having a hearing loss disability claim granted was significantly more likely for men, individuals over the age of 26yearsat the time of the claim, individuals most recently serving in the U.S. Army, and those with at least one hearing loss diagnosis. Importantly, individuals with at least one test record in the Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System-Hearing Conservation (DOEHRS-HC) system were significantly less likely to have a hearing loss disability claim granted by the VA. Within the DOEHRS-HC cohort, those with at least one threshold shift or clinical hearing loss diagnosis while on active duty were more than two and three times more likely to have a hearing loss disability claim granted, respectively. These findings indicate that an established history of reduced hearing ability while on active duty was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of an approved hearing loss disability claim relative to VA claims without such a history. Further, our results show a persistent decreased rate of hearing loss disability awards overall. These findings support increased inclusion of personnel in DoD hearing readiness and conservation programs to reduce VA hearing loss disability awards."
"27770620","Performance in noise: Impact of reduced speech intelligibility on Sailor performance in a Navy command and control environment.","Noise, hearing loss, and electronic signal distortion, which are common problems in military environments, can impair speech intelligibility and thereby jeopardize mission success. The current study investigated the impact that impaired communication has on operational performance in a command and control environment by parametrically degrading speech intelligibility in a simulated shipborne Combat Information Center. Experienced U.S. Navy personnel served as the study participants and were required to monitor information from multiple sources and respond appropriately to communications initiated by investigators playing the roles of other personnel involved in a realistic Naval scenario. In each block of the scenario, an adaptive intelligibility modification system employing automatic gain control was used to adjust the signal-to-noise ratio to achieve one of four speech intelligibility levels on a Modified Rhyme Test: No Loss, 80%, 60%, or 40%. Objective and subjective measures of operational performance suggested that performance systematically degraded with decreasing speech intelligibility, with the largest drop occurring between 80% and 60%. These results confirm the importance of noise reduction, good communication design, and effective hearing conservation programs to maximize the operational effectiveness of military personnel."

Thirty adult Spraque Dawley rats were randomized into four groups following exposure to acoustic trauma for 4h. Control group (n=7) did not receive further treatment. Thymoquinone-20 (n=8) and Thymoquinone-40 (n=8) received 20 and 40mg/kg of intraperitoneal thymoquinone, respectively. Corn-oil group (n=7) received 1ml of corn oil intraperitoneally. Hearing function of both ears was tested with distortion-product otoacoustic emission and auditory brainstem response before, and shortly after acoustic trauma, and 96h following acoustic trauma. Post-trauma signal/noise ratios and wave V amplitude/latencies of all groups were significantly low compared with pre-trauma values, which indicate no preventive effect of thymoquinone. Rats in Thymoquinone-20 showed a significantly improved distortion-product otoacoustic emission and auditory brainstem response results at 4000 frequency and above in post-treatment tests (p&lt;0.05). Improvement in Thymoquinone-40 at the same frequencies was insignificantly inferior to Thymoquinone-20, yet superior to control and corn-oil groups (p&lt;0.05). We conclude that thymoquinone may not prevent acoustic trauma-induced hearing loss, however, at 20mg/kg for 96h, may repair the damage."

"27613755","Genetic variation in EYA4 on the risk of noise-induced hearing loss in Chinese steelworks firm sample.","OBJECTIVES: Noise-induced hearing loss is one of the most serious occupational diseases worldwide. It is caused by interactions between environmental and genetic factors. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between the genetic susceptibility of the eye absent homolog 4 (EYA4) gene and the risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss in China.METHODS: A case-control association study was carried out with 326 hearing loss cases and 326 controls matched with age and duration of noise exposure, drawn from a cohort of steel workers. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the EYA4 were selected and genotyped. Logistic regression was performed to analyse the main effect of genotypes and interactions between genotypes and individual/environmental factors adjusted for confounding factors. Moreover, generalised multiple dimensionality reduction was applied to further detect interaction among the 5 selected SNPs.RESULTS: Analysis revealed that locus polymorphism of rs3813346 was associated with the risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss in the dominance model, the codominance model and the addictive model (p=0.004, 0.009 and 0.003, respectively). A significant interaction between rs9321402 and cumulative noise exposure was found (p=0.002). A significant main effect p value (p=0.006) was obtained in the high-level exposure group (cumulative noise exposure =98 dB(A)). Generalised multiple dimensionality reduction indicated that the combined interaction of the 2 loci-rs3813346 and rs9493627-significantly affected the incidence of noise-induced hearing loss.CONCLUSIONS: The research suggests that EYA4 genetic variant and its interaction with noise levels may modify the susceptibility to develop noise-induced hearing loss in Chinese population."

"27540829","A faceoff with hazardous noise: Noise exposure and hearing threshold shifts of indoor hockey officials.","Noise exposure and hearing thresholds of indoor hockey officials of the Western States Hockey League were measured to assess the impact of hockey game noise on hearing sensitivity. Twenty-nine hockey officials who officiated the league in an arena in southeastern Wyoming in October, November, and December 2014 participated in the study. Personal noise dosimetry was conducted to determine if officials were exposed to an equivalent sound pressure level greater than 85 dBA. Hearing thresholds were measured before and after hockey games to determine if a 10dB or greater temporary threshold shift in hearing occurred. Pure-tone audiometry was conducted in both ears at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000Hz. All noise exposures were greater than 85 dBA, with a mean personal noise exposure level of 93 dBA (SD = 2.2), providing 17.7% (SD = 6.3) of the officials' daily noise dose according to the OSHA criteria. Hearing threshold shifts of 10dB or greater were observed in 86.2% (25/29) of officials, with 36% (9/25) of those threshold shifts equaling 15dB or greater. The largest proportion of hearing threshold shifts occurred at 4000Hz, comprising 35.7% of right ear shifts and 31.8% of left ear shifts. The threshold shifts between the pre- and post-game audiometry were statistically significant in the left ear at 500 (p=.019), 2000 (p=.0009), 3000 (p&lt;.0001) and 4000 Hz (p=.0002), and in the right ear at 2000 (p=.0001), 3000 (p=.0001) and 4000 Hz (p&lt;.0001), based on Wilcoxon-ranked sum analysis. Although not statistically significant at alpha = 0.05, logistic regression indicated that with each increase of one dB of equivalent sound pressure measured from personal noise dosimetry, the odds of a = 10 dB TTS were increased in the left ear at 500 (OR=1.33, 95% CI 0.73-2.45), 3000 (OR=1.02, 95% CI 0.68-1.51), 4000 (OR=1.26, 95% CI 0.93-1.71) and 8000 Hz (OR=1.22, 95% CI 0.76-1.94) and in the right ear at 6000 (OR=1.03, 95% CI 0.14-7.84) and 8000 Hz (OR=1.29, 95% CI 0.12-13.83). These findings suggest that indoor hockey officials are exposed to hazardous levels of noise, experience temporary hearing loss after officiating games, and a hearing conservation program is warranted. Further temporary threshold shift research has the potential to identify officials of other sporting events that are at an increased risk of noise-induced hearing loss."

"27488035","Hearing impairment and contributing factors among fertilizer factory workers.","INTRODUCTION: Hearing impairment remains the main occupational health problem in the manufacturing industry, and its contributing factors have not been well controlled.METHODS: Unmatched case control and comparative studies were carried out among fertilizer factory workers in Sarawak with the aim of determining contributing factors for hearing impairment. Respondents consisted of 49 cases that were diagnosed from 2005 to 2008 with 98 controls from the same work places. Chi-square test and Mann-Whitney test were used in a univariate analysis to determine the association between hearing impairment and the contributing risks being studied.RESULTS: The results of the univariate analysis showed that hearing impairment was significantly (p&lt;0.05) associated with older age, lower education level, high smoking dose, high occupational daily noise dose, longer duration of service, infrequent used of hearing protection device (HPD), and low perception of sound on HPD usage. Multivariate logistic regression of hearing impairment after controlling for age found the following five variables: occupational daily noise dose =50% (OR 3.48, 95% CI 1.36-8.89), =15 years of services (OR 2.92, 95% CI 1.16-7.33), infrequent use of HPD (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.15-6.77), low perception of sound on HPD (POR 2.77, 95% CI 1.09-6.97), and smoking more than 20 packs per year (OR 4.71, 95% CI 1.13-19.68).DISCUSSION: In conclusion, high occupational noise exposure level, longer duration of service, low perception of sound on HPD, infrequent used of HPD, and smoking more than 20 packs per year were the contributing factors to hearing impairment, and appropriate intervention measures should be proposed and taken into considerations."

"27445661","Decreased Speech-In-Noise Understanding in Young Adults with Tinnitus.","OBJECTIVES: Young people are often exposed to high music levels which make them more at risk to develop noise-induced symptoms such as hearing loss, hyperacusis, and tinnitus of which the latter is the symptom perceived the most by young adults. Although, subclinical neural damage was demonstrated in animal experiments, the human correlate remains under debate. Controversy exists on the underlying condition of young adults with normal hearing thresholds and noise-induced tinnitus (NIT) due to leisure noise. The present study aimed to assess differences in audiological characteristics between noise-exposed adolescents with and without NIT.METHODS: A group of 87 young adults with a history of recreational noise exposure was investigated by use of the following tests: otoscopy, impedance measurements, pure-tone audiometry including high-frequencies, transient and distortion product otoacoustic emissions, speech-in-noise testing with continuous and modulated noise (amplitude-modulated by 15 Hz), auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and questionnaires.Nineteen students reported NIT due to recreational noise exposure, and their measures were compared to the non-tinnitus subjects.RESULTS: No significant differences between tinnitus and non-tinnitus subjects could be found for hearing thresholds, otoacoustic emissions, and ABR results.Tinnitus subjects had significantly worse speech reception in noise compared to non-tinnitus subjects for sentences embedded in steady-state noise (mean speech reception threshold (SRT) scores, respectively -5.77 and -6.90 dB SNR; p = 0.025) as well as for sentences embedded in 15 Hz AM-noise (mean SRT scores, respectively -13.04 and -15.17 dB SNR; p = 0.013). In both groups speech reception was significantly improved during AM-15 Hz noise compared to the steady-state noise condition (p &lt; 0.001). However, the modulation masking release was not affected by the presence of NIT.CONCLUSIONS: Young adults with and without NIT did not differ regarding audiometry, OAE, and ABR.However, tinnitus patients showed decreased speech-in-noise reception. The results are discussed in the light of previous findings suggestion NIT may occur in the absence of measurable peripheral damage as reflected in speech-in-noise deficits in tinnitus subjects."

"27364108","[Do hearing threshold levels in workers of the furniture industry reflect their exposure to noise?].","BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to analyze the hearing status of employees of a furniture factory with respect to their exposure to noise and the presence of additional risk factors of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).MATERIAL AND METHODS: Noise measurements, questionnaire survey and assessment of hearing, using pure tone audiometry, were carried out in 50 male workers, aged 20-57 years, directly employed in the manufacture of furniture. The actual workers' hearing threshold levels (HTLs) were compared with the predictions calculated according to PN-ISO 1999:2000 based on age, gender and noise exposure.RESULTS: Workers under study were exposed to noise at daily noise exposure levels of 82.7-94.8 dB (mean: 90.9 dB) for a period of 3-14 years. In all subjects, mean HTL at 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz did not exceed 25 dB. Nevertheless, high frequency notches were found in 11% of audiograms. The actual workers' HTLs at 3000-6000 Hz were similar to those predicted using PN-ISO 1999:2000. There were statistical significant differences between HTLs in subgroups of people with higher (&gt; 78 mm Hg) and lower (= 78 mm Hg) diastolic blood pressure, smokers and non-smokers, and those working with organic solvents. Hearing loss was more evident in subjects affected by the additional risk factors specified above.CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the need to consider, in addition to noise, also some other NIHL risk factors, such as tobacco smoking, elevated blood pressure, and co-exposure to organic solvents when estimating the risk of NIHL and developing the hearing conservation programs for workers.

"27354478","Comprehensive Audiometric Analysis of Hearing Impairment and Tinnitus After Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy in Survivors of Adult-Onset Cancer.","PURPOSE: Cisplatin is widely used but highly ototoxic. Effects of cumulative cisplatin dose on hearing loss have not been comprehensively evaluated in survivors of adult-onset cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Comprehensive audiological measures were conducted on 488 North American male germ cell tumor (GCT) survivors in relation to cumulative cisplatin dose, including audiograms (0.25 to 12 kHz), tests of middle ear function, and tinnitus. American Speech-Language-Hearing Association criteria defined hearing loss severity. The geometric mean of hearing thresholds (0.25 to 12 kHz) summarized overall hearing status consistent with audiometric guidelines. Patients were sorted into quartiles of hearing thresholds of age- and sex-matched controls.RESULTS: Increasing cumulative cisplatin dose (median, 400 mg/m(2); range, 200 to 800 mg/m(2)) was significantly related to hearing loss at 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 kHz (P trends, .021 to &lt; .001): every 100 mg/m(2) increase resulted in a 3.2-dB impairment in age-adjusted overall hearing threshold (4 to 12 kHz; P&lt; .001). Cumulative cisplatin doses &gt; 300 mg/m(2) were associated with greater American Speech-Language-Hearing Association-defined hearing loss severity (odds ratio, 1.59; P = .0066) and worse normative-matched quartiles (odds ratio, 1.33; P = .093) compared with smaller doses. Almost one in five (18%) patients had severe to profound hearing loss. Tinnitus (40% patients) was significantly correlated with reduced hearing at each frequency (P&lt; .001). Noise-induced damage (10% patients) was unaffected by cisplatin dose (P = .59). Hypertension was significantly related (P = .0066) to overall hearing threshold (4 to 12 kHz) in age- and cisplatin dose-adjusted analyses. Middle ear deficits occurred in 22.3% of patients but, as expected, were not related to cytotoxic drug dosage.CONCLUSION: Follow-up of adult-onset cancer survivors given cisplatin should include routine inquiry for hearing status and tinnitus, referral to audiologists as clinically indicated, and hypertension control. Patients should be urged to avoid noise exposure, ototoxic drugs, and other factors that further damage hearing."
"27349914","Prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex vs. auditory brainstem response for hearing assessment.","The high prevalence of noise-induced and age-related hearing loss in the general population has warranted the use of animal models to study the etiology of these pathologies. Quick and accurate auditory threshold determination is a prerequisite for experimental manipulations targeting hearing loss in animal models. The standard auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurement is fairly quick and translational across species, but is limited by the need for anesthesia and a lack of perceptual assessment. The goal of this study was to develop a new method of hearing assessment utilizing prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle reflex, a commonly used tool that measures detection thresholds in awake animals, and can be performed on multiple animals simultaneously. We found that in control mice PPI audiometric functions are similar to both ABR and traditional operant conditioning audiograms. The hearing thresholds assessed with PPI audiometry in sound exposed mice were also similar to those detected by ABR thresholds one day after exposure. However, three months after exposure PPI threshold shifts were still evident at and near the frequency of exposure whereas ABR thresholds recovered to the pre-exposed level. In contrast, PPI audiometry and ABR wave one amplitudes detected similar losses. PPI audiometry provides a high throughput automated behavioral screening tool of hearing in awake animals. Overall, PPI audiometry and ABR assessments of the auditory system are robust techniques with distinct advantages and limitations, which when combined, can provide ample information about the functionality of the auditory system."
"27340983","Hearing Loss in Persons Exposed and not Exposed to Occupational Noise.","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare hearing loss in individuals at risk and those not at risk for occupational noise and to compare working loss by gender.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis used data from a current Czech Ministry of Health grant project called Epidemiological and Genetic Study of the Frequency of Hearing Loss (2011 to 2015; NT12246-5/2011). The analyzed sample comprised 4988 participants. Hearing was tested using pure-tone threshold audiometry, tympanometry, and measurement of the stapedius reflex.RESULTS: Females at risk and those not at risk for occupational noise who were younger than 44 years and older than 75 years were found to have no statistically significant differences at any pure-tone threshold audiometry frequency. In females aged 45 to 74 years, statistically significant differences were found. In males, hearing loss was observed as early as 18 years of age. When comparing males and females at no risk for occupational noise, there were no statistically significant differences at any of the frequencies in those younger than 29 years. In females aged 30 years or older, statistically significant differences were observed at various frequencies in all age groups. When comparing males and females at risk for occupational noise, statistically significant differences were more frequent than in employees not exposed to noise.CONCLUSION: Hearing loss in females does not significantly vary depending on occupational exposure. The opposite is true for males. However, the maximum differences in mean levels did not exceed 10 dB. It is therefore clear that noise is a preventable factor, and the use of personal protective equipment is warranted."
"27340639","Effects of Hyperlipidemia on Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL).","Likelihood of developing noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) is affected by some factors such as genes, nutrition and healthy hearing habits. We investigated this study to determine the effect of hyperlipidemia on NIHL. In a case-control study, 144 workers who exposed to continuous noise more than 85 dBA (88-89 dBA) from a textile factory in Tehran were examined. Serum Blood test results as index for dyslipidemi, were collected and audiometry tests were carried out to analyze the association of hyperlipidemian and NIHL. The meanSD of Cholesterol level for NIHL and control were 188.19 (28.46) and 159.00 (26.66) mg/dL respectively. Also the meanSD of Triglyceride level for NIHL and control were 203.75 (53.92) and 105.00 (30.50) mg/dL consecutively. After adjusting odds ratio (OR) for NIHL, only hypertriglyceridemia had association with NIHL. (aOR=1.07; 95% CI 1.04-1.10), and there wasn't any relation between hypercholestomia and NIHL (aOR=1.02; 95% CI 0.99-1.05). Workers with hypertriglyceridemia are at increased risk for NIHL. In factories with elevated noise levels, besides hearing conservation programs, attention to blood serum level of workers and healthy diet are proposed to help in preserving hearing threshold. "

The questionnaires were adopted to collect individual features and audiometry tests performed. In the sstudy, 286 subjects were diagnosed as cases, Which were each designated on the basis of the matched criterion, and 286 paired samples were selected finally. Noise intensity was measured according to the standards given in 'Measurement of Noise in the Workplace'(Occupational Health Standard of the People's Republic of China, GBZ/T189.8-2007). Cumulative noise exposure (CNE) was calculated, according to monitoring data on A-weighed sound pressure level and employment time. Genomic DNA was obtained from peripheral blood samples using 2 mL DNA extraction Kit following the manufacturer's protocol. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of GRHL2 were genotyped by multiplex SNP genotyping kit. The continuous variables and categorical variables were analyzed by t-test and chi-square test respectively. Multivariate Logistic regression was used to test the association between genetic frequency and disease status, with adjustments for the possible confounding variables. The haplotypes were established and their frequencies in the two groups were assessed by haploview and phase softwares.RESULTS: All the five SNPs (rs3735713, rs3824090, rs3735714, rs3735715 and rs611419) were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) (P&gt;0.05). The subjects carrying rs3735715 GG genotype had a higher NIHL risk than those carrying the GA genotype under the co-dominant model (OR=0.644, 95% CI: 0.442-0.939, P=0.022) after adjustment for height, blood pressure, drinking status and smoking status. After being stratified by CNE, in the CNE = 98 dB (A) group, rs3735715 polymorphism was associated with the NIHL under the co-dominant model (OR=0.509, 95% CI: 0.281-0.923, P=0.026) after adjustment for height, blood pressure, drinking status and smoking status as well. However, no statistical significant difference was found in variant genotypes of the other SNPs between the case and control subjects. Four-locus (rs3735713, rs3824090, rs3735714 and rs3735715) haplotypes were constructed, and no risk or protective haplotypes was identified.CONCLUSION: It is suggested that GRHL2 polymorphisms may be associated with development of NIHL."

In order to examine the effects of blast injury on hearing sensitivity, we developed a large database composed of demographic, audiometric, point of injury, and medical outcome data, with the primary aim of developing a long-standing and integrated capability for the surveillance, assessment, and investigation of blast-related hearing outcomes. Methods used to develop the dataset are described. Encompassing more than 16,500 Navy and Marine Corps personnel, the Blast-Related Auditory Injury Database (BRAID) includes individuals with a blast-related injury and nonblast control subjects. Using baseline and postdeployment hearing threshold data, a retrospective analysis of the cohort revealed that the rate of hearing loss for the injured servicemembers was 39%. The BRAID will be useful for studies that assess hearing patterns following deployment-related injury, such as blast exposures, that facilitate exploration of health outcomes and whether they are predictive of audiometric disposition and that help establish hearing loss prevention strategies and program policies for affected military commands and servicemembers.

Effects of personal music system use on hearing were evaluated using pure tone audiometry (in conventional and extended high frequency ranges), transient evoked otoacoustic emissions, syllable identification in noise, intensity discrimination, frequency discrimination and temporal modulation transfer function.RESULTS: Results showed, alarmingly, that large proportions of young adults are using personal music systems at levels higher than the safety limits set by regulatory bodies. Individuals who listened to personal music systems at levels higher than 80 dB LAeq exhibited poorer extended high frequency thresholds, reduced transient evoked otoacoustic emission amplitudes, poorer frequency discrimination, reduced modulation detection thresholds at 32 Hz modulation frequency, and reduced syllable identification in noise at -5 dB signal-to-noise ratio. Listening levels were significantly correlated with extended high frequency thresholds and transient evoked otoacoustic emission amplitudes.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that listening to music through personal music systems at higher volume levels may be hazardous to hearing."

Ebselen (also known as 2-phenyl-1,2-benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one) has shown promising activity in clinical trials for cerebral ischemia, bipolar disorder, and noise-induced hearing loss. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in exploring the antibacterial properties of ebselen. In this study, we synthesized an ebselen-inspired library of 33 compounds where the selenium atom has been replaced by sulfur (ebsulfur derivatives) and evaluated them against a panel of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant S. aureus and non-S. aureus strains. Within our library, we identified three outstanding analogues with potent activity against all S. aureus strains tested (MIC values mostly <U+2A7D>2g/mL), and numerous additional ones with overall very good to good antibacterial activity (1-7.8g/mL). We also characterized the time-kill analysis, anti-biofilm ability, hemolytic activity, mammalian cytotoxicity, membrane-disruption ability, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production of some of these analogues."

"27030779","Broadband noise exposure does not affect hearing sensitivity in big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus).","In many vertebrates, exposure to intense sounds under certain stimulus conditions can induce temporary threshold shifts that reduce hearing sensitivity. Susceptibility to these hearing losses may reflect the relatively quiet environments in which most of these species have evolved. Echolocating big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) live in extremely intense acoustic environments in which they navigate and forage successfully, both alone and in company with other bats. We hypothesized that bats may have evolved a mechanism to minimize noise-induced hearing losses that otherwise could impair natural echolocation behaviors. The hearing sensitivity of seven big brown bats was measured in active echolocation and passive hearing tasks, before and after exposure to broadband noise spanning their audiometric range (10-100 kHz, 116 dB SPL re. 20 Pa rms, 1 h duration; sound exposure level 152 dB). Detection thresholds measured 20 min, 2 h or 24 h after exposure did not vary significantly from pre-exposure thresholds or from thresholds in control (sham exposure) conditions. These results suggest that big brown bats may be less susceptible to temporary threshold shifts than are other terrestrial mammals after exposure to similarly intense broadband sounds. These experiments provide fertile ground for future research on possible mechanisms employed by echolocating bats to minimize hearing losses while orienting effectively in noisy biological soundscapes."
"26968456","Double Jeopardy: Hearing Loss and Tinnitus Among Noise-Exposed Workers.","The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of tinnitus and assess the relationship between tinnitus and hearing loss among firefighters and operating engineers, who are exposed to noise on-the-job. The study analyzed existing data from two different populations (154 firefighters and 769 operating engineers) who completed a survey and audiometric tests as part of a hearing loss prevention intervention study. Approximately 40% of both groups reported tinnitus; 34% of firefighters and 59% of operating engineers showed hearing loss at noise-sensitive frequencies (4 kHz and 6 kHz). Firefighters with high frequency hearing loss (odds ratio [OR] = 2.31; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.05, 5.11]) and those with perceived impaired hearing status (OR = 3.53; 95% CI = [1.27, 9.80]) were significantly more likely to report tinnitus. Similarly, operating engineers who had hearing loss at both low (OR = 2.10; 95% CI = [1.40, 3.15]) and high frequencies (OR = 2.00; 95% CI = [1.37, 2.90]), and perceived impaired hearing status (OR = 2.17; 95% CI = [1.55, 3.05]) were twice as likely to report tinnitus. This study demonstrated that tinnitus is a considerable problem for noise-exposed workers. Workers with hearing loss demonstrated significantly higher rates of tinnitus. Comprehensive workplace hearing conservation programs should include tinnitus management for noise-exposed workers, along with other key elements such as noise control and hearing protection. "

This cross-sectional study associates occupational noise exposure with hearing loss in commercial fishermen.METHODS: A comprehensive survey and audiometric testing were administered to 227 participants in the Gulf Coast. Sound-level measurements were obtained aboard a sample of fishing vessels. Criteria specific for hearing impairment (HI) and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) were applied to each audiogram.RESULTS: The majority of these fishermen work shifts more than 16 <U+200A>hours for an extended duration. Hazardous noise levels were measured in the engine rooms ranging from 94.8 to 105.0<U+200A>dBA. NIHL was significantly associated with years spent fishing, but not with age. HI was significantly associated with age, but not with years fishing.CONCLUSIONS: Commercial fishermen in the Gulf may be at a considerable risk of occupational NIHL and would benefit from hearing conservation programs."

The hazardous effects of epoxy adhesives remain unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the risk of hearing loss among workers exposed to epoxy adhesives and noise.DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.METHODS: For this cross-sectional study, we recruited 182 stone workers who were exposed to both epoxy adhesives and noise, 89 stone workers who were exposed to noise only, and 43 workers from the administrative staff who had not been exposed to adhesives or noise. We obtained demographic data, occupational history and medical history through face-to-face interviews and arranged physical examinations and pure-tone audiometric tests. We also conducted walk-through surveys in the stone industry. A total of 40 representative noise assessments were conducted in 15 workplaces. Air sampling was conducted at 40 workplaces, and volatile organic compounds were analysed using the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) TO-15 method.RESULTS: The mean sound pressure level was 87.7 dBA (SD 9.9). The prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss was considerably increased in the stone workers exposed to epoxy adhesives (42%) compared with the stone workers who were not exposed to epoxy adhesives (21%) and the administrative staff group (9.3%). A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that exposure to epoxy adhesives significantly increased the risk of hearing loss between 2 and 6 kHz after adjusting for age. Significant interactions between epoxy adhesives and noise and hearing impairment were observed at 3, 4 and 6 kHz.CONCLUSIONS: Epoxy adhesives exacerbate hearing impairment in noisy environments, with the main impacts occurring in the middle and high frequencies."
"26869944","Auditory Perceptual Learning in Adults with and without Age-Related Hearing Loss.","Introduction : Speech recognition in adverse listening conditions becomes more difficult as we age, particularly for individuals with age-related hearing loss (ARHL). Whether these difficulties can be eased with training remains debated, because it is not clear whether the outcomes are sufficiently general to be of use outside of the training context. The aim of the current study was to compare training-induced learning and generalization between normal-hearing older adults and those with ARHL. Methods : Fifty-six listeners (60-72 y/o), 35 participants with ARHL, and 21 normal hearing adults participated in the study. The study design was a cross over design with three groups (immediate-training, delayed-training, and no-training group). Trained participants received 13 sessions of home-based auditory training over the course of 4 weeks. Three adverse listening conditions were targeted: (1) Speech-in-noise, (2) time compressed speech, and (3) competing speakers, and the outcomes of training were compared between normal and ARHL groups. Pre- and post-test sessions were completed by all participants. Outcome measures included tests on all of the trained conditions as well as on a series of untrained conditions designed to assess the transfer of learning to other speech and non-speech conditions. Results : Significant improvements on all trained conditions were observed in both ARHL and normal-hearing groups over the course of training. Normal hearing participants learned more than participants with ARHL in the speech-in-noise condition, but showed similar patterns of learning in the other conditions. Greater pre- to post-test changes were observed in trained than in untrained listeners on all trained conditions. In addition, the ability of trained listeners from the ARHL group to discriminate minimally different pseudowords in noise also improved with training. Conclusions : ARHL did not preclude auditory perceptual learning but there was little generalization to untrained conditions. We suggest that most training-related changes occurred at higher level task-specific cognitive processes in both groups. However, these were enhanced by high quality perceptual representations in the normal-hearing group. In contrast, some training-related changes have also occurred at the level of phonemic representations in the ARHL group, consistent with an interaction between bottom-up and top-down processes. "

"26840922","Speech recognition in noise under hearing protection: A computational study of the combined effects of hearing loss and hearing protector attenuation.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of hearing protection on speech recognition in noise.DESIGN: Computational study using a speech recognition model that was previously empirically validated.STUDY SAMPLE: Recognition scores were calculated in unprotected and protected conditions for four sets of hearing protector attenuation functions in two different noises, for three simulated hearing profiles illustrative of those anticipated in the noisy workplace.RESULTS: For a normal-hearing profile, recognition scores were not sensitive to the slope of the attenuation function and the overall amount of noise reduction, but protected conditions provided a small but consistent 7-12% benefit compared to unprotected listening. For profiles simulating hearing loss, recognition scores were much more sensitive to the attenuation function. Substantial drops of 30% or more were found compared to unprotected listening in some conditions of steep attenuation slopes and large noise reductions. Attenuation functions modelled from real hearing protectors with nearly-flat attenuation yielded a benefit compared to unprotected listening for all hearing profiles studied. These findings were true in both noises.CONCLUSIONS: Limiting the slope of the hearing protector attenuation function and/or the overall amount of noise reduction is useful and warranted for workers with hearing loss to prevent adverse effects on speech recognition."

The purpose of this study was to verify whether noise from aircraft adversely affects the hearing threshold levels (HTLs) of aircraft maintenance conscripts during their 2years of mandatory military service. This study included 3,000 male aircraft maintenance conscripts who work in the military runway area. We measured and analyzed HTLs at 2-4kHz. The duration of exposure to noise increased with an increase in rank; however, HTLs showed a tendency to decrease. We attributed such contradicting results to the learning effect and adaptation to military service. However, we suspected that sudden deafness in 6 conscripts (0.2%) was due to loud noise in the runway area during military service. The effectiveness of the hearing conservation program for short-term military service personnel could be increased by focusing on preventing sudden deafness and preenlistment baseline audiogram tests."
"26722345","Prevention of the Evolution of Workers' Hearing Loss from Noise-Induced Hearing Loss in Noisy Environments through a Hearing Conservation Program.","Introduction Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a serious problem for workers and therefore for businesses. The hearing conservation program (HCP) is a set of coordinated measures to prevent the development or evolution of occupational hearing loss, which involves a continuous and dynamic process of implementation of hearing conservation routines through anticipation, recognition, evaluation, and subsequent control of the occurrence of existing environmental risks or of those that may exist in the workplace and lead to workers' hearing damage. Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the HCP in preventing further hearing loss in workers with audiograms suggestive of NIHL. The audiometric tests and medical records of 28 furniture company workers exposed to noise were reviewed and monitored for 2 years. Methods This retrospective, cross-sectional study examined five audiometric tests in the medical records (on admission and every semester) of 28 workers in a furniture company (totaling 140 audiometric exams) following the introduction of the HCP. Results Data analysis showed no differences between the audiometric tests conducted on admission and those performed every semester. Conclusions The HCP implemented was effective in preventing the worsening of hearing loss in workers already with NIHL when exposed to occupational noise. Therefore, such a measure could be useful for the employment of workers with hearing loss in job sectors that have noise exposure. "
"26720128","Prevalence of permanent threshold shifts in the United States Air Force hearing conservation program by career field, 2005-2011.","The purpose of this study was to describe changes in hearing, using the permanent threshold shift metric, among United States Air Force servicemembers, including active duty, Reserve and Air National Guard components, for demographics, job categories, and career fields. In the United States Air Force, only servicemembers who are occupationally exposed routinely to hazardous noise are monitored. Audiogram records and demographic variables were analyzed for servicemembers from 2005-2011 using data from the Department of Defense system that captures occupational hearing tests worldwide. Results suggest that occupational hearing loss was larger in males than females, in officers than enlisted populations, and in Reserve and Air National Guard than in active duty. Compared to similar civilian career fields, active duty has lower prevalence rates for occupational hearing loss overall, although Reserve and Air National Guard prevalence rates were more similar to the civilian reported rates. The proportion of personnel with permanent threshold shifts varied between 4.6-16.7% within active duty career fields, which includes 76% of the population for study timeframe. Permanent threshold shift was larger in small job categories, and in jobs that are not considered exposed to hazardous noise routinely which is comparative with results from civilian data analysis of occupational hearing loss. Further investigation into testing practices for Air Force specific groups, use of the system for nonoccupational hearing testing, and challenges to follow-up compliance is warranted. Increased surveillance procedures for occupational hearing loss are needed to address concerns on the prevalence of servicemember hearing loss, the role of recreational and lifestyle factors to contribute the high reported hearing loss prevalence of veterans compared to nonveterans.

"29461742","Speech-in-noise testing as a marker for noise-induced hearing loss and tinnitus.","Speech-in-noise testing as a marker for noise-induced hearing loss and tinnitus. Noise-induced hearing loss and tinnitus are auditory complaints that often co-occur. Often, there is no immediate indication of changes in the pure tone audiogram. Patients can still have clinically normal hearing thresholds while clearly experiencing reduced speech comprehension. This might be explained by the process of neurodegeneration of the innervated dendrites of the auditory nerve fibres and secondary degeneration of spiral ganglion neurons. Subsequent maladaptive neuronal plasticity of the central auditory system can induce tinnitus. Standard hearing testing is no longer sufficient in these patients. Therefore more complex tasks, such as speech-in-noise tests, might be valuable extensions to the standard hearing tests. We carried out a prospective investigation of the influence of tinnitus upon speech comprehension in noise and the effectiveness of speech-in-noise testing, using the Flemish version of the digit triplet test (DTT). Thirty-seven patients with mild noise-induced hearing loss, tinnitus complaints and clinically normal pure tone thresholds completed the DTT and filled in two tinnitus enquiries. A statistically significant (p=0.026) correlation between the averaged high PTA, 2,z and the averaged SRT across ears on the DTT was found. There also seems to be a slight influence of tinnitus onset on the SRT score."

Results of a 10-Year Longitudinal Study of Workers Exposed to Occupational Noise.","AIMS: To survey current, Danish industrial noise levels and the use of hearing protection devices (HPD) over a 10-year period and to characterise the association between occupational noise and hearing threshold shift in the same period. Furthermore, the risk of hearing loss among the baseline and the follow-up populations according to first year of occupational noise exposure is evaluated.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2001-2003, we conducted a baseline survey of noise- and hearing-related disorders in 11 industries with suspected high noise levels. In 2009-2010, we were able to follow up on 271 out of the 554 baseline workers (49%). Mean noise levels per industry and self-reported HPD use are described at baseline and follow-up. The association between cumulative occupational noise exposure and hearing threshold shift over the 10-year period was assessed using linear regression, and the risk of hearing loss according to year of first occupational noise exposure was evaluated with logistic regression.RESULTS: Over the 10-year period, mean noise levels declined from 83.9 dB(A) to 82.8 dB(A), and for workers exposed &gt;85 dB(A), the use of HPD increased from 70.1 to 76.1%. We found a weak, statistically insignificant, inverse association between higher ambient cumulative noise exposure and poorer hearing (-0.10<U+2009>dB hearing threshold shift per dB-year (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.36; 0.16)). The risk of hearing loss seemed to increase with earlier first year of noise exposure, but odds ratios were only statistically significant among baseline participants with first exposure before the 1980s (odds ratio: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.11; 3.22).CONCLUSIONS: We observed declining industrial noise levels, increased use of HPD and no significant impact on hearing thresholds from current ambient industrial noise levels, which indicated a successful implementation of Danish hearing conservation programs."
"29191772","Gap-induced reductions of evoked potentials in the auditory cortex: A possible objective marker for the presence of tinnitus in animals.","Animal models of tinnitus are essential for determining the underlying mechanisms and testing pharmacotherapies. However, there is doubt over the validity of current behavioural methods for detecting tinnitus. Here, we applied a stimulus paradigm widely used in a behavioural test (gap-induced inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex GPIAS) whilst recording from the auditory cortex, and showed neural response changes that mirror those found in the behavioural tests. We implanted guinea pigs (GPs) with electrocorticographic (ECoG) arrays and recorded baseline auditory cortical responses to a startling stimulus. When a gap was inserted in otherwise continuous background noise prior to the startling stimulus, there was a clear reduction in the subsequent evoked response (termed gap-induced reductions in evoked potentials; GIREP), suggestive of a neural analogue of the GPIAS test. We then unilaterally exposed guinea pigs to narrowband noise (left ear; 8-10<U+202F>kHz; 1<U+202F>h) at one of two different sound levels - either 105<U+202F>dB SPL or 120<U+202F>dB SPL - and recorded the same responses seven-to-ten weeks following the noise exposure. Significant deficits in GIREP were observed for all areas of the auditory cortex (AC) in the 120<U+202F>dB-exposed GPs, but not in the 105<U+202F>dB-exposed GPs. These deficits could not simply be accounted for by changes in response amplitudes. Furthermore, in the contralateral (right) caudal AC we observed a significant increase in evoked potential amplitudes across narrowband background frequencies in both 105<U+202F>dB and 120<U+202F>dB-exposed GPs. Taken in the context of the large body of literature that has used the behavioural test as a demonstration of the presence of tinnitus, these results are suggestive of objective neural correlates of the presence of noise-induced tinnitus and hyperacusis."

The psychoacoustics approach noise exposure assessment followed by the health risk assessment was carried on at the paediatric dentistry clinic and the dental laboratory in the Prince Philip Dental Hospital of Hong Kong. The A-weighted equivalent sound level, total loudness, and sharpness values were statistically significantly higher for the noise at the laboratory than that at the clinic. The degree of perceived influences and sharpness of noise were found to have the impacts on the dental professionals' working performance and health. Moreover, the risk of having a bad hearing state would a have 26% and 31% higher chance for a unit increment of the short-term and long-term impact scores, respectively. The dental professionals with the service length more than 10 years and the daily working hours of more than eight showed the highest risk to their hearing state. The worse the hearing state was, the worse the health state was found for the dental professionals. Also, the risk of dissatisfaction would be increased by 4.41 and 1.22 times for those who worked at the laboratory and a unit increment of the long-term impact score. The constructed health risk mode with the scientific and statistical evidence is hence important for the future noise management of environmental improvement."

"28878660","Long-Term Progression of Sensorineural Hearing Loss and Tinnitus after Combined Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy and Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma: A Case Report.","Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is a common adverse effect for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients treated with chemoradiotherapy. We report a case of 12-year follow-up from a patient with stage IIB NPC, treated in 2004 with intensity-modulated radiotherapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Pure-tone audiograms were conducted before treatment and at two other points in the 12-year period after treatment. Analysis of the patient's audiograms reveals that the development of high-frequency SNHL started after treatment and reached a plateau accompanied by tinnitus approximately 32 months after treatment conclusion. After the plateau, high-frequency SNHL continued to develop slowly in the next 10 years, possibly a long-term effect from radiation-induced microvascular change of the hearing apparatus. The continuous high-frequency hearing decline is associated with increased tinnitus pitch in the patient. With experience learned from this case, we recommend hearing tests at regular intervals for at least 3-5 years for NPC patients treated with chemoradiotherapy. Patients need to be educated about tinnitus and counseling can be offered when they begin to feel inconvenienced by tinnitus. These patients also need to be advised against exposure to noise that can aggravate the already compromised hearing apparatus, leading to further hearing loss and worsening tinnitus. Limiting the peak dose and total cumulative dose of cisplatin should be considered based on the patients' risk factors to achieve a balance between treatment efficacy and long-term adverse effects."

"28615542","Headphone listening habits and hearing thresholds in swedish adolescents.","INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate self-reported hearing and portable music listening habits, measured hearing function and music exposure levels in Swedish adolescents. The study was divided into two parts.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The first part included 280 adolescents, who were 17 years of age and focused on self-reported data on subjective hearing problems and listening habits regarding portable music players. From this group, 50 adolescents volunteered to participate in Part II of the study, which focused on audiological measurements and measured listening volume.RESULTS: The results indicated that longer lifetime exposure in years and increased listening frequency were associated with poorer hearing thresholds and more self-reported hearing problems. A tendency was found for listening to louder volumes and poorer hearing thresholds. Women reported more subjective hearing problems compared with men but exhibited better hearing thresholds. In contrast, men reported more use of personal music devices, and they listen at higher volumes.DISCUSSION: Additionally, the study shows that adolescents listening for =3<U+2009>h at every occasion more likely had tinnitus. Those listening at =85<U+2009>dB<U+2009>LAeq, FF and listening every day exhibited poorer mean hearing thresholds, reported more subjective hearing problems and listened more frequently in school and while sleeping.CONCLUSION: Although the vast majority listened at moderate sound levels and for shorter periods of time, the study also indicates that there is a subgroup (10%) that listens between 90 and 100<U+2009>dB for longer periods of time, even during sleep. This group might be at risk for developing future noise-induced hearing impairments."
"28601814","Hearing loss associated with repeated MRI acquisition procedure-related acoustic noise exposure: an occupational cohort study.","OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of repeated exposure to MRI-related acoustic noise during image acquisition procedures (scans) on hearing.METHODS: A retrospective occupational cohort study was performed among workers of an MRI manufacturing facility (n=474). Longitudinal audiometry data from the facility's medical surveillance scheme collected from 1973 to 2010 were analysed by studying the association of cumulative exposure to MRI-related acoustic noise from voluntary (multiple) MRI scans and the hearing threshold of the volunteer.RESULTS: Repeated acoustic noise exposure during volunteer MRI scans was found to be associated with a small exposure-dependent increased rate change of hearing threshold level (dB/year), but the association was only found related to the number of voluntary MRI scans and not to modelled cumulative noise exposure (dB*hour) based on MRI-system type. The increased rate change of hearing threshold level was found to be statistically significant for the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000<U+2009>Hz in the right ear.CONCLUSIONS: From our longitudinal cohort study, it appeared that exposure to noise from voluntarily MRI scans may have resulted in a slight amount of hearing loss. Mandatory use of hearing protection might have prevented more severe hearing loss. Lack of consistency in findings between the left and right ears and between the two exposure measures prohibits definitive conclusions. Further research that addresses the study's methodological limitations is warranted to corroborate our findings."

"28534733","Acute Acoustic Trauma among Soldiers during an Intense Combat.","BACKGROUND: During military actions, soldiers are constantly exposed to various forms of potentially harmful noises. Acute acoustic trauma (AAT) results from an impact, unexpected intense noise =140 dB, which generates a high-energy sound wave that can damage the auditory system.PURPOSE: We sought to characterize AAT injuries among military personnel during operation &quot;Protective Edge,&quot; to analyze the effectiveness of hearing protection devices (HPDs), and to evaluate the benefit of steroid treatment in early-diagnosed AAT injury.RESEARCH DESIGN: We retrospectively identified affected individuals who presented to military medical facilities with solitary or combined AAT injuries within 4 mo following an intense military operation, which was characterized with an abrupt, intensive noise exposure (July-December 2014).STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 186 participants who were referred during and shortly after a military operation with suspected AAT injury.INTERVENTIONS: HPDs, oral steroids.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extracted from charts and audiograms included demographics, AAT severity, worn HPDs, first and last audiograms and treatment (if given). The Student's independent samples t test was used to compare continuous variables. All tests were considered significant if p values were =0.05.RESULTS: A total of 186 participants presented with hearing complaints attributed to AAT: 122, 39, and 25 were in duty service, career personnel, and reservists, with a mean age of 21.1, 29.2, and 30.4 yr, respectively. Of them, 92 (49%) participants had confirmed hearing loss in at least one ear. Hearing impairment was significantly more common in unprotected participants, when compared with protected participants: 62% (74/119) versus 45% (30/67), p &lt; 0.05. Tinnitus was more common in unprotected participants when compared with protected participants (75% versus 49%, p = 0.04), whereas vertigo was an uncommon symptom (5% versus 2.5%, respectively, p &gt; 0.05). In the 21 participants who received steroid treatment for early-diagnosed AAT, bone-conduction hearing thresholds significantly improved in the posttreatment audiograms, when compared with untreated participants (p &lt; 0.01, for 1-4 kHz).CONCLUSIONS: AAT is a common military injury, and should be diagnosed early to minimize associated morbidity. HPDs were proven to be effective in preventing and minimizing AAT hearing sequelae. Steroid treatment was effective in AAT injury, if initiated within 7 days after noise exposure."
"28532971","Clinical and audiological characteristics of 1000Hz audiometric notch patients.","PURPOSE: Among the hearing loss patients, we can confirm that the hearing loss of the specific frequency decreases, such as the 2000Hz notch in otosclerosis and the 4000Hz notch (c5-dip) in noise-induced hearing loss. The 1000Hz notch (c3-dip), however, is rarely studied. We fortuitously encountered a group of patients with a 1kHz hearing loss and report it with a review of the literature.METHODS: Otological history, audiogram, diagnosis, occupation, and history of noise exposure were reviewed from charts and telephone interview, and compared between c3-dip and c5-dip patients (n=98).RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (mean age: 46.2years) demonstrated 1kHz hearing loss; these included 11 males. The pure-tone threshold was 37.97dB at 1kHz and the average threshold was 22.38dB at other frequencies. In the c3-dip group, tinnitus was the most common complaint, while sudden sensorineural hearing loss and idiopathic tinnitus (n=8 each) were the most common diagnoses. Female patients and unilateral cases were more common in the c3-dip than in the c5-dip group, and ear fullness was more common in the c3-dip group than in the c5-dip group. The duration of occupation-related noise exposure was longer in the c5 group, and head or ear trauma was more frequent in the c3-dip group.CONCLUSION: We have defined a new clinical entity of 1kHz hearing loss in patients, defined as the c3-dip, which was clinically and audiologically distinct from the c5-dip. Further study is needed to clarify this new entity of hearing loss."
"28489444","Noise-induced hearing loss: a modern epidemic?","Hearing loss is an increasingly common problem in the UK, and noise-induced hearing loss is the second most common acquired cause. There is a greater burden on the younger population, as recreational noise exposure is an important contributor. New damaging hearing behaviours have emerged including loud music exposure at concerts, nightclubs and via personal music players. The mechanism of damage is thought to involve many diverse pathways, which include oxidative damage, mechanical shearing forces and glutamate excitotoxicity. Although no current treatment exists to reverse the damage caused, these pathways can be targeted by agents that are being trialled for use in post-exposure treatment and prevention, with conflicting results. Other preventative strategies are important in addressing damaging hearing behaviours, including 'safe listening' promotion with advocacy materials for young adults, and promoting safe listening devices."

"28330550","[The type of traumatic sensorineural hearing loss affects diagnostic and medico-legal assessment].","Traumatic sensorineural hearing loss (TSHN) is mostly a high-frequency loss resembling noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). However, approx. 25% of TSHN audiograms differ from NIHL in being of the slope, flat or low-frequency type. The physical properties of the trauma influence the audiogram shape, and the great individual variation of susceptibility to TSHN indicates the importance of genetic factors as well. As TSHN, like NIHL, predominantly is of a metabolic rather than a mechanical nature, its magnitude and configuration may change considerably during the first weeks after the causative incident."
"28273319","Cross-sectional evaluation of an internet-based hearing screening test in an occupational setting.","Objectives The Occupational Earcheck (OEC) is an online internet test to detect high-frequency hearing loss for the purposes of occupational hearing screening. In this study, we evaluated the OEC in an occupational setting in order to assess test sensitivity, specificity, and validity. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2015, in which the optimized OEC was evaluated on 94 employees from the army and three different companies in construction and manufacturing. Subjects underwent OEC in an office-like room. Pure-tone air conduction audiometry was performed as a reference test. The OEC was repeated for a subset of subjects (N=19). Important test characteristics (ie, sensitivity and specificity, test validity, and test-retest reliability) were assessed. Results When analyzed on the individual level, the sensitivity and specificity of OEC were 90% and 77%, respectively. The speech reception threshold results correlated strongly with the pure-tone average of the frequencies 3, 4 and 6 kHz, reflecting good test validity (r=0.79). The difference between test and retest was not significant. The intra-class correlation coefficient was moderate (r=0.57), indicating a reasonable agreement between test and retest. Conclusions The OEC appears to be a suitable test for the detection of high-frequency hearing loss among noise-exposed employees, with good sensitivity and specificity values, even when performed in a semi-controlled occupational setting, though a possible learning effect should be taken into account."
"28249630","Effects of thiocolchicoside, a commonly used myorelaxant, on the acoustic reflex.","OBJECTIVE: To determine whether thiocolchicoside, a commonly used myorelaxant, may impair the acoustic reflex.METHODS: Forty-two patients scheduled to receive thiocolchicoside treatment for different reasons were enrolled in the study. Acoustic reflex thresholds at 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz were determined and analysed statistically pre-treatment and on the 5th day of treatment.RESULTS: Increases were observed in the mean acoustic reflex thresholds on the 5th day of treatment compared to pre-treatment, at all frequencies, except right contralateral thresholds at 500 and 2000 Hz. These increases were statistically significant for right ipsilateral thresholds at 2000 and 4000 Hz, left ipsilateral thresholds at 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz, and left contralateral thresholds at 2000 and 4000 Hz (p = 0.05), but not at other frequencies (p &gt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: Muscle relaxant drugs, especially those affecting the central nervous system, may weaken the stapedial muscle so that the ability of noise to cause acoustic trauma may become evident. For this reason, physicians should advise their patients to avoid loud noises when muscle relaxant therapy is prescribed."

"28220907","Exposure to excessive sounds and hearing status in academic classical music students.","OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess hearing of music students in relation to their exposure to excessive sounds.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Standard pure-tone audiometry (PTA) was performed in 168 music students, aged 22.52.5 years. The control group included 67 subjects, non-music students and non-musicians, aged 22.83.3 years. Data on the study subjects' musical experience, instruments in use, time of weekly practice and additional risk factors for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) were identified by means of a questionnaire survey. Sound pressure levels produced by various groups of instruments during solo and group playing were also measured and analyzed. The music students' audiometric hearing threshold levels (HTLs) were compared with the theoretical predictions calculated according to the International Organization for Standardization standard ISO 1999:2013.RESULTS: It was estimated that the music students were exposed for 27.114.3 h/week to sounds at the A-weighted equivalent-continuous sound pressure level of 89.96.0 dB. There were no significant differences in HTLs between the music students and the control group in the frequency range of 4000-8000 Hz. Furthermore, in each group HTLs in the frequency range 1000-8000 Hz did not exceed 20 dB HL in 83% of the examined ears. Nevertheless, high frequency notched audiograms typical of the noise-induced hearing loss were found in 13.4% and 9% of the musicians and non-musicians, respectively. The odds ratio (OR) of notching in the music students increased significantly along with higher sound pressure levels (OR = 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.014-1.13, p &lt; 0.05). The students' HTLs were worse (higher) than those of a highly screened non-noise-exposed population. Moreover, their hearing loss was less severe than that expected from sound exposure for frequencies of 3000 Hz and 4000 Hz, and it was more severe in the case of frequency of 6000 Hz.CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the need for further studies and development of a hearing conservation program for music students.

We present a systematic review of the literature on cases of SNHL in patients diagnosed with vitiligo and studies conducted to investigate audiometric changes in such patients. Data on presentation, diagnosis and medical approach were reviewed. A total of 21 studies and case reports revealed at least 102 cases of SNHL in patients diagnosed with vitiligo. Arguments for a common causative etiology related to melanocyte function were mentioned in most of the literature. Evaluation of hearing function among all patients diagnosed with vitiligo seems to be an accepted approach; it should include audiometry, otoacoustic emissions (OAE) and ABR measurements. Extra precaution to prevent ototoxic or noise-induced hearing loss is strongly recommended. Further research is needed to better understand its pathogenesis."
"28182600","Vital Signs: Noise-Induced Hearing Loss Among Adults - United States 2011-2012.","INTRODUCTION: The 2016 National Academies of Sciences report &quot;Hearing Health Care for Adults: Priorities for Improving Access and Affordability&quot; included a call to action for government agencies to strengthen efforts to collect, analyze, and disseminate population-based data on hearing loss in adults.METHODS: CDC analyzed the most recent available data collected both by questionnaire and audiometric tests of adult participants aged 20-69 years in the 2011-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to determine the presence of audiometric notches indicative of noise-induced hearing loss. Prevalence of both unilateral and bilateral audiometric notches and their association with sociodemographics and self-reported exposure to loud noise were calculated.RESULTS: Nearly one in four adults (24%) had audiometric notches, suggesting a high prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss. The prevalence of notches was higher among males. Almost one in four U.S. adults who reported excellent or good hearing had audiometric notches (5.5% bilateral and 18.0% unilateral). Among participants who reported exposure to loud noise at work, almost one third had a notch.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE: Noise-induced hearing loss is a significant, often unrecognized health problem among U.S. adults. Discussions between patients and personal health care providers about hearing loss symptoms, tests, and ways to protect hearing might help with early diagnosis of hearing loss and provide opportunities to prevent harmful noise exposures. Avoiding prolonged exposure to loud environments and using personal hearing protection devices can prevent noise-induced hearing loss."
"28164934","Epidemiology and Risk Factors for Leisure Noise-Induced Hearing Damage in Flemish Young Adults.","CONTEXT: Young people regularly expose themselves to leisure noise and are at risk for acquiring hearing damage.AIMS: The objective of this study was to compare young adults' hearing status in relation to sociodemographic variables, leisure noise exposure and attitudes and beliefs towards noise.SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A self-administered questionnaire regarding hearing, the amount of leisure noise exposure and attitudes towards noise and hearing protection as well as an audiological test battery were completed. Five hundred and seventeen subjects between 18 and 30 years were included.SUBJECT AND METHODS: Hearing was evaluated using conventional audiometry, transient evoked and distortion product otoacoustic emissions. On the basis of their hearing status, participants were categorised into normal hearing, sub-clinical or clinical hearing loss.STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Independent samples t-tests, chi-square tests and multiple regression models were used to evaluate the relation between groups based on hearing status, sociodemographics, leisure noise and attitudes towards noise.RESULTS: Age was significantly related to hearing status. Although, the subjects in this study frequently participated in leisure activities, no significant associations between leisure noise exposure and hearing status could be detected. No relation with subjects' attitudes or the use of hearing protection devices was found.CONCLUSIONS: This study could not demonstrate clinically significant leisure noise-induced hearing damage, which may lead to more non-protective behaviour. However, the effects of leisure noise may become noticeable over a long-term use since age was found to be related with sub-clinical hearing loss. Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effects of noise exposure."
"28111321","Development and validation of the Speech Reception in Noise (SPRINT) Test.","Since 1992, the Speech Recognition in Noise Test, or SPRINT, has been the standard speech-in-noise test for assessing auditory fitness-for-duty of US Army Soldiers with hearing loss. The original SPRINT test consisted of 200 monosyllabic words presented at a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of+9dB in the presence of a six-talker babble noise. Normative data for the test was collected on 319 hearing impaired Soldiers, and a procedure for making recommendations about the disposition of military personnel on the basis of their SPRINT score and their years of experience was developed and implemented as part of US Army policy. In 2013, a new 100-word version of the test was developed that eliminated words that were either too easy or too hard to make meaningful distinctions among hearing impaired listeners. This paper describes the development of the original 200-word SPRINT test, along with a description of the procedure used to reduce the 200-word test to 100 words and the results of a validation study conducted to evaluate how well the shortened 100-word test is able to capture the results from the full 200-word version of the SPRINT."

"28054909","Noise Exposure Questionnaire: A Tool for Quantifying Annual Noise Exposure.","BACKGROUND: Exposure to both occupational and nonoccupational noise is recognized as a risk factor for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Although audiologists routinely inquire regarding history of noise exposure, there are limited tools available for quantifying this history or for identifying those individuals who are at highest risk for NIHL. Identifying those at highest risk would allow hearing conservation activities to be focused on those individuals.PURPOSE: To develop a detailed, task-based questionnaire for quantifying an individual's annual noise exposure (ANE) arising from both occupational and nonoccupational sources (aim 1) and to develop a short screening tool that could be used to identify individuals at high risk of NIHL (aim 2).RESEARCH DESIGN: Review of relevant literature for questionnaire development followed by a cross-sectional descriptive and correlational investigation of the newly developed questionnaire and screening tool.STUDY SAMPLE: One hundred fourteen college freshmen completed the detailed questionnaire for estimating ANE (aim 1) and answered the potential screening questions (aim 2). An additional 59 adults participated in data collection where the accuracy of the screening tool was evaluated (aim 2).DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: In study aim 1, all participants completed the detailed questionnaire and the potential screening questions. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify participant participation in various noisy activities and their associated ANE estimates. In study aim 2, linear regression techniques were used to identify screening questions that could be used to predict a participant's estimated ANE. Clinical decision theory was then used to assess the accuracy with which the screening tool predicted high and low risk of NIHL in a new group of participants.RESULTS: Responses on the detailed questionnaire indicated that our sample of college freshmen reported high rates of participation in a variety of occupational and nonoccupational activities associated with high sound levels. Although participation rates were high, ANE estimates were below highest-risk levels for many participants because the frequency of participation in these activities was low in many cases. These data illustrate how the Noise Exposure Questionnaire (NEQ) could be used to provide detailed and specific information regarding an individual's exposure to noise. The results of aim 2 suggest that the screening tool, the 1-Minute Noise Screen, can be used to identify those participants with high- and low-risk noise exposure, allowing more in-depth assessment of noise exposure history to be targeted at those most at risk.CONCLUSIONS: The NEQ can be used to estimate an individual's ANE and the 1-Minute Noise Screen can be used to identify those participants at highest risk of NIHL. These tools allow audiologists to focus hearing conservation efforts on those individuals who are most in need of those services."
"28045804","Prevalence of Hazardous Occupational Noise Exposure, Hearing Loss, and Hearing Protection Usage Among a Representative Sample of Working Canadians.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of hearing loss (HL), self-reported occupational noise exposure, and hearing protection usage among Canadians.METHODS: In-person household interviews were conducted with 3666 participants, aged 16 to 79 years (1811 males) with 94% completing audiometry and distortion-product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) evaluations. Occupational noise exposure was defined as hazardous when communicating with coworkers at an arm's length distance required speaking in a raised voice.RESULTS: An estimated 42% of respondents reported hazardous occupational noise exposure; 10 years or more was associated with HL regardless of age, sex or education. Absent DPOAEs, tinnitus, and the Wilson audiometric notch were significantly more prevalent in hazardous workplace noise-exposed workers than in nonexposed. When mandatory, 80% reported wearing hearing protection.CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with other industrialized countries, underscoring the need for ongoing awareness of noise-induced occupational HL."

"29470259","Pure-Tone Audiometry With Forward Pressure Level Calibration Leads to Clinically-Relevant Improvements in Test-Retest Reliability.","OBJECTIVES: Clinical pure-tone audiometry is conducted using stimuli delivered through supra-aural headphones or insert earphones. The stimuli are calibrated in an acoustic (average ear) coupler. Deviations in individual-ear acoustics from the coupler acoustics affect test validity, and variations in probe insertion and headphone placement affect both test validity and test-retest reliability. Using an insert earphone designed for otoacoustic emission testing, which contains a microphone and loudspeaker, an individualized in-the-ear calibration can be calculated from the ear-canal sound pressure measured at the microphone. However, the total sound pressure level (SPL) measured at the microphone may be affected by standing-wave nulls at higher frequencies, producing errors in stimulus level of up to 20 dB. An alternative is to calibrate using the forward pressure level (FPL) component, which is derived from the total SPL using a wideband acoustic immittance measurement, and represents the pressure wave incident on the eardrum. The objective of this study is to establish test-retest reliability for FPL calibration of pure-tone audiometry stimuli, compared with in-the-ear and coupler sound pressure calibrations.DESIGN: The authors compared standard audiometry using a modern clinical audiometer with TDH-39P supra-aural headphones calibrated in a coupler to a prototype audiometer with an ER10C earphone calibrated three ways: (1) in-the-ear using the total SPL at the microphone, (2) in-the-ear using the FPL at the microphone, and (3) in a coupler (all three are derived from the same measurement). The test procedure was similar to that commonly used in hearing-conservation programs, using pulsed-tone test frequencies at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 kHz, and an automated modified Hughson-Westlake audiometric procedure. Fifteen adult human participants with normal to mildly-impaired hearing were selected, and one ear from each was tested. Participants completed 10 audiograms on each system, with test-order randomly varied and with headphones and earphones refitted by the tester between tests.RESULTS: Fourteen of 15 ears had standing-wave nulls present between 4 and 8 kHz. The mean intrasubject SD at 6 and 8 kHz was lowest for the FPL calibration, and was comparable with the low-frequency reliability across calibration methods. This decrease in variability translates to statistically-derived significant threshold shift criteria indicating that 15 dB shifts in hearing can be reliably detected at 6 and 8 kHz using FPL-calibrated ER10C earphones, compared with 20 to 25 dB shifts using standard TDH-39P headphones with a coupler calibration.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that reliability is better with insert earphones, especially with in-the-ear FPL calibration, compared with a standard clinical audiometer with supra-aural headphones. However, in-the-ear SPL calibration should not be used due to its sensitivity to standing waves. The improvement in reliability is clinically meaningful, potentially allowing hearing-conservation programs to more confidently determine significant threshold shifts at 6 kHz-a key frequency for the early detection of noise-induced hearing loss."
"29463351","Risk Factors for Hearing Decrement Among U.S. Air Force Aviation-Related Personnel.","INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to analyze historical hearing sensitivity data to determine factors associated with an occupationally significant change in hearing sensitivity in U.S. Air Force aviation-related personnel.METHODS: This study was a longitudinal, retrospective cohort analysis of audiogram records for Air Force aviation-related personnel on active duty during calendar year 2013 without a diagnosis of non-noise-related hearing loss. The outcomes of interest were raw change in hearing sensitivity from initial baseline to 2013 audiogram and initial occurrence of a significant threshold shift (STS) and non-H1 audiogram profile. Potential predictor variables included age and elapsed time in cohort for each audiogram, gender, and Air Force Specialty Code. Random forest analyses conducted on a learning sample were used to identify relevant predictor variables. Mixed effects models were fitted to a separate validation sample to make statistical inferences.RESULTS: The final dataset included 167,253 nonbaseline audiograms on 10,567 participants. Only the interaction between time since baseline audiogram and age was significantly associated with raw change in hearing sensitivity by STS metric. None of the potential predictors were associated with the likelihood for an STS. Time since baseline audiogram, age, and their interaction were significantly associated with the likelihood for a non-HI hearing profile.DISCUSSION: In this study population, age and elapsed time since baseline audiogram were modestly associated with decreased hearing sensitivity and increased likelihood for a non-H1 hearing profile. Aircraft type, as determined from Air Force Specialty Code, was not associated with changes in hearing sensitivity by STS metric.Greenwell BM, Tvaryanas AP, Maupin GM.

"29317248","Cognitive decline and increased hippocampal p-tau expression in mice with hearing loss.","Hearing and cognition are commonly involved in both normal and pathological aging. Current clinical interest lies in whether peripheral hearing loss promotes cognitive decline. In our previous publication, the authors have shown a causal relationship between hearing and cognitive impairments in C57BL/6 mice. Here we extended the follow-up to 12 months to determine the long-term effects of hearing loss on cognition and to observe hippocampal p-tau and lipofuscin. One month old male mice were randomly allocated into two groups, the control (n<U+202F>=<U+202F>12) and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) (n<U+202F>=<U+202F>12). After baseline hearing and cognitive measurements, the mice in the NIHL group were exposed to 110<U+202F>dB SPL white noise for 1<U+202F>h every day for 20 consecutive days. Cognitive function was assessed by radial arm maze and novel object recognition tests. p-Tau was observed by the western blot, immunofluorescence, and immunogold staining. The mice in the NIHL group showed elevated auditory brainstem response thresholds and poorer performances in spatial working and recognition memories than the controls. They exhibited more p-tau and lipofuscin in the hippocampus. The cognitive impact of hearing loss varied with the types of memory. Working memory impairment was reversible, whereas recognition memory impairment was permanent. Our results provide behavioral and histopathological evidence for hearing-related cognitive decline. Early hearing loss is suggested to be one of the important determinants between normal and pathological cognitive aging."
