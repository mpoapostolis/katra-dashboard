"11125978","Audiological problems in patients with tinnitus exposed to noise and vibrations.","Tinnitus is a hearing sensation appearing without available sound fluctuations in the external environment. It is one of the major, constant and earliest symptoms suggesting different pathology of the hearing analyser. It must be considered, though, that it is evidenced also at disturbed functions of other organs and systems of the organism. The aim of the present study is to elucidate the state of the hearing analyser in patients with tinnitus occupationally exposed to noise and vibrations in relation to therapy. The study was performed on 67 miners, aged 34-55, mean age 44.5 years. The workers with subjective tinnitus (29 persons--43% of the studied group) are the object of this investigation. They were subjected to the following tests of the hearing analyser: pure tone audiometry; above-threshold audiometry (Carhardt's adaptation test, Lusher's differential threshold, SISI test, Kietz test. The evidence reveals that the studied group of workers occupationally exposed to noise, vibrations, dust, toxic substances etc. complain predominantly of tinnitus. It is accompanied by vertigo, headache and disturbed balance. Changes in the hearing function are observed; manifested by different degree of hypacusia concerning air and bone conductivity in the pure tone audiometry. The above-threshold tests also evidence deviations suggesting disturbed hearing function. These changes can be explained by mechanical-toxic pathogenic mechanisms leading to cerebral and vestibular dysfunction most probably of vascular-circulatory type manifested by the above stated deviations. The results are the basis for the following conclusions: 1. The anamnestic profile of workers with tinnitus exposed to noise and vibrations shows a prevalent percentage of vertigo, followed by headache and disturbed balance. 2. The otoneurological profile shows changes in the air and bone conductivity manifested by different degree of hypacusia. 3. The evaluation of the above-threshold tests also confirms the evidence of disturbed hearing function. 4. The relevant therapeutical approach has to be elaborated, having in mind the existing suggestion about the mechanical-toxic etiopathogenesis of the developed process of vascular-circulatory type."
"10894416","Influence of age and presbyacusis on DPOAE.","The influence of presbyacusis on distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) was studied on 180 ears of 96 normal-hearing subjects. The subjects' ages were distributed equally and ranged from 14 to 82 years. It was shown that there is a highly significant decrease in DPOAE amplitudes during the ageing process. By means of special statistical procedures, such as partial correlation and multiple regression, it was proved that the main reason for this is deterioration in pure-tone thresholds. However, other age-related effects were determined and were also found to lead to a further decrease in DPOAE amplitudes. The latter might be due to middle ear alterations in elderly people. Knowledge of the influence of presbyacusis on DPOAE is important if DPOAEs are to be used in expert assessment of inner ear disorders, for example, occupational noise-induced hearing loss."
"10857071","[Assessment of hearing impairment in workers exposed to mixtures of organic solvents in the paint and lacquer industry].","Clinical and experimental studies indicate a possible harmful effect of chemicals, especially organic solvents, on the hearing system. In combined exposure to noise and solvents, very common in industry, it is most likely that a synergetic action of these factors enhances the traumatising effect of exposure to noise. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence and the risk of hearing impairment in 117 paint and lacquer factory workers exposed to a mixture of organic solvents. An analysis of organic solvent mixtures reveals that xylene and ethyl acetate are their major components whose concentrations depend on individual workposts. The control group consisted of 76 workers exposed to noise exceeding, Threshold Limit Value and 125 healthy subjects exposed neither to noise nor to solvents in their occupational setting. Pure tone audiometry revealed the highest hearing thresholds in workers exposed to solvents, lower thresholds in those exposed to noise, and the lowest ones in the non-exposed individuals. Hearing loss was found in 30% of workers exposed to organic solvents, in 20% of noise-exposed subjects, and in only 6% of non-exposed subjects. The comparison of relative risk values also indicated significantly enhanced probability of hearing impairment in workers of the paint and lacquer factory (9.6; 3.2-25.6), which is even more strongly pronounced than in the group of subjects exposed to noise (4.2; 1.2-13.2). An analysis of hearing impairment risk in particular frequencies suggests that organic solvents may damage the inner ear in much greater extent than noise. The results of the study show that exposure to organic solvents may create a significant risk of hearing impairment. Therefore, further steps should be taken to include the exposed population into effective preventive programmes."
"10652689","Hearing loss among construction workers in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.","Hearing acuity among electricians, plumbers and pipefitters, and boilermakers with &gt; or = 20 years of union membership was compared with that of telephone workers. Automated pure tone audiometry was performed and a questionnaire was administered. Most construction workers were exposed to occupational noise and wore hearing protection. Median thresholds for electricians and telephone workers were comparable. Thresholds of plumbers and pipefitters were higher but comparable to expected values. Boilermakers had high levels of hearing loss. Thresholds at 4000 Hz among older workers were similar for all groups and were above expected values, suggesting a cohort effect. Audiometric screening seems to be warranted for some construction workers."
"11683452","Hearing development in classical orchestral musicians. A follow-up study.","Using pure tone audiometry in 1995, a hearing reassessment was made in 56 classical musicians who participated in Axelsson &amp; Lindgren's study 16 years earlier, in 1979. This study focuses on hearing development in these classical orchestra musicians, active in Göteborg, Sweden. The aim of the study is to evaluate the risk of progressive hearing loss during work in a classical orchestra. Another aim is to study possible hearing differences in females and males and to compare the high frequency pure-tone average values found in the study with two normal materials. The main findings were that the male, compared to the female musicians, showed a tendency toward a more pronounced, although not significant, hearing reduction in the high frequency region and higher threshold distribution within the 90th percentile than the females. This was found most often in the left ear. The median audiogram for all females showed a notch configuration at 6 kHz, compared to the males who had a high-tone sloping configuration. When comparing high frequency pure-tone average (HFPTA) values with ISO 7029, the females are distributed around the ISO 7029 median and well within the 90th percentile. The average among the males was equal with the median. Comparison with Davis normal population &quot;all the sample, overall occupational group&quot; showed a more even distribution of the HFPTA values around the median for both females and males on both occasions. This follow-up study showed no extended negative progress of the pure-tone hearing threshold values in spite of an additional 16 years of musical noise exposure."

"11257914","Noise-induced hearing loss among textile workers in Lagos metropolis.","A cross-sectional sample of 204 textile workers was selected randomly from all sections (including the non-production areas), and was initially screened to exclude subjects with pathological middle ear as well as those currently working in sections classified as non-noise but who had been exposed to excessive noise in the past. A total of 17 workers were thus excluded leaving 187 who were then assessed by means of air-conduction and bone-conduction audiograms obtained by the use of a manual (medicor-SA 3L), pure-tone audiometer. All audiometric tests were preceded by an otological examination to rule out the presence of any significant aural pathological conditions. The subjects were divided into 3 groups, based on the noise levels observed at their worksites using a Bruel and Kjaer type 2225 (integrating) sound level meter viz: the noise-exposed group (noise levels &gt; 90 dBA); the less-noise-exposed group (noise levels 85-90 dBA); and the non-noise-exposed group (noise levels &lt; 85 dBA). A comparative analysis of the data on hearing threshold levels of the 3 groups showed that the noise-exposed group had significantly (P &lt; 0.05) elevated hearing threshold levels at all frequencies and in each age group, although the maximal threshold shifts were observed at the 4000 Hz frequency. Also, the hearing threshold levels for the noise-exposed group increased with the duration of noise exposure. The study clearly showed the deleterious effects of uncontrolled occupational noise exposure on unprotected workers. A very high prevalence rate of noise-induced hearing loss (79.8%) was recorded for the noise-exposed group. The less-noise-exposed group recorded a comparatively low figure of 11.3%. The weaving section alone recorded the highest prevalence rate of 84.5%, followed very closely by the spinning section with 71.0%. The lowest prevalence rate (2.9%) was recorded for the administrative staff."

Identification of the front of growing loudness was impaired more in persons exposed to lead-containing dust; therefore they have more serious central hearing defects."
"12488935","[Noise-induced hearing loss and high blood pressure among city bus drivers].","OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of occupational noise-induced hearing loss and arterial hypertension among city bus drivers.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out on a probability random sample of 108 city bus drivers taken out of a total of 1,529 estimated professionals in the city of Campinas, Brazil, in 1991. Drivers were interviewed using questionnaires on job history, shift work and vacation schedules and underwent clinical and laboratory examinations including measures of blood pressure, pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry, and anthropometric data analysis after an informed consent was obtained.RESULTS: The prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss was 32.7%. According to Merluzzi's classification, 91.2% (31 cases) were classified as first and second-degree losses and the most affected frequencies were 6 kHz in 61.3%, and 4 kHz in 38.7%. There were no differences in the laterality of the first affected ear. The prevalence of arterial hypertension was 13.2% (PAD &gt; or =90 mmHg; PAS &gt; or =140 mmHg).CONCLUSIONS: The risk of noise-induced hearing loss was greater for drivers in job for more than 6 years, after controlling for age-related hearing loss. An odds ratio of 19.25 was found for those aged 45 or more (1.59&lt;OR&lt;386.75; p&lt;0.01)."

"12227672","Audiometric findings in workers exposed to low levels of styrene and noise.","Audiometry and exposure measurements were conducted on workers from fiberglass and metal products manufacturing plants and a mail distribution terminal (N = 313). Workers exposed to noise and styrene had significantly worse pure-tone thresholds at 2, 3, 4, and 6 kHz when compared with noise-exposed or nonexposed workers. Age, noise exposure, and urinary mandelic acid (a biologic marker for styrene) were the variables that met the significance level criterion in the multiple logistic regression. The odds ratios for hearing loss were 1.19 for each increment of 1 year of age (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.28), 1.18 for every decibel &gt;85 dB(A) of noise exposure (95% CI, 1.01-1.34), and 2.44 for each millimole of mandelic acid per gram of creatinine in urine (95% CI, 1.01-5.89). Our findings suggest that exposure to styrene even below recommended values had a toxic effect on the auditory system."
"12186037","Distribution of risk factors for hearing loss: implications for evaluating risk of occupational noise-induced hearing loss.","This paper presents an analysis of hearing threshold levels among 2066 white male workers employed in various U.S. industries studied in the 1968-72 NIOSH Occupational Noise and Hearing Survey (ONHS). The distribution of hearing threshold levels (HTL) is examined in relation to various risk factors (age, prior occupational noise, medical conditions) for hearing loss among a population of noise exposed and control (low noise-exposed) industrial workers. Previous analyses of a subset of these data from the ONHS focused on 1172 highly &quot;screened&quot; workers. An additional 894 male workers (609 noise-exposed and 285 controls), who were excluded for various reasons (i.e., nonoccupational noise exposure, otologic or medical conditions affecting hearing, prior occupational noise exposure) have been added to examine hearing loss in an unscreened population. Data are analyzed by age, duration of exposure, and sound level (8-h TWA) by individual test frequency. Results indicate that hearing threshold levels are higher among unscreened noise-exposed and control workers relative to screened workers. Analysis of risk factors such as nonoccupational noise exposure, medical conditions, and type of industry among unscreened controls indicated that these factors were not significantly associated with increased mean HTLs or risk of material impairment over and above what is expected due to age. Age-specific mean hearing threshold levels (and percentiles of the distribution) among the unscreened ONHS control population may be used as a comparison population of low-noise exposed white male industrial workers for evaluating the effectiveness of hearing conservation programs for workers less than 55 years of age. To make valid inferences regarding occupational noise-induced hearing loss, it is important to use hearing data from reference (control) populations that are similar with respect to the degree of subject screening, type of work force (blue vs white collar), and the distribution of other risk factors for hearing loss."
"12033636","Hearing threshold levels for an otologically unscreened, non-occupationally noise-exposed population in Sweden.","The aim of this study was to investigate the hearing threshold levels (HTL) of an otologically unscreened population in Sweden. The results are compared to other studies of otologically unscreened populations, and a new mathematical model of hearing threshold levels as a function of age is presented. The subjects were males and females aged from 19 to 81 years, selected from the province of Ostergötland in Sweden. The test battery included otoscopy, tympanometry, pure-tone audiometry, and a questionnaire. Subjects exposed to occupational noise were excluded, and in total 603 persons were included in the analysis. The regression analysis resulted in different hyperbolic tangent functions with four parameters: HTL=A+B x tanh(C x age+D)."
"11936172","Hearing loss and hearing handicap in users of recreational firearms.","This investigation sought to establish the prevalence of hearing loss and hearing handicap in a population of 232 recreational firearm users. Hearing handicap was calculated based on four methods using pure-tone threshold data from the American Academy of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, and American Speech-Language and Hearing Association in addition to the self-report Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults-Screener (HHIA-S). Subjects (45 female and 187 male) ranging in age from 13 to 77 years (mean = 40 years, SD = 15.1) completed a short questionnaire regarding demographics and shooting practices followed by pure-tone air audiometry at Occupational Safety and Health Administration test frequencies of 500 to 6000 Hz. A total of 177 who exhibited varying degrees of hearing loss also received a face-to-face administration of the HHIA-S. Audiometric and HHIA-S results revealed that both high-frequency hearing loss and hearing handicap varied significantly as functions of age and occupation. Significant gender effects were observed audiometrically but not as a function of hearing handicap. HHIA-S scores varied significantly as a function of high-frequency (1000-4000 Hz) hearing loss. Correlation coefficients between the four different pure-tone methods of calculating hearing handicap and the self-reported HHIA-S were highest for pure-tone methods that do not employ 500 Hz in the calculation."
"11915232","Noise attenuation characteristics of a foam type earplug measured using a dummy head.","The attenuation characteristics of the earplug using a dummy head (KEMAR; Knowles Electronics Manikin for Acoustic Research) were measured, when it was exposed to pure tones or broadband noises at three different sound pressure levels (SPLs) of 70, 80 and 90 dB SPL in the 'wide frequency range from 250 to 20 k Hz. We ascertained the satisfactory capacity of noise attenuation except for from 10 k to 14 k Hz. The noise attenuation level increased with frequency until 2 k Hz, became almost constant until 8 k Hz, then decreased at around 10 k to 14 k Hz, and recovered in the range from 16 k to 20 k Hz. The frequency characteristics were identical among three different sound pressure levels and almost identical between pure tones and broadband noises. The change of frequency characteristics affected by the depth of the earplug that was inserted into the artificial ear canal of the KEMAR was also investigated. Measured sound pressure level by the builetin microphone in the KEMAR revealed a region in which the measured sound pressure levels were relatively higher around 10 k Hz. The frequency of the region moved higher when the earplug was inserted more deeply. Therefore it was considered that this phenomenon was related to the resonance frequency of the cylinder-like cavity made between the end section of the earplug and the diaphragm of the built-in microphone."
"14689639","A comparison between middle latency responses and late auditory evoked potentials for approximating frequency-specific hearing levels in medicolegal patients with occupational hearing loss.","To evaluate the medicolegal relevance of middle latency responses for objectively approximating frequency-specific hearing levels in subjects with occupational hearing loss, we compared the middle latency response with the cortical response in 22 reliable subjects who had noise-induced hearing loss and were submitting claims for compensation and 21 subjects who had noise-induced hearing loss but were exaggerating the level of this loss and also were submitting claims for compensation. Middle latency components of auditory evoked potentials, especially the time-saving 40-Hz response, seem efficient and reliable for evaluating the true pure-tone thresholds (1, 2, and 3 kHz). A good correlation exists between the 40-Hz response threshold and the slow vertex response (SVR) threshold (long latency). Both also show a fairly close correlation with behavioral thresholds in cooperating subjects. However, in most cases, the 40-Hz response is less sensitive (mode of difference, 10 dB) than is the SVR. As middle latency response audiometry is not actually a time-saving procedure in comparison with cortical evoked response audiometry and as it seems less sensitive than the SVR for approximating the true threshold, the use of middle latency response audiometry seems best limited to situations in which a control or a confirmation of the SVR is wanted. Further information about the sensitivity of middle latency response to drug effects and to subject wakefulness (specifically, whether the patient is more or less sleepy) is expected."
"14689614","Cortical evoked response audiometry thresholds and neuroleptic, sedative, hypnotic drugs.","Cortical evoked response audiometry is adequate for approximating hearing threshold levels with frequency specificity when the psychoacoustic responses lack reliability and reproducibility (compensation claim). It is well-known that control of wakefulness is essential for the reliability of slow vertex responses (SVR). Therefore, sedative, hypnotic, and neuroleptic drugs are supposed to have possible adverse effects on the detection of SVR. In contrast, brainstem evoked responses (BER) have proved not to be significantly affected by therapeutic doses of these compounds. The purpose of our study was to assess the reliability of SVR-threshold definition in subjects taking neuroleptic, sedative, and hypnotic drugs. Fifteen subjects examined for occupational hearing loss at the Fund for Occupational Diseases in Brussels and regularly taking one or several of these drugs were compared with 27 comparable controls. In each subject the auditory thresholds were defined with both techniques: SVR (1, 2, and 3 kHz) and BER (clicks). A highly significant difference is observed between the two groups: In the group receiving drugs, the SVR threshold for 3 kHz is 12.1 dB (average) higher than the BER threshold, whereas in the group without drugs, the SVR threshold for 3 kHz is 7.77 dB (average) lower than the BER threshold. In the drug group, large interindividual differences are observed. It may be concluded that the use of neuroleptics, sedatives, and hypnotics renders the auditory threshold definition with SVR completely unreliable. In using SVR for medicolegal threshold definition, controlling the 3-kHz threshold with BER always is necessary."

There were complete data from 50 132 subjects above the age of 19. Effects of various risk factors were estimated using multivariate methods.RESULTS: Noise, ear infections and head injury explained 1-6% of the variance (varying with age, sex and frequency range), apart from what could be explained by age alone (30-58%). The strongest effects were from occupational noise and impulse noise (gun blasts) among middle-aged and older men. Only moderate effects of noise could be detected among women. No effects of amplified music or use of personal stereo players could be demonstrated. There were clear effects of recurrent ear infections and head injury.INTERPRETATIONS: With the possible exception of substantial effects of recurrent ear infections and impulse noise, our results give grounds for somewhat more optimism than most previous results about risk factors for hearing loss."

Pure-tone audiometric measurements were performed in a standard silent room. The blood groups of the workers were obtained from the factory files.RESULTS: NIHL was found in 23 (32.0%), 35 (58.3%), 10 (38.5%) and 7 (38.9%) persons with blood groups A, O, B and AB, respectively. NIHL was determined to be significantly more frequent in workers with blood group O.CONCLUSION: We suggest that people with blood group O are more prone to develop NIHL."

This study describes perceived and measured hearing ability among construction laborers and farmers in order to further the Healthy People 2010 goal to reduce noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).METHODS: Construction laborers (n = 147) and farmers (n = 150) had screening audiograms at their workplace and a farm show, respectively. The relationship of the audiograms with a one-item measure of perceived hearing ability was explored using non-parametric statistics.RESULTS: At the 4,000 Hz frequency, indicative of NIHL, a high percentage of both groups exhibited hearing loss greater than 25 dB: laborers 53%, farmers 67%. Perceived hearing ability was significantly worse (P &lt; 0.05) for workers with a measured hearing loss. The sensitivities of perceived hearing loss compared to audiometry ranged from 0.30 to 0.72 suggesting that perceived hearing loss was not a good indicator of actual hearing loss in this sample.CONCLUSIONS: The poor relationship between perceived and actual hearing loss in this study suggests that best practice requires inclusion of audiometric screening as part of a complete hearing loss prevention program. Future development of an improved instrument to measure perceived hearing ability may be useful in assessing this dimension of hearing."
"12941983","[Findings of standard and high-frequency audiometry in workers exposed to occupational noise for long durations].","OBJECTIVES: Changes in hearing thresholds were determined by standard and high-frequency audiometry in subjects exposed to occupational noise for long durations.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Hearing thresholds were measured between 250 and 16000 Hz frequencies by standard and high-frequency audiometry in 64 male workers (mean age 42 years; range 31 to 55 years) of a hydroelectric power plant and in 30 age- and sex-matched controls with no hearing problems. The workers were divided into three groups according to the noise level and into four groups according to the duration of exposure.RESULTS: The mean hearing thresholds of workers showed significant increases in all frequencies from 4000 to 16000 Hz (p&lt;0.005), the most affected frequencies being 4000, 6000, 14000, and 16000 Hz (p&lt;0.0005). Increases in hearing thresholds were significantly correlated with the noise level and duration of exposure to noise (p&lt;0.05).CONCLUSION: The results suggest that high-frequency audiometry should be used together with standard audiometry in the detection and follow-up of individuals who are at potential risks for hearing losses."
"12937701","[Hearing health of workers exposed to noise and insecticides].","OBJECTIVE: To examine the peripheral auditory disorders in a group of workers exposed to organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides, used in vector control campaigns.METHODS: The prevalence study examined a population of 98 individuals who sprayed insecticides in campaigns for the prevention of Dengue, Chagas disease and Yellow fever. The sampling approach was finalistic, and included the workers in a health district of Pernambuco, during the year 2000. A questionnaire was used to collect data on occupational and non-occupational risks, safety measures utilized, family history of auditory problems and health symptoms. Previous noise exposure history was also investigated, since noise can be a confounding factor for hearing loss. Hearing sensitivity and middle ear function were assessed by pure tone audiometry.RESULTS: Among those exposed to insecticides, 63.8% demonstrated a hearing loss. For the group of workers exposed to both noise and insecticides, hearing loss was observed in 66.7% of the cases. The median exposure time necessary to detect high-frequency losses was 3.4 years for workers exposed to both agents and 7.3 years for workers exposed to insecticides only. Hearing thresholds were poorest among workers exposed to both agents. Auditory damage for those with combined exposures to the two factors was more severe than the hearing losses observed among those exposed only to insecticides.CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that exposure to insecticides was associated with peripheral sensorioneural hearing loss and that noise exposure can potentiate the ototoxic effects of insecticides. It is necessary to evaluate this possible association through epidemiological studies."
"12890658","Occupational toluene exposure and auditory function: results from a follow-up study.","The ototoxicity of occupational exposure to toluene below 50 p.p.m. was investigated in a longitudinal study over 5 yr with four repeated examinations starting with 333 male workers from rotogravure printing plants. Past lifetime weighted average exposures (LWAE) to toluene and noise were determined from individual work histories; recent individual exposures were measured 10 times during the study (toluene, active sampling; noise, stationary measurements). The auditory thresholds were measured with pure tone audiometry. The mean LWAE exposures to toluene and noise were 45 +/- 17 p.p.m. plus 82 +/- 7 dB(A) for printers (high toluene intensity) and 10 +/- 7 p.p.m. plus 82 +/- 4 dB(A) for end-processors (low toluene intensity). The mean current exposures to toluene and noise during the study were 26 +/- 20 p.p.m. plus 81 +/- 4 dB(A) for printers and 3 +/- 3 p.p.m. plus 82 +/- 4 dB(A) for end-processors. Repeated measurement analyses (grouping factors: toluene intensity, exposure duration and noise intensity) and logistic regressions did not reveal significant effects of toluene intensity, of exposure duration and of interactions between toluene intensity and noise intensity. The stratification dependent on noise intensity itself [79 +/- 3 versus 84 +/- 1 dB(A)] was significantly associated with the auditory thresholds. Regarding the missing toluene effects, it was concluded that the threshold level for developing a hearing loss as a result of occupational toluene exposure might be above the actual limit of 50 p.p.m."
"12768684","[Application of extended high frequency audiometry in the early diagnosis of noise--induced hearing loss].","OBJECTIVE: To assess the application of 10-20 kHz audiometry in early diagnosis of noise-induced hearing loss and to explore the relationship between hearing loss and subjects' age, the exposure time as well as the noise level.METHODS: One thousand workers with noise exposure history were examined by pure tone audiometry(0.5-20 kHz). One hundred and twenty normal subjects served as the control group.RESULTS: The noise levels at working sites ranged from 95 to 115dB(A). Compared with the control group, noise-exposed subjects showed minor changes in the thresholds from 0.5 to 6 KHz, whereas the thresholds were elevated in the high frequency range of 10-16 kHz (P &lt; 0.001). The incidence of ears without any response to the maximum output at the frequency range of 14 to 20 kHz was much higher (P &lt; 0.01) than that of the control group. In the animals exposed to noise, the thresholds of 10-18 kHz increased with the aging and with increase of working time (6-10 years), but there were no significant differences among subjects exposed to the noises at different levels(P &gt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: In noise-exposed ears, the occurrence of threshold changes in the high frequency range (10 to 20 kHz) is earlier than that in the low frequency range (0.5 to 6 kHz). Aging and working time also affect the 10-20 kHz hearing thresholds. The lack of responses to maximum output and the changes in thresholds in the high frequency range (10-20 kHz) can be used as indices for the diagnosis of early noise-induced hearing loss and for the assessment of the susceptibility of the subject to noise damage."
"12678933","Factors affecting the use of hearing protectors in a population of printing workers.","This study examined the reasons offered by rotogravure printing workers from São Paulo, Brazil, for not consistently using hearing protectors. The study group was comprised of 124 workers exposed to various levels of noise. Data on work history, psychosocial aspects of their job, medical history, present health, stress, occupational and non-occupational exposures to noise or chemicals and lifestyle factors were collected through an interview. The participants underwent pure-tone audiometry and had their noise exposures assessed. Seventy-nine workers of a total of 124 noise-exposed (64%) indicated that they wore hearing protectors, but only 16 (20%) of that subgroup stated that they wore the device all the time when noise-exposed. The variables significantly associated with the decision for not consistently wearing hearing protectors included interference with communication, interference with job performance, comfort issues, and self-perception of hearing condition."
"12641392","Hearing loss induced by noise, ear infections, and head injuries: results from the Nord-Trøndelag Hearing Loss Study.","Pure-tone audiometry was administered to the adult population in Nord-Trøndelag County, Norway, 1995-97. The 51,975 participants also provided questionnaire information about occupational and leisure noise exposure, previous ear infections, and head injury. Values averaged over both ears were calculated for low (250 and 500 Hz), middle (1 and 2 kHz) and high frequencies (3, 4, 6 and 8 kHz). The aim was to estimate the magnitude of hearing loss associated with various types of exposure by age and sex. Noise, ear infections and head injury explained 1-6% of the variance in hearing loss (varying with age, sex, and frequency range), in addition to what could be explained by age alone (30-58%). Only moderate effects of noise could be detected among women. The upper tenth percentile regarding occupational noise among men older than 44 years had on average an 8-9-dB high-frequency loss, adjusted for other predictors. Exposure to impulse noise (hunting, sports shooting) caused a 7-8-dB high-frequency loss in the same group. No significant effects of frequent use of personal stereo players or regular attendance at discotheques or rock concerts could be demonstrated. There were clear effects of recurrent ear infections and head injury."

In the current analysis, an additional 894 white males (609 noise-exposed and 285 controls), who were excluded for various reasons (i.e., nonoccupational noise exposure, otologic or medical conditions affecting hearing, prior occupational noise exposure) have been added 2066) to assess excess risk of noise-induced material impairment in an unscreened population. Data are analyzed by age, duration of exposure, and sound level (8-h TWA) for four different definitions of noise-induced hearing impairment, defined as the binaural pure-tone average (PTA) hearing threshold level greater than 25 dB for the following frequencies: (a) 1-4 kHz (PTA1234), (b) 1-3 kHz (PTA123), (c) 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz (PTA512), and (d) 3, 4, and 6 kHz (PTA346). Results indicate that populations with higher background risks of hearing loss may show lower excess risks attributable to noise relative to highly screened populations. Estimates of lifetime excess risk of hearing impairment were found to be significantly different between screened and unscreened population for noise levels greater than 90 dBA. Predicted age-related risk of material hearing impairment in the ONHS unscreened population was similar to that predicted from Annex B and C of ANSI S3.44 for ages less than 60 years. Results underscore the importance of understanding differential risk patterns for hearing loss and the use of appropriate reference (control) populations when evaluating risk of noise-induced hearing impairment among contemporary industrial populations."
"12592917","Effects of occupational ultrasonic noise exposure on hearing of dental hygienists: a pilot study.","PURPOSE: The purpose of this case-control study was to determine whether long-term ultrasonic noise exposure via the dental office environment is related to dental hygienists' hearing status.METHODS: Registered dental hygienists (N = 698) who live in the Hampton Roads areas of Virginia were mailed a Dental Hygiene Work History Questionnaire to determine who would meet the inclusion criteria and would be willing to participate in the study. Consenting subjects were categorized into one of two groups, according to ultrasonic scaler usage rate, and matched on age. Persons with known hearing loss due to infection, disease, or congenital defect were excluded from the study. The final sample consisted of 20 dental hygienists with a high ultrasonic usage rate and a matched group of 20 dental hygienists who had a low ultrasonic usage rate. Once the groups were formed, a certified audiologist tested subjects' hearing in each ear via the pure-tone audiometer. Audiometric data were analyzed using the analysis of variance for repeated measures procedure to determine if degree of ultrasonic scaler noise exposure in the dental office environment was significantly related to hearing status in these dental hygienists.RESULTS: Results revealed that the right and left ears were not statistically different in the hearing threshold levels, regardless of group status. However, there was a significant difference in the high ultrasonic usage group and the low ultrasonic usage group at the 3000 Hz. No differences were found at the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz.CONCLUSIONS: Based on these outcomes, the ultrasonic scaler is not considered to have a negative effect on the hearing of dental hygienists at 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz, but may be related to hearing loss at 3000 Hz. Ultrasonic noise may in fact be affecting dental hygienists' hearing at 3000 Hz, but loss of hearing observed at the higher frequencies may be attributed to other unidentified factors present in both groups."

The study material comprised 13 types of weapons used by this group of soldiers. During the target practice, the following parameters were measured separately for the right ear and the left ear: equivalent sound pressure level A (LA eq, Te); maximum sound pressure level A (LA F max) and peak sound pressure level C (LC peak). The measurements covered several single shots or a shot series. In addition, a spectroanalysis in 1/3-octave band frequency of 40-50,000 Hz, was conducted. There were following values of measurements in the direct vicinity of the ears: LA eq, Te fell within the range of 106.2-119.5 dB (mean, 112.2 dB) for the right ear and 104.2 dB-118.4 dB (mean, 113.2 dB) for the left ear; LA F max within the range of 124.5-132.3 dB (mean, 128.3 dB) for the right ear and 116.3-135.1 dB (mean, 128.1 dB) for the left ear; LC pcak within the range of 151.8-156.5 dB (mean, 154.8 dB/155 dB) for the right ear and 151.9-156.2 dB (mean, 155.4 dB) for the left ear. In the noise spectrum, components of audible frequencies predominated, 160-300 Hz (mainly for high caliber weapon); 1600-6300 Hz for the right ear and 2500-4000 Hz for the left peak (small caliber weapons); 6300-16,000 and ultrasonic 25,000-50,000 Hz. No significant differences were found in the measurements of the right ear and the left ear."
"12553175","Ototoxic effects of occupational exposure to styrene and co-exposure to styrene and noise.","Ototoxicity of styrene and the synergistic action of styrene and noise have been shown in rats. The respective data in humans are scarce and equivocal. This study evaluated the effects of occupational exposure to styrene and combined exposures to styrene and noise on hearing. The study group, comprised of 290-yacht yard and plastic factory workers, was exposed to a mixture of organic solvents, having styrene as its main compound. The reference group, totaling 223 subjects, included (1) white-collar workers, exposed neither to solvents nor noise and (2) metal factory workers, exposed exclusively to noise. All subjects were assessed by means of a detailed questionnaire and underwent otorhinolaryngological and audiometric examinations. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed almost a 4-fold (or 3.9; 95% CI = 2.4-6.2) increase in the odds of developing hearing loss related to styrene exposure. The factors adjusted for were: age, gender, current occupational exposure to noise, and exposure to noise in the past. In cases of the combined exposures to styrene and noise, the odds ratios were two to three times higher than the respective values for styrene-only and noise-only exposed subjects. The mean hearing thresholds--adjusted for age, gender, and exposure to noise--were significantly higher in the solvent-exposed group than in the unexposed reference group at all frequencies tested. A positive linear relationship existed between an averaged working life exposure to styrene concentration and a hearing threshold at the frequencies of 6 and 8 kHz. This study provides the epidemiological evidence that occupational exposure to styrene is related to an increased risk of hearing loss. Combined exposures to noise and styrene seem to be more ototoxic than exposure to noise alone."
"12541646","[Study on the working noise in BYPC and the effects caused by working noise on the workers' vestibular and auditory function].","OBJECTIVE: In order to observe the kinds and intensity of the working noise of Yansan Petrochemical Co. and the effects caused by the working noise on the workers' vestibular and auditory function.METHOD: The intensity and frequency of the working noise were recorded by exactolnoisemeter in the workshop. One hundred and seventeen workers were tested in routine pure-tone tested method. The SPVN and ABR were tested within fifty-one workers of all.RESULT: The working noise of Yansan Petrochemical Co. belongs to the broad band and steady noise. The intensity of the working noise were during 85.7-104.0 dB(A) and the main frequency were during 1-8 kHz. About 59 percent workers who exposed to the working noise had hearing loss. The most hearing-loss were in the high frequency. The hearing-loss of speech frequency were slight. Workers who have more six years standing have obviously increased hearing-loss than the workers who have less five years standing. There were significant differences the ABR thresholds and wave-interval between the tested and controlled groups. The SPVN and CP were abnormal in more than 17.4 percent workers with hearing loss.CONCLUSION: The working noise of Yansan Petrochemical Co. belongs to the broad band and steady noise. Working noise can lead to workers' hearing loss of certain degrees who exposed in the noise for a long time. Obvious correlation was not defined between the hearing-loss and the abnormal vestibular response group."
"15477283","Predictors of hearing threshold levels and distortion product otoacoustic emissions among noise exposed young adults.","AIM: To examine the relations between noise exposure and other risk factors with hearing function as measured by audiometric thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emissions.METHODS: A total of 456 subjects were studied (393 apprentices in construction trades and 63 graduate students). Hearing and peripheral auditory function were quantified using standard, automated threshold audiometry, tympanometry, and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). The analysis addressed relations of noise exposure history and other risk factors with hearing threshold levels (HTLs) and DPOAEs at the baseline test for the cohort.RESULTS: The cohort had a mean age of 27 (7) years. The construction apprentices reported more noise exposure than students in both their occupational and non-occupational exposure histories. A strong effect of age and years of work in construction was observed at 4, 6, and 8 kHz for both HTLs and DPOAEs. Each year of construction work reported prior to baseline was associated with a 0.7 dB increase in HTL or 0.2 dB decrease DPOAE amplitude. Overall, there was a very similar pattern of effects between the HTLs and DPOAEs.CONCLUSIONS: This analysis shows a relatively good correspondence between the associations of noise exposures and other risk factors with DPOAEs and the associations observed with pure-tone audiometric thresholds in a young adult working population. The results provide further evidence that DPOAEs can be used to assess damage to hearing from a variety of exposures including noise. Clarifying advantages of DPOAEs or HTLs in terms of sensitivity to early manifestations of noise insults, or their utility in predicting future loss in hearing will require longitudinal follow up."
"15457814","Occupational hearing loss: screening with distortion-product otoacoustic emissions.","Hearing assessment of applicants for occupational hearing loss compensation can be a time-consuming process. An accurate screening procedure that is sensitive to occupational hearing loss may have application in many situations. The present study developed distortion-product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) screening criteria to identify subjects likely to meet the Hong Kong requirements for occupational hearing loss compensation, namely a bilateral sensorineural loss &gt; or = 40 dB HL (average of 1000, 2000 and 3000 Hz). The screening criteria of 1500 and/or 2000 Hz, with a signal-to-noise ratio of &gt; 0 or 3 dB, yielded high sensitivity and specificity. DPOAE measures therefore have the potential to accurately indicate possible occupational hearing loss. However, DPOAEs should be used as a screening tool only, as conventional puretone audiometry remains the more comprehensive measure of hearing sensitivity."
"15330390","The accuracy of self-reported high noise exposure level and hearing loss in a working population in Eastern Saudi Arabia.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of questions in identifying subjects occupationally exposed to high noise level and those with hearing loss using noise dosimeter and pure-tone air conduction audiometry as the gold standards.DESIGN: A cross-sectional study involving 259 noise-exposed workers selected randomly from two factories in Eastern Saudi Arabia. Personal noise exposure was determined using a noise dosimeter. The hearing impairment for each subject was assessed using otoscopic examination and audiometry. Each subject completed a comprehensive questionnaire including questions about noise exposure and hearing loss.RESULTS: Eighty five percent of the total workers reported exposure to high noise level, compared to 76% found to be exposed to a high noise level defined as more than 85 dB (A) as determined by noise dosimeter. The prevalence of audiometric hearing loss (threshold average of 25 dB HL or more in any ear) was 32.4% for the low frequency average (0.5, 1 and 2 kHz), 47.9% for the all frequency average (0.5, 1, 2. 4 and 8 kHz) and 65.6% for the high frequency average (4 and 8 kHz). However, the percentage of the subjects who reported hearing loss ranged between 3.9% and 85.3% depending on the question used as indicator of hearing loss. The question &quot;Do you consider the noise level where you are working now high?&quot; was the most sensitive in correctly identifying subjects exposed to a noise level of more than 85 dB (A) (sensitivity = 93.4%) and subjects with hearing loss (sensitivity &gt; 86%) compared with other questions evaluated. However, it overestimated the prevalence rate determined by audiometry.CONCLUSION: We conclude that in industries where facilities for an objective assessment of noise exposure and hearing loss are not available, questions addressing noise exposure and hearing loss might be a useful alternative means for screening subjects exposed to high noise level and those with hearing loss for the purpose of designing and implementing hearing conservation program."

"15285856","Noise exposure in orthopaedic practice: potential health risk.","Noise exposure is one of the major causes of permanent hearing loss in society. Exposure of health service staff to intense levels of noise in the workplace is a potential risk for the development of temporary and permanent hearing loss. In this prospective study, 18 members of the orthopaedic staff underwent hearing assessment by pure tone audiometry and speech discrimination prior to noise exposure at the workplace and immediately following cessation of work. The number of hours of exposure and noise levels in the workplace was also analysed. Only minimal temporary sensorineural threshold shifts were detected post-noise exposure. There was no change in speech discrimination scores and no individuals complained of tinnitus. The number of hours of exposure ranged from 1.5 to 8.5 hours (mean 5.2 hours). Recorded sound levels for instruments ranged from 119.6 dB at source to 73.1 decibels at 3 metres. Although high sound levels are recorded in the orthopaedic operating theatre, the intermittent nature exposure to the intense noise may protect staff against hearing loss, speech discrimination difficulties and tinnitus."

The causes leading to AAT, causative weapons and mode and level of hearing protection were analysed to find out why so many AATs still occur in the FDF. The material consisted of 119 patients of the total 163 AAT patients treated at the Central Military Hospital during the year 2000. In 87.5% of cases, the AATs occurred in unprotected ears. The most common causative weapon was the assault rifle. Most of the AATs occurred during combat training in the field. Immediately after the AAT. 46.7% of conscripts had hearing impairment and 94.2% tinnitus. Hearing loss, tinnitus or both were experienced by 45% of conscripts at the last follow-up. Careful planning of training exercises could probably prevent some but not all AATs."
"15101286","Epidemiology of occupational noise-induced hearing loss (ONIHL) in Poland.","Noise-induced hearing loss is a major health risk worldwide. In Europe about 35 million people are exposed to detrimental noise levels (&gt; 85 dB-A) in industrial plants, and occupational deafness is a leading occupational compensible disease in the all countries; it is an insidious slow process that develops over a period of approximately 10 to 20 years. Accordingly to the latest estimations, more than 650,000 workers (of a total 5 million employed in industry) are put at risk in Poland. Despite progress in engineering approaches for reducing noise in the work environment and in improving hearing conservation programs (both the technical and medical) the ONIHL still remains a common and costly disability. The aim of this study is presentation of the most recent data on the incidence of ONIHL in Poland in the years 1992-2002 considered to be a base for implementing the effective prophylactic activities. The analysed data were derived from the central state register which collects all cases of occupational diseases recognized in the country. The highest incidence was found in such key industrial branches as coal mining, iron and steel, metallurgical and transport equipment; majority of cases were observed in southern and western provinces, mainly in the Silesian district, known from the significant concentration of noisy enterprises. The most affected were those workers aged 50-59 years and exposed to noise for over 20 years. More than 30 new cases of ONIHL were identified in the years 1992-1998 annually per 100,000 employees, and with beginning 1999 the rate was significantly decreased to 10 cases in 2002. One may presume that it results from the set up of national program of hearing preservation introduced in 1999 with obligatory pre-employment and follow-up pure-tone audiometry, as well as with hearing screening by means of the otoacoustic emissions."
"15035560","Modelling the risk of noise-induced hearing loss among military pilots.","Noise is a significant risk factor in aviation, especially in military aviation. Even though our earlier studies have shown that the risk of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) among military pilots is small and the monitoring of their hearing is effective, we still need to develop methods of assessing the risk of NIHL more effectively at both the general and individual levels. In addition, many other risk factors are considered to contribute to the development of hearing impairment. The novel NoiseScan data management system enables assessment of the risk of developing hearing impairment on the basis of known risk factors. This study investigates the risk of hearing impairment among Finnish Air Force pilots using reasonably accurate noise exposure data and other risk factors for hearing impairment. This risk is also compared with that of industrial workers, whose risk followed the ISO 1999 prediction. Hearing among Finnish military pilots turned out to be better than predicted by the ISO 1999 model. The industrial workers had a larger number of risk factors than the pilots. Owing to the small number of risk factors, the hearing of pilots corresponds to approximately the 80th percentile, being 9-13 dB better than the 50th percentile obtained with the industrial population."
"14979949","Noise induced hearing loss in dance music disc jockeys and an examination of sound levels in nightclubs.","Noise exposure, hearing loss and associated otological symptoms have been studied in a group of 23 disc jockeys using a questionnaire and pure tone audiometry. The level of noise exposure in the venues where they work has also been studied using Ametek Mk-3 audio dosimeters. Three members of the study group showed clear evidence of noise-induced hearing loss on audiometry, 70 per cent reported temporary threshold shift after sessions and 74 per cent reported tinnitus. Sound levels of up to 108 dB(A) were recorded in the nightclubs. The average level for a typical session was 96 dB(A) which is above the level at which the provision of ear protection is mandatory for employers in industry. It can be concluded that DJs are at substantial risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss and noise exposure in nightclubs frequently exceeds safe levels."
"16142735","Hearing loss as a risk factor for agricultural injuries.","BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggested that hearing impairment based on self-report might increase the risk of agricultural injuries. However, self-reported hearing measures may be subject to inaccuracy and subjective perception. We assessed the association of agricultural injuries with hearing loss and other hearing characteristics using measured hearing.METHODS: Study subjects were 150 farmers who participated in the Iowa Certified Safe Farm study. Injury information was collected by telephone interviews at 2-5 month intervals from September 1999 to October 2002. Hearing levels were measured annually using the pure tone audiometry from 1998 to 2002. Adjusted rate ratios of injuries were calculated using the multivariate Poisson regression model.RESULTS: Hearing loss in the better ear (RR = 1.62), hearing asymmetry (RR = 1.67), and fair/poor self-reported hearing (RR = 1.96) were significantly associated with the risk of agricultural injuries. It is notable that self-reported hearing might be a stronger predictor of injuries than pure tone audiometry (PTA). Exposure to noise elevated the risk of injuries in those farmers with hearing loss or hearing asymmetry. The occasional use of hearing protection was significantly associated with agricultural injuries.CONCLUSIONS: This study adds substantial evidence that hearing loss acts as a risk for agricultural injuries. Prevention of hearing loss and noise exposure may be important in reducing the burden of agricultural injuries."
"16112827","Distortion-product otoacoustic emission spectra and high-resolution audiometry in noise-induced hearing loss.","Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) elicited by 60dB SPL pure tones at f1 and f2 were collected at 2f1-f2, in 1/10th octave steps, in a sample of 36 ears from 27 patients with noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). They were analyzed in the frequency domain against the outcome of high-resolution pure-tone audiometry, performed with the help of a Békésy sweep-frequency automatic audiometer. The characteristics of DPOAE level plots as a function of frequency (the so-called DP-grams), relative to the DPOAE levels of a control age-matched group, were compared to their alleged counterparts on the audiograms, i.e., the lower and upper frequency boundaries of the interval with hearing loss. Ears with NIHL split into two subgroups, one (n = 25) with a notch in the DP-gram such that its lower boundary matched the lower limit of the audiometric notch (linear regression with a slope of 0.91, r(2) = 0.644, p &lt; 0.001). Likewise, when it existed, its upper boundary matched its upper counterpart on the audiogram (linear regression with a slope of 0.96, r(2) = 0.89, p &lt; 0.001). In this respect, DP-grams performed better than transient-evoked OAE spectra, which exhibited poor correlations with audiogram patterns. The second subgroup (n = 11) exhibited normal DPOAEs at all frequencies despite audiometric losses similar to those of the first subgroup. In all cases, DPOAE levels were poor predictors of the degree of hearing losses. It is hypothesized that NIHL in the second subgroup involves inner hair cells or auditory neurons, instead of outer hair cells in the first subgroup. Provided NIHL affected outer hair cells, DP-grams provided a comparatively accurate predictor of the spectral extent of hearing loss."

Conventional audiometry in the frequency range 0.25-8 kHz and EHF audiometry in the frequency range 9-20 kHz were performed, both on admittance and before discharge. Thirty healthy recruits of similar age and sex were used as controls.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pure-tone threshold changes documented by conventional and EHF audiometry.RESULTS: The most significant differences in pure-tone thresholds on initial testing were found in the frequency range 0.25-11.2 kHz, and especially in the 4-8 kHz region. Reduction in thresholds across most frequencies was observed after treatment, although recovery was partial in most cases.CONCLUSIONS: The EHF audiometry adds no significant additional information to conventional pure-tone audiometry in assessing and monitoring noise-induced hearing loss."
"16100934","Combined effects of noise and mixed solvents exposure on the hearing function among workers in the aviation industry.","This study aims to evaluate the effect of occupational exposure to noise and organic solvents on hearing loss in the aviation industry. The study population comprised 542 male workers, who worked in avionics jobs in Kimhae, Korea, who kept records of work environment evaluations and medical examinations. The Cumulative Exposure Index (CEI) was constructed to assess the lifetime cumulative exposure of the workers, and pure tone audiometry (PTA) data of the workers from their biannual medical surveillance was used to assess hearing loss. The prevalence of hearing loss found in the group exposed to noise and mixed solvents simultaneously (54.9%) was higher than those in the other groups (6.0% in the unexposed, 17.1% in the noise-only, and 27.8 % in the exposed to only a solvents mixture). The relative risks, adjusted for age, were estimated to be 4.3 (95 % CI 1.7-10.8) for the noise-only group, 8.1 (95% CI 2.0-32.5) for the noise and solvents group, and 2.6 (95 % CI 0.6-10.3) for the solvents-mixture group. These suggest that chronic exposure to mixed solvents had a toxic effect on the auditory system. This raises the issue of whether hearing conservation regulations should be applied to all workers exposed to solvents."

Computer-controlled pure-tone audiometry was administered to the adult population in Nord-Trøndelag County, Norway, during 1995-1997. The 51975 participants also provided questionnaire information about occupational and leisure noise exposure, previous ear infections, and head injury. While screening had little effect on the median hearing threshold levels of young adults, there was a substantial effect when screening men above 40 years of age for a history of noise exposure. Screening for known ear-related disorders and diseases resulted in small effects on the mean hearing threshold levels The median hearing thresholds of both the screened and the unscreened sample exceeded the age and sex specific thresholds specified by the ISO 7029."
"15937413","Hearing levels of firefighters: risk of occupational noise-induced hearing loss assessed by cross-sectional and longitudinal data.","OBJECTIVE: It is well known that firefighters face serious risk to their health and safety in the performance of their duties. To determine whether individuals who work as firefighters sustain occupational noise-induced hearing losses, we evaluated results of hearing tests completed by firefighters and compared them with age-matched, non-occupationally exposed groups of individuals.DESIGN: The results of annual audiometric testing and a related questionnaire collected as part of a company-wide hearing conservation program were obtained from two large urban fire departments. The records from 12,609 tests conducted over an 11-year period were evaluated. Hearing levels obtained from the tests were compared with age-matched control populations from an American national standard, and a longitudinal study comparing the rate of hearing loss to that expected due to presbycusis alone was conducted.RESULTS: Comparisons of the data to the national standard indicated that firefighters do not exhibit excessive loss of hearing compared with age-matched, non-occupationally exposed control subjects. The longitudinal study that examined the regression of firefighters' hearing with age compared with the expected presbycasic regression function indicated that the hearing of firefighters in the study declined over the 7-year period at a rate that was less than that expected due to age alone.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this large-scale, cross-sectional, and longitudinal study indicate that firefighters are not at risk for occupational noise-induced hearing loss, even though they work nonstandard shifts and are occasionally exposed to high levels of noise. The results are consistent with the findings but not the conclusions of several other studies of firefighters' hearing."
"15913156","Is there a relevant effect of noise and smoking on hearing? A population-based aging study.","The objectives of the present study were to evaluate both the respective and combined effects of occupational noise exposure and smoking on hearing, taking age into consideration. The evaluation was conducted using 1478 subjects without a history of ear disease out of a population-based sample of 2267 adults, aged 40 79 years. Pure-tone audiometry and a questionnaire were administered. A deleterious effect of noise exposure on hearing was significantly observed in both genders at many frequencies after adjustment for age, income, and education. The smoking habit alone significantly affected hearing deterioration at 4000 Hz in noise-unexposed males. The combined effect of noise and smoking was not interactive but additive. A dose-response effect of smoking on hearing loss was observed in middle-aged males without noise exposure. Smoking and noise exposure were associated with hearing loss respectively.. This result is noteworthy for the preservation of good hearing especially at the beginning of aging."
"21783525","Exacerbation of noise-induced hearing loss by co-exposure to workplace chemicals.","BACKGROUND: : Numerous organic solvents applied in industry, like toluene, styrene, xylene and n-hexane have been demonstrated to impair hearing in animals. However, the effects of exposure to a given organic solvent and the interaction of noise and solvents on hearing in humans are still not fully recognized.STUDY DESIGN: : The study was aimed to assess the effects of occupational exposure to solvents alone or in combination with noise on hearing in 1117 employees of yacht, ship, plastic, shoe, and paint and lacquer industry. These persons were exposed either to the mixture of organic solvents with xylene as the main component, or predominantly to styrene, or to the mixture of n-hexane and toluene. Detailed questionnaire data and pure-tone audiometry were compared with data of the reference group that included white collar workers, exposed neither to solvents nor noise and metal factory workers exposed to noise only. In all statistics, the confounding factors were recognized as gender, age, exposure to noise, and other variables occurring at a different rate in study and reference group.RESULTS: : Odds ratio (OR) of hearing loss related with the particular exposure to chemicals was 2.4 (95%CI 1.59-3.74) in case of solvent mixture, 3.9 (95%CI 2.4-6.2) in case of styrene and 5.3 (95%CI 2.6-10.9) in case of n-hexane and toluene exposure. The odds of developing hearing loss substantially increased in the case of combined exposure to organic solvents and noise as compared to isolated exposure to each of these hazards. The highest OR (over 20-fold) was demonstrated in subgroups of subjects exposed simultaneously to noise and two ototoxic solvents (i.e. styrene and toluene or n-hexane and toluene). The mean hearing thresholds were significantly higher in the solvent-exposed groups than in the reference group. The differences in thresholds were observed at high frequencies in the solvent mixture- and n-hexane + toluene-exposed groups and at all frequencies in the styrene-exposed group. A positive linear relationship existed between exposure to solvents and hearing thresholds at high frequencies.CONCLUSIONS: : The results of the study provide the epidemiological evidence that exposure to organic solvents in humans is associated with an increased risk of hearing loss. The simultaneous exposure to organic solvents and noise seems to enhance the hearing deficit if compared with isolated exposures."

In parallel to these measures, noise exposure and hearing protection device (HPD) use were extensively monitored during construction work tasks. Recreational/non-occupational exposures also were queried and monitored in subgroups of subjects. Trade specific mean exposure L(eq) levels, with and without accounting for the variable use of hearing protection in each trade, were calculated and used to group subjects by trade specific exposure level. Mixed effects models were used to estimate the change in hearing outcomes over time for each exposure group.RESULTS: Small but significant exposure related changes in DPOAEs over time were observed, especially at 4 kHz with stimulus levels (L1) between 50 and 75 dB, with less clear but similar patterns observed at 3 kHz. After controlling for covariates, the high exposure group had annual changes in 4 kHz emissions of about 0.5 dB per year. Pure tone audiometric thresholds displayed only slight trends towards increased threshold levels with increasing exposure groups. Some unexpected results were observed, including an apparent increase in DPOAEs among controls over time, and improvement in behavioural thresholds among controls at 6 kHz only.CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that construction apprentices in their first three years of work, with average noise exposures under 90 dBA, have measurable losses of hearing function. Despite numerous challenges in using DPOAEs for hearing surveillance in an industrial setting, they appear somewhat more sensitive to these early changes than is evident with standard pure tone audiometry."
"15703143","Does the presentation of audiometric test data have a positive effect on the perceptions of workplace noise and noise exposure avoidance?","Research and 'common knowledge' has for many years accepted that education and feedback supplied to individuals during and immediately after workplace health assessments provides valuable information to workers about their health. Further, if more relevant and detailed information could be supplied then awareness and preventative action may increase proportionately. This research carried out with a rural Australian population has shown that preventative action did not increase in proportion to a corresponding increase in the amount and variety of information provided in connection with hearing health status. Two research groups underwent hearing tests, both with pure tone audiometry (PTA) while the second group also underwent otoacoustic emission (OAE) testing. Test results were presented to the subjects at the conclusion of their test session. An analysis of questionnaire responses at six week and twelve months follow up showed that more information did not result in increased preventative action. Barriers seem to exist such that individuals feel that they are not able to effectively act to reduce overall noise exposure. While self-efficacy initially increased, it declined to close to its initial value over the longer period. Other measures such as perceived susceptibility to hearing loss and the benefits of exposure reduction significantly increased and remained at the same increased level after twelve months. So, while overall awareness of noise and the risks of exposure were increased after both types of hearing test there was no increased hearing health benefit due to additional testing and hearing information."
"15699090","Joint effects of smoking, noise exposure and age on hearing loss.","BACKGROUND: Smoking has been shown to have adverse effects on hearing, but it's unclear whether smoking interacts with known causes of hearing loss such as noise exposure and ageing.AIMS: To examine the hypothesis that smoking, noise and age jointly affect hearing acuity.METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out in 535 male adult workers of a metal processing factory. Pure-tone audiometric tests were utilized to assess hearing loss. Noise exposure assessment was based on a job exposure matrix constructed with industrial hygienist scoring and job titles. Each participant answered questionnaires about socio-demographic, life-style, occupational and health-related data. Analysis of the possible underlying biological model was undertaken assessing departures from additivity using measures of the size of the interaction present.RESULTS: Age and occupational noise exposures were, separately, positively associated with hearing loss. For all the factors combined the estimated effect on hearing loss was higher than the sum of the effects from each isolated variable, especially for smoking and noise among those 20-40 years of age, and for smoking and age among those non-exposed to occupational noise.CONCLUSIONS: The synergistic effect of smoking, noise exposure and age on hearing loss, found in this study, is consistent with the biological interaction. Furthermore, it is possible that distinct ototoxic substances in the chemical composition of mainstream smoke may synergistically affect hearing when in combination with noise exposure, which needs to be examined in future studies."
"17184014","[Effect of smoking withdrawal on hearing loss induced by occupational exposure to noise. A preliminary study].","Smoking and occupational exposure to noise are factors with independent predisposition to sensorineural hearing loss. This is a sinergistic and additive effect. Nevertheless, we have observed that withdrawal of smoking stops the progression on hearing loss in occupational groups with an acoustic exposition lesser than 80 dB SPL. Actually, there is not an unique ethiologic hypothesis."

They were divided in two age-matched groups and with tonal audiometric values within the acceptable limits: 37 were exposed to occupational noise and 37 were not exposed.RESULTS: Risk estimates (Odds Ratio) of absent DPOAE was 12 fold higher for the group exposed to occupational noise (CI 95% 3.1-45.9), in the frequencies of 3. 4 and 6 kHz.CONCLUSION: DPOAE may be useful in the identification of physiopathological hearing alterations caused by exposure to occupational noise, even in individuals with tonal audiometric responses within acceptable limits."
"17086083","Audiogram notches in noise-exposed workers.","OBJECTIVES: Diagnostic criteria for noise-induced hearing loss include the audiometric notch, yet no standardized definition exists. This study tested whether objective notch metrics could match the clinical judgments of an expert panel.DESIGN: A panel of occupational physicians, otolaryngologists, and audiologists reviewed audiograms of noise-exposed workers. In a two-sample process, the panel judged whether a notch was present and whether hearing loss had progressed in a notch pattern. Quantitative notch metrics were compared against expert decisions.RESULTS: At least five of six experts agreed about notch identification in 71 and 72% of the cases in the two samples, and agreement about notch progression was 61 and 67%. Notch depth and professional specialty appeared to affect notch judgments. Despite this variability, a notch metric showed excellent agreement with expert notch consensus in each sample (94.7 and 96.6%; kappa = 0.88 and 0.92).CONCLUSIONS: Audiogram notch metrics can agree with expert clinical consensus and assist in the surveillance of noise-exposed workers."
"17050312","Assessment of central auditory processing in a group of workers exposed to solvents.","CONCLUSION: Despite having normal hearing thresholds and speech recognition thresholds, results for central auditory tests were abnormal in a group of workers exposed to solvents. Workers exposed to solvents may have difficulties in everyday listening situations that are not related to a decrement in hearing thresholds. A central auditory processing disorder may underlie these difficulties.OBJECTIVE: To study central auditory processing abilities in a group of workers occupationally exposed to a mix of organic solvents.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten workers exposed to a mix of organic solvents and 10 matched non-exposed workers were studied. The test battery comprised pure-tone audiometry, tympanometry, acoustic reflex measurement, acoustic reflex decay, dichotic digit, pitch pattern sequence, masking level difference, filtered speech, random gap detection and hearing-in-noise tests.RESULTS: All the workers presented normal hearing thresholds and no signs of middle ear abnormalities. Workers exposed to solvents had lower results in comparison with the control group and previously reported normative data, in the majority of the tests."
"17009596","Association of hsp70 polymorphisms with risk of noise-induced hearing loss in Chinese automobile workers.","Severe noise exposure can induce heat shock proteins (Hsps), and exposure to moderate noise has been reported to confer protection against noise-induced damage to hearing. Whether there is any association of genetic variation in both constitutive and inducible hsp70 genes with noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is presently unknown. Using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism, we genotyped 3 polymorphisms (+190A/ B, +1267A/B, and +2437A/B) in the hsp70-1 (rs1043618), hsp70-2 (rs1061581), and hsp70-hom (rs2227956) genes, respectively, and investigated the associations of these polymorphisms with risk of developing NIHL in 194 automobile workers working in a similar noise environment as evaluated by audiological assessment. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the associations with the risk genotypes, and Whap software was used to analyze their haplotypes. Our results showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the genotype and allele distributions of hsp70-1, hsp70-2, and hsp70-hom between the NIHL group and the normal group (P &gt; 0.05) with and without adjustment for age, sex, smoking, history of explosive noise exposure, and cumulative noise exposure. However, haplotype analysis revealed that the Hap5 (ie, haplotype +190A/+1267B/+2437A) and Hap6 (ie, haplotype +190A/+1267B/+2437B) were significantly more frequent in the NIHL group than in the normal group (20/9, P = 0.022, and 7/0, P = 0.005, respectively). Compared with Hap1 (ie, +190A/+1267A/+2437A), Hap5 was associated with a nearly 3-fold increased risk of NIHL (adjusted odds ratio, 2.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-6.27). Seven of the NIHL patients had Hap6, but none of the controls had this haplotype. Our results suggest that some haplotypes of the hsp70 genes may be associated with a higher susceptibility to NIHL."
"16957502","Methodological issues when comparing hearing thresholds of a group with population standards: the case of the ferry engineers.","OBJECTIVES: To discuss appropriate and inappropriate methods for comparing distributions of hearing thresholds of a study group with distributions in population standards and to determine whether the thresholds of Washington State Ferries engineers are different from those of men in the general population, using both frequency-by-frequency comparisons and analysis of audiometric shape.DESIGN: The most recent hearing conservation program audiograms of 321 noise-exposed engineers, ages 35 to 64, were compared with the predictions of Annexes A, B, and C from ANSI S3.44. There was no screening by history or otoscopy; all audiograms were included. 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for the engineers' median thresholds for each ear, for the better ear (defined two ways), and for the binaural average. For Annex B, where 95% CIs are also available, it was possible to calculate z scores for the differences between Annex B and the engineers' better ears. Bulge depth, an audiometric shape statistic, measured curvature between 1 and 6 kHz.RESULTS: Engineers' better-ear median thresholds were worse than those in Annex A but (except at 1 kHz) were as good as or better than those in Annexes B and C, which are more appropriate for comparison to an unscreened noise-exposed group like the engineers. Average bulge depth for the engineers was similar to that of the Annex B standard (no added occupational noise) and was much less than that of audiograms created by using the standard with added occupational noise between 90 and 100 dBA.CONCLUSIONS: Audiograms from groups that have been selected for a particular exposure, but, without regard to severity, can appropriately be compared with population standards, if certain pitfalls are avoided. For unscreened study groups with large age-sex subgroups, a simple method to assess statistical significance, taking into consideration uncertainties in both the study group and the comparison standard, is the calculation of z scores for the proportion of better-ear thresholds above the Annex B median. A less powerful method combines small age-sex subgroups after age correction. Small threshold differences, even if statistically significant, may not be due to genuine differences in hearing sensitivity between study group and standard. Audiometric shape analysis offers an independent dimension of comparison between the study group and audiograms predicted from the ANSI S3.44 standard, with and without occupational noise exposure. Important pitfalls in comparison to population standards include nonrandom selection of study groups, inappropriate choice of population standard, use of the right and left ear thresholds instead of the better-ear threshold for comparison to Annex B, and comparing means with medians. The thresholds of the engineers in this study were similar to published standards for an unscreened population."
"16938968","Auralization study of optimum reverberation times for speech intelligibility for normal and hearing-impaired listeners in classrooms with diffuse sound fields.","Speech-intelligibility tests auralized in a virtual classroom were used to investigate the optimal reverberation times for verbal communication for normal-hearing and hearing-impaired adults. The idealized classroom had simple geometry, uniform surface absorption, and an approximately diffuse sound field. It contained a speech source, a listener at a receiver position, and a noise source located at one of two positions. The relative output levels of the speech and noise sources were varied, along with the surface absorption and the corresponding reverberation time. The binaural impulse responses of the speech and noise sources in each classroom configuration were convolved with Modified Rhyme Test (MRT) and babble-noise signals. The resulting signals were presented to normal-hearing and hearing-impaired adult subjects to identify the configurations that gave the highest speech intelligibilities for the two groups. For both subject groups, when the speech source was closer to the listener than the noise source, the optimal reverberation time was zero. When the noise source was closer to the listener than the speech source, the optimal reverberation time included both zero and nonzero values. The results generally support previous theoretical results."
"16886774","[Prevalence and characterization of hearing loss in workers exposed to industrial noise of the turbogenerated electric plant of a petrochemical industry].","The purpose of the present study was to assess the impact of occupational exposure to noise and its relationship with other factors that can induce hearing loss in the electric plant workers of a petrochemical industry of the west of Venezuela. A cross-sectional study was conducted that included sonometry tests, carried out according to the established methodology by COVENIN rules, and the occupational medical evaluation and liminal tonal audiometrics test in 75 workers. The equivalent noise levels (Leq) was quantified in different workplaces. It was found out that most of the workers are exposed to high noise levels [&gt;85 dB(A)] and during more time than the recommended. All workers use hearing protectors appropriately. The hearing loss prevalence in workers was 16.0%, there were not noise-induced hearing losses. The hearing threshold registered in the audiometrics test was diminished, but inside the normal threshold values. We diagnosed 12 cases of conductive hearing loss, all grade I; there were not sensorial or mixed hearing losses. There was not a relationship between the equivalent noise level and hearing loss. It is suggested the design and implantation of a program of auditory conservation to protect the health and security of the workers and to conduct a longitudinal study considering the findings of the present study as it basis."
"16882540","Hearing loss in workers exposed to toluene and noise.","In this study we investigated the risk of hearing loss among workers exposed to both toluene and noise. We recruited 58 workers at an adhesive materials manufacturing plant who were exposured to both toluene and noise [78.6-87.1 A-weighted decibels; dB(A)], 58 workers exposed to noise only [83.5-90.1 dB(A)], and 58 administrative clerks [67.9-72.6 dB(A)] at the same company. We interviewed participants to obtain sociodemographic and employment information and performed physical examinations, including pure-tone audiometry tests between 0.5 and 6 kHz. A contracted laboratory certified by the Council of Labor in Taiwan conducted on-site toluene and noise exposure measurements. The prevalence of hearing loss of &gt;or=25 dB in the toluene plus noise group (86.2%) was much greater than that in the noise-only group (44.8%) and the administrative clerks (5.0%) (p&lt;0.001). The prevalence rates were 67.2, 32.8, and 8.3% (p&lt;0.001), respectively, when 0.5 kHz was excluded from the estimation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the toluene plus noise group had an estimated risk for hearing loss&gt;or=25 dB, 10.9 times higher than that of the noise-only group. The risk ratio dropped to 5.8 when 0.5 kHz was excluded from the risk estimation. Hearing impairment was greater for the pure-tone frequency of 1 kHz than for that of 2 kHz. However, the mean hearing threshold was the poorest for 6 kHz, and the least effect was observed for 2 kHz. Our results suggest that toluene exacerbates hearing loss in a noisy environment, with the main impact on the lower frequencies."

There were two groups: I--composed of 40 soldiers protected during shooting and II--comprised 40 young males which did not shoot (controls). Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions were performed by an ILO 292 Echoport Otodynamics device 3-5 min before shooting and 2 min, 1, 2 and 3 h after shooting.RESULTS: The results showed that post-exposure changes in soldiers who used ear-muffs were not significant.CONCLUSION: The use of hearing protectors is strongly recommended because most of them seem to sufficiently attenuate impulse noise from firearms."
"16825883","Hearing in nonprofessional pop/rock musicians.","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hearing and subjective auditory symptoms in a group of nonprofessional pop/rock musicians who had experienced repeated exposures to intense sound levels during at least 5 yr of musical activity.DESIGN: An evaluation of both ears in 42 nonprofessional pop/rock musicians included pure-tone audiometry in the conventional and extended high-frequency range, the measurement of uncomfortable loudness levels, and an assessment of tinnitus and hypersensitivity to sound. Exclusion criteria were (a) the occurrence of acoustic trauma, (b) excessive noise exposure during occupational activities, (c) a history of recurrent otitis media, (d) previous ear surgery, (e) a fracture of the cranium, (f) ingestion of potentially ototoxic drugs, and (g) reported hearing difficulties within the immediate family. These audiometric results were then compared with a control group of 20 otologically normal young adults with no history of long-term noise exposure.RESULTS: After adjusting for age and gender, relative to ISO 7029, the mean hearing threshold in the frequency range of 3 to 8 kHz was 6 dB in the musicians and 1.5 dB in the control group. This difference was statistically significant (Mann-Whitney rank sum test, p &lt; 0.001). A significant difference was also observed between musicians using regular hearing protection during their activities (average 3 to 8 kHz thresholds = 2.4 dB) and musicians who never used such hearing protection (average 3 to 8 kHz thresholds = 8.2 dB), after adjusting for age and gender (Mann-Whitney rank sum test, p = 0.006). Eleven of the musicians (26%) were found to be hypersensitive to sound, and seven (17%) presented with tinnitus. Tinnitus assessment, however, did not reveal any clinically significant psychological distress in these individuals.CONCLUSIONS: Tinnitus and hypersensitivity to sound were observed in a significant minority within a group of nonprofessional pop/rock musicians who had experienced repeated exposure to intense sound levels over at least 5 yr but with minimal impact on their lives. Moreover, hearing loss was minimal in the subjects who always used ear protection, being only 0.9 dB higher than the control group. In contrast, hearing loss was significantly more pronounced, at 6.7 dB higher than the control group, in those musicians who never used ear protection. Continued education about the risk to hearing and the benefits of the persistent use of ear protection is warranted for musicians who are exposed frequently to intense sound levels."

Pure-tone audiometry was administered to an adult general population sample with 51 975 subjects who also provided questionnaire information about noise exposure and other risk factors. Threshold shifts induced by life-long occupational noise and impulse noise (mostly shooting) were estimated separately in six age and sex groups for eight frequencies. Reported noise exposure, as well as observed threshold shifts, were moderate among women. Threshold shifts averaged over both ears among subjects in the higher 2% of exposure to occupational noise, reached 13 dB (3000 Hz, age 65 years + ) among men and were generally largest at 3000-4000 Hz. The shifts induced by impulse noise reached approximately 8 dB among men 45-64 years and men 65 years+. The effects of impulse noise were strongest at 3000-8000 Hz and varied little within this frequency range."
"16716004","Field study to explore possible effects of styrene on auditory function in exposed workers.","OBJECTIVES: We conducted this study to examine, whether occupational styrene exposures are associated with reduced hearing ability.METHODS: The auditory function was investigated by pure tone audiometry and registration of transitory evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) in 32 workers of a fibre-reinforced plastic boat building factory. Sixteen subjects were laminators (mean age: 41 yr (SD: 8)) and therefore regularly exposed to styrene with mean duration of exposure to styrene of 7.5 yr (SD 5.0). The tests were applied to a reference group of 16 workers (mean age: 39 yr (SD: 8)) who were not directly exposed to styrene but had a similar noise exposure.RESULTS: A few and isolated correlations between the parameters of hearing acuity and exposure indices, such as current internal styrene exposures (sum of MA and PGA) and duration of styrene exposure, were statistically significant, but no consistent association was found.CONCLUSION: The results of this study do not support the assumption of an ototoxic effect of chronic styrene exposure in workers."

Information regarding, socio-demographics, present and past medical history of hearing problems, use of ototoxic drugs, hobbies, and smoking habit was obtained using a self administered questionnaire.RESULTS: The levels of noise at workplace have also been measured. Electro production workers were exposed to high levels of noise. Statistical analysis has shown that 44% of electro production workers had sensorineural hearing loss located mainly at 4000 Hz. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that occupational exposure to noise appears to be the strongest predictor (odds ratio, OR: 7.51) of NIHL followed by aging (OR: 5.34), and last by smoking (OR: 2.47).CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that electro production workers are occupationally exposed to high levels of noise, and present high rates of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The observed hearing loss was located mainly at 4000 Hz. These findings underline the need for interventions to reduce the risk for the development of NIHL among electro production workers."
"16702119","Hearing loss in migrant agricultural workers.","BACKGROUND: Farmers have high rates of hearing loss, yet little is known about the hearing status of migrant agricultural workers. We performed a cross-sectional survey to assess the prevalence and impact of hearing loss in this population.METHODS: One hundred fifty migrant and seasonal agricultural workers were surveyed at a series of health fairs held at migrant camps. A bilingual questionnaire included items related to hearing loss risk factors and subjective hearing difficulties. Pure tone audiometry and tympanometry were performed in a mobile testing van.RESULTS: More than half the subjects had some degree of hearing loss at audiometric frequencies between 500 and 6,000 Hz, especially in the higher frequencies. Hispanic males in the sample had significantly greater prevalence of high-frequency hearing loss compared to adults in the national Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES). More than 35% of respondents complained of subjective difficulty hearing or understanding speech, yet no workers reported use of hearing aids. Even after adjusting for measured hearing loss, Hispanic farm workers were more likely than their English- speaking counterparts to complain of difficulty hearing or understanding speech, suggesting that language barriers could worsen the impact of hearing loss. Risk factors for hearing loss included age and abnormal tympanometry. Occupational exposures to noise from tractors and other machinery as well as pesticides were frequently reported, while use of hearing protection was rare.CONCLUSION: Hearing loss is a significant and under-recognized problem in the migrant worker population. Further preventive and treatment efforts are warranted."

The investigation was made as a prospective audiometric study and included 747 men. An age-matched group of 138 individuals served as an unexposed control group, whose incidence of STS was 2.9%. In the exposed group the incidence was 7.9% and the relative risk 2.7 risk ratio (RR). In the subgroup of 95 persons, who already at reporting-for-training had a mild hearing loss, the incidence was 17%. The relative risk for STS in this group compared to the control group was 6.8 (RR), and compared to those with normal hearing at reporting was 3.1 (RR). In spite of hearing conservation efforts, hearing deterioration still occurs, above all in the artillery. Those who already at reporting-for-training had a mild hearing loss were at higher risk for STS compared to those with initially normal hearing."
"16680467","Occupational noise exposure and sensorineural hearing loss among workers of a steel rolling mill.","Hearing loss is one of the most common chronic health conditions and has important implications for the patient's quality of life. However, hearing loss is substantially underestimated and under treated. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of sensorineural hearing loss among the workers in a steel rolling mill in Nigeria. Each of the 150 randomly selected subjects had a structured questionnaire administered to them, followed by a full otological examination. Of these, 116 had tympanometry and pure-tone audiometry. Also a noise mapping of their respective work units was done. The workers were exposed to noise levels varying from 49 to 93 dBA. About 28.2% of the 103 who had their audiogram analysed had mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss in their better ear and 56.8% of them had mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss in their worse ear. The pure-tone average and the average hearing thresholds at 4 kHz for the groups significantly increased with an increasing noise exposure level. The prevalence of sensorineural hearing loss among the study population is high; and noise exposure is at least contributory. Pre-employment and regular audiometry while on the job is highly recommended."

The study aims to contribute to updated normative hearing thresholds for age and gender, while evaluating the effects of noise exposure, medical history, and familial or genetic influences on hearing. This paper presents the unscreened hearing threshold data and prevalence of hearing impairment for different age groups and by gender. Valid audiometric data were collected from 62% (n=50,723) of 82,141 unscreened invited subjects (age-range 20-101 years, mean=50.2 years, SD=17.0 years). Two ambulant audiometric teams each conducted 5 parallel self-administered, pure-tone hearing threshold examinations with the standard test frequencies 0.25-0.5-1-2-3-4-6-8 kHz (manual procedure when needed). Tracking audiometers were used in dismountable booths with in-booth noise levels well within ISO criteria, except being at the criterion around 200 Hz. The data were electronically transferred to a personal computer. Test-retest correlations for 99 randomly drawn subjects examined twice were high. The mean thresholds recorded were some dB elevated from &quot;audiometric zero&quot; even for age group 20-24 years. As also found in other studies, this might indicate too restrictive audiometric reference thresholds. Males had slightly better hearing &lt; or =0.5 kHz for all age groups. Mean thresholds were poorer in males &gt; or = 30 years from &gt; or =2 kHz, with maximal gender differences of approximately 20 dB at 3-4 kHz for subjects aged 55-74 years. Weighted prevalence data averaged over 0.5-1-2-4 kHz showed hearing impairment &gt;25 dB hearing threshold level of 18.8% (better ear) and 27.2% (worse ear) for the total population--for males 22.2% and 32.0%, for females 15.9% and 23.0%, respectively. Mean hearing loss &gt; or =10 dB at 6 kHz registered for both genders even in age groups 20-24 years may be partly due to calibration artefacts, but might possibly also reflect noise-related socio-acusis."

They are continuously exposed to occupational aviation noise and therefore are at risk for chronic neurosensory hypoacusis. Pure tone audiogram registers in them a rise in hearing thresholds throughout the whole band of frequencies studied. This means that aviation maintenance staff is exposed to noise containing highly intensive infrasound and high-frequency components. The detected pathology directly correlated with duration of exposure to noise. Development of neurosensory hypoacusis in aviation maintenance specialists starts earlier than in other specialists exposed to noise."
"18082023","Theoretical predictions and actual hearing threshold levels in workers exposed to ultrasonic noise of impulsive character--a pilot study.","Results of standard pure-tone audiometry (PTA) were collected from 25 workers, mainly females, aged 23-58 years, exposed for 2-13 years to ultrasonic noise emitted by ultrasonic welders. Hearing tests were completed by evaluation of exposure to ultrasonic noise. The subjects' actual audiometric hearing threshold levels (HTLs) were compared with theoretical predictions calculated according to ISO 1999:1990. In 60% of cases sound pressure levels in the 10-40 kHz 1/3-octave bands at workstands exceeded Polish exposure limits for ultrasonic noise. Our comparison of predicted and measured HTLs suggests that the ISO 1999:1990 method, intended for audible noise, might also make it possible to predict reliably permanent hearing loss (in the 2000-6000 Hz frequency range) after exposure to ultrasonic noise. No significant progress of hearing impairment (assessed using PTA) in the operators of ultrasonic welders was noted. Nevertheless, further studies on the hearing status of workers exposed to ultrasonic noise are needed."
"18082021","Central auditory damage induced by solvent exposure.","Different studies have demonstrated that solvents may induce auditory damage. It has been suggested that part of this damage may be localised in central auditory pathways. The present study aimed to investigate possible auditory processing disorders related to solvent exposure. Thirty solvent-exposed workers and 30 gender-, age- and educational level-matched control subjects were selected to participate in the study. To select participants, a questionnaire, otoscopy, pure-tone audiometry and tympanometry were carried out. Filtered speech (FS), random gap detection (RGD) and hearing-in-noise tests (HINT) were conducted in the selected participants. Both groups of workers presented as a mean normal hearing thresholds. However, significant differences between groups were observed for RGD, FS and HINT. It is concluded that a possible auditory processing disorder may be related to solvent exposure."
"18055764","A multinomial model for identifying significant pure-tone threshold shifts.","PURPOSE: Significant threshold differences on retest for pure-tone audiometry are often evaluated by application of ad hoc rules, such as a shift in a pure-tone average or in 2 adjacent frequencies that exceeds a predefined amount. Rules that are so derived do not consider the probability of observing a particular audiogram.METHODS: A general solution for evaluating threshold differences on retest was developed on the basis of multinomial probabilities. The model uses the standard deviation of inter-test differences for 1 frequency as a parameter of the underlying Gaussian distribution of test results. The number of test frequencies, the categories of threshold change, and the probability of each category's occurrence are used to calculate the probability that a given pattern of threshold differences on retest (or 1 rarer) could occur by chance.RESULTS: The multinomial model was compared with 2 other methods for identifying threshold shifts in persons exposed to high sound pressure levels during concerts. The multinomial model identified the same audiograms as the ad hoc methods.CONCLUSION: Tables developed using a multinomial model can provide a clinical tool for evaluating audiograms by identifying statistically significant patterns of test-retest differences in hearing thresholds."
"18034257","Is the audiologic status of professional musicians a reflection of the noise exposure in classical orchestral music?","The sound in classical orchestral music is louder than noise emissions allowed by national rules in industry. We wanted to assess the audiologic status of professional musicians at different ages of their careers and to look for a coherence of declined hearing ability and the sound emissions in order to substantiate advices for hearing protection and occupational medicine in musicians. Data from questionnaires (anamnestic data on sound exposure in profession and leisure times, use of hearing protection, self-evaluation of hearing function and hearing deficits), audiometric data and amplitudes of OAE were evaluated from 109 professional musicians aged 30-69 years from three major German orchestras and from 110 students of an academy of music (aged 11-19 years). Sound emissions of the whole orchestra and of single instruments/instrument groups were measured at the orchestra stages and pits during rehearsals and performances. None of the musicians was engaged in noisy hobbies and only a few used hearing protectors regularly. More than 50% of the musicians had a hearing loss of 15 dB(A) and more. Highest losses were found among the strings and the brass players. DPOAE amplitudes coincidently declined with the duration of performing music in the orchestras. Professional musicians aged older than 60 years had a significantly greater hearing loss at 4 and 6 kHz than those aged 30-39 years. Among the strings in one orchestra a dominant hearing deficit in the left ears was observed. Musicians need the same health care for their hearing as workers in noisy industry. A better education on the hearing hazards (use of hearing protectors) as well as sound protection in the rehearsal rooms is necessary. Hearing loss in professional musicians should be accepted as an occupational disease."
"17999904","[Acoustic trauma in classical music players].","OBJECTIVE: To confirm the existence of acoustic trauma in classical musicians.MATERIAL AND METHOD: Sixty-five volunteers from the Castilla and León Symphony Orchestra were studied. The hearing thresholds of each musician were age-corrected using the ELI and ISO 7029:2000 scales. Furthermore the sound levels of the instruments in this symphony orchestra were studied.RESULTS: We observed that the sound level of the symphony orchestra instruments is higher than the level permitted by law, ie it constitutes a risk for hearing loss. We also found that 4 kHz hearing loss in the 5th percentile among musicians was double the rate that would be expected for age, and that violinists and viola players showed poorer hearing in the left ear.CONCLUSIONS: Classical music causes acoustic trauma in musicians and should be recognized as a professional illness. Musicians are obliged to protect their hearing and to undergo regular check-ups."
"17977289","An assessment of the effect of sound produced in a dental clinic on the hearing of dentists.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of sound produced in a dental clinic on the hearing of dentists in a dental school.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two dentists were evaluated for changes in their hearing thresholds at the Speech and Audiology Department, Manipal College of Allied Health Sciences, Manipal, India. Middle Ear Analyser (MEA), Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA) and Oto-Acoustic Emission (OAE) were used to evaluate changes in the hearing thresholds.RESULTS: There was a change in distortion product (DP) amplitude (temporary shift) in all frequencies. Statistically significant changes were found in the 6 kHz and 4 kHz ranges in the left ear and 6 kHz in the right ear. There was a larger DP shift in the left ear than in the right ear. A comparison of the hearing thresholds of males and females showed a significant difference of 3 kHz in the left ear, where males had a higher hearing loss.CONCLUSION: There were shifts of hearing threshold at 6 kHz and 4 kHz. The danger to hearing from dental clinic working environment in a dental school cannot be underestimated."
"17932017","Central auditory processing effects induced by solvent exposure.","OBJECTIVES: Various studies have demonstrated that organic solvent exposure may induce auditory damage. Studies conducted in workers occupationally exposed to solvents suggest, on the one hand, poorer hearing thresholds than in matched non-exposed workers, and on the other hand, central auditory damage due to solvent exposure. Taking into account the potential auditory damage induced by solvent exposure due to the neurotoxic properties of such substances, the present research aimed at studying the possible auditory processing disorder (APD), and possible hearing difficulties in daily life listening situations that solvent-exposed workers may acquire.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty workers exposed to a mixture of organic solvents (xylene, toluene, methyl ethyl ketone) and 50 non-exposed workers matched by age, gender and education were assessed. Only subjects with no history of ear infections, high blood pressure, kidney failure, metabolic and neurological diseases, or alcoholism were selected. The subjects had either normal hearing or sensorineural hearing loss, and normal tympanometric results. Hearing-in-noise (HINT), dichotic digit (DD), filtered speech (FS), pitch pattern sequence (PPS), and random gap detection (RGD) tests were carried out in the exposed and non-exposed groups. A self-report inventory of each subject's performance in daily life listening situations, the Amsterdam Inventory for Auditory Disability and Handicap, was also administered.RESULTS: Significant threshold differences between exposed and non-exposed workers were found at some of the hearing test frequencies, for both ears. However, exposed workers still presented normal hearing thresholds as a group (equal or better than 20 dB HL). Also, for the HINT, DD, PPS, FS and RGD tests, non-exposed workers obtained better results than exposed workers. Finally, solvent-exposed workers reported significantly more hearing complaints in daily life listening situations than non-exposed workers.CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that subjects exposed to solvents may acquire an APD and thus the sole use of pure-tone audiometry is insufficient to assess hearing in solvent-exposed populations."
"17903578","Vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials in chronic noise-induced hearing loss.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of chronic noise exposure on vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with chronic noise-induced hearing loss, presenting as bilateral notched audiogram at 4 kHz, underwent audiometry, caloric, and vestibular-evoked myogenic potential tests.RESULTS: Caloric and vestibular-evoked myogenic potential tests revealed abnormal responses in nine (45%) and 10 (50%) patients, respectively. However, when both results were considered together, the abnormal rate reached 70% (14 of 20). The hearing threshold of 4 kHz significantly associated with vestibular-evoked myogenic potential results (ie, vestibular-evoked myogenic potential was abnormal in patients with greater degrees of hearing loss), but not with caloric responses.CONCLUSION: Patients with bilateral 4-kHz notched audiogram and hearing threshold of 4 kHz &gt; 40 dB may show abnormal (absent or delayed) vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials, indicating that the vestibular part, especially the sacculocollic reflex pathway, has also been damaged."
"17903577","Hyperlipidemia in noise-induced hearing loss.","OBJECTIVES: To assess the influence of hyperlipidemia on the development of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).STUDY DESIGN: This case-control study analyzed data from the Department of Preventive Medicine at one academic medical center in southern Taiwan.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We collected the laboratory data from routine health examinations administered to workers who were exposed to noise greater than 85 dBA over a one-year period. We analyzed the relationships of cholesterol and triglyceride levels with NIHL.RESULTS: A total of 4071 cases were analyzed. After adjusting for age and gender, hypertriglyceridemia was found to be related to NIHL (aOR = 1.281; 95% CI, 1.088-1.507), but hypercholesterolemia was not (aOR = 0.951; 95% CI, 0.795-1.138).CONCLUSIONS: This study, one of the largest to date to study the relationship between hyperlipidemia and NIHL, found that individuals with hypertriglyceridemia are at greater risk of NIHL. On the basis of this finding, workers exposed to high noise levels should be educated on control of triglyceride levels to help reduce their risk of NIHL."
"17804978","An assessment of threshold shifts in nonprofessional pop/rock musicians using conventional and extended high-frequency audiometry.","The clinical value of extended high-frequency audiometry for the detection of noise-induced hearing loss has not been established conclusively. The purpose of this study was to assess the relative temporary threshold shift (TTS) in two frequency regions (conventional versus extended high frequency). In this exploratory study, pure-tone thresholds from 0.5 to 14 kHz were measured in both ears of 16 nonprofessional pop/rock musicians (mean age, 35 yr; range, 27 to 49 yr), before and after a 90-minute rehearsal session. All had experienced repeated exposures to intense sound levels during at least 5 yr of their musical careers. After the rehearsal, median threshold levels were found to be significantly poorer for frequencies from 0.5 to 8 kHz (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p &lt;or= 0.004) but were unchanged in the extended high-frequency range from 9 to 14 kHz. Decreases in the median threshold values measured before the rehearsal were present across the conventional frequency range, most notably at 6 kHz, but were not observed in the extended high-frequency range. On the basis of these results, extended high-frequency audiometry does not seem advantageous as a means of the early detection of noise-induced hearing loss."

This material presents two simple algorithms to be used to calculate the resulting noise level when composing noise sources. Personal contributions."
"17721363","Otoacoustic emissions in early noise-induced hearing loss.","OBJECTIVE: To follow changes in transient evoked and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs, DPOAEs) as they relate to pure-tone audiometry (PTaud) thresholds during the first 2 years of occupational noise exposure.DESIGN: Prospective controlled.METHODS: Pure-tone audiometry thresholds, TEOAE and DPOAE amplitudes, and contralateral medial olivocochlear reflex strength were repeatedly evaluated during 2 years and compared between and within a cohort of 135 ship engine room recruits and a control group of 100 subjects with no noise exposure.RESULTS: Pure-tone audiometry thresholds for 2,000, 3,000 and 4,000 Hz in both ears were significantly elevated in the study group after 2 years of noise exposure. Significantly lower TEOAE amplitudes were found at 2,000 Hz in the right ear and 2,000 and 4,000 Hz in the left ear. Longitudinal intrasubject analysis of the study group revealed significant reductions of TEOAE amplitudes at 2,000 to 4,000 Hz in both ears and reduced DPOAE amplitudes for 5,957 Hz in the right ear and 3,809, 4,736, and 5,957 Hz in the left ear in the second follow-up evaluation. Baseline medial olivocochlear reflex strength showed no correlation to PTaud thresholds after 2 years of noise exposure. Poor to moderate negative linear correlations (r = -0.07 to -0.37) were found between the DPOAE-averaged amplitudes at 2,979 to 5,957 Hz and PTaud threshold means at 3,000 to 6,000 Hz. Abnormal TEOAE parameters after the first year of noise exposure had high sensitivity (86-88%) and low specificity (33-35%) for the prediction of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) after 2 years.CONCLUSION: The DP-gram is not significantly correlated with PTaud and cannot be used as an objective measure of pure-tone thresholds in early NIHL. Medial olivocochlear reflex strength before the beginning of chronic exposure to occupational noise has no relation to individual vulnerability to NIHL. Although TEOAEs changes after 1 year showed high sensitivity in predicting NIHL after 2 years of exposure, they cannot be recommended as an efficient screening tool due to high false-positive rates."

Study model - a prospective clinical trial.</AbstractText>: Teachers frequently report auditory symptoms and excessive noise in classrooms, but noise level measurements are not done routinely. Study model - a prospective clinical trial.AIM: To study auditory symptoms and audiometric exams of teachers and classroom noise levels.MATERIAL AND METHOD: Data from two groups, GI (40 teachers) and GII (40 voluntaries) were studied as follows: age, gender, working conditions, audiometric exams, and classroom noise levels.RESULTS: In GI there were more females (86%), working in basic teaching (75%), in classes with 21-40 students (70%), with workloads between 26 and 40 hours per week (47%), and variable professional teaching time. Most teachers in GI reported excessive classroom noise (93.5%) and auditory symptoms (65%). In GI, 25% of teachers presented audiometric alterations (versus 10% of controls), with an acoustic notch predominating (11.25%; p&lt;0.05). Noise levels close to 87dBA were recorded in classes at all teaching levels.CONCLUSIONS: occupational hearing loss may occur in teachers. Further studies are needed to confirm this proposition."
"17513895","Audiological findings in workers exposed to styrene alone or in concert with noise.","Audiological testing, interviews and exposure measurements were used to collect data on the health effects of styrene exposures in 313 workers from fiberglass and metal-product manufacturing plants and a mail terminal. The audiological test battery included pure-tone audiometry, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), psychoacoustic modulation transfer function, interrupted speech, speech recognition in noise and cortical response audiometry (CRA). Workers exposed to noise and styrene had significantly poorer pure-tone thresholds in the high-frequency range (3 to 8 kHz) than the controls, noise-exposed workers and those listed in a Swedish age-specific database. Even though abnormalities were noted on DPOAE and CRA testing, the interrupted speech and speech recognition in noise tests were the more sensitive tests for styrene effects. Further research is needed on the underlying mechanisms to understand the effects of styrene and on audiological test batteries to detect changes in populations exposed to solvents."
"17487670","Music exposure and audiological findings in Brazilian disc jockeys (DJs).","The aim of this study was to examine the music exposure and hearing of disc jockeys (DJs). We conducted personal noise dosimetry on 30 DJs and interviewed them regarding their hearing and their job. We conducted pure-tone audiometry, and transient and distortion product otoacoustic emissions before their exposure to music during their work. This first test was preceded by a period of at least 12 hours without exposure to music or noise. We repeated the pure-tone audiometry and otoacoustic emissions after their music exposure, and poorer performances were registered in all retests. The nightclubs' average sound level ranged between 93.2 to 109.7 dB(A). Statistical analysis showed significant bilateral temporary threshold shifts at all frequencies between audiometry performed pre- and post-exposure to amplified music. Transient otoacoustic emissions showed a significant difference in bilateral amplitude and reproducibility at all frequency bands tested. The comparison of distortion product otoacoustic emissions results pre- and post-music exposure showed there was a significant difference in amplitude. Music exposure was associated with temporary and permanent auditory dysfunction among professional DJs."
"17484317","Noise-induced hearing loss caused by gunshot in South Korean military service.","BACKGROUND: Noise-induced hearing loss is a preventive disease and yet the effective treatment modality has not been established. Acute acoustic traumas caused by an exposure to gunshot noise are common in young South Korean males in military service. Considering the significant lack of awareness on this serious issue as well as the absence of proper protective gear, an in-depth analysis is desperately needed.METHOD: All 3650 soldiers performed regular periodic gunfire exercise without any hearing protective measures. Seven patients with hearing impairment after periodic gunfire visited the aeromedical squadron; all were right-handed males. Six were tested with the K-2 rifle and one was tested with a K-5 revolver. History taking, physical examination, pure-tone audiometry, and impedance audiometry were conducted. In the next periodic gunfire exercise, all 3650 soldiers performed gunfire with unilateral hearing protection.RESULTS: The average outcome of postexposure air conduction thresholds was 6.5 dB in the right ear and 33.1 dB in the left ear. After medical treatment, hearing impairment was much improved; however, tinnitus was not diminished. In the next periodic gunfire exercise, the result of a supplement of unilateral earplug protection proved its effectiveness on acoustic trauma caused by gunfire noise.CONCLUSION: Asymmetry in hearing loss is related to the position of the head during gunfire. A unilateral hearing protection device was enough to protect hearing from gunfire noise. At the same time, it can effectively prevent a potential firearm accident that can be caused by trainees mishearing the instruction of a firearm instructor if both earplugs are worn. Thus, providing a unilateral earplug for protection against acoustic trauma must be taken into serious consideration."
"17478967","Effect of exposure to a mixture of solvents and noise on hearing and balance in aircraft maintenance workers.","Aircraft maintenance workers are exposed to a mixture of solvents in the presence of intermittent noise. For this study these workers exposed to solvent mix and noise, were compared with mill workers exposed to noise alone, printed circuit board operatives exposed to solvents alone and those exposed to none who acted as controls. Tympanometry, acoustic reflex thresholds, transient and distortion product otoacoustic emissions, auditory brainstem potentials, nystagmography and posturography were examined. There was a significant effect on pure tone thresholds for both noise and solvents+noise. The distortion product otoacoustic emissions declined with frequency and exhibited lower DP amplitude with noise compared to solvents and noise group. The transient emissions showed a similar effect. Over 32% of subjects with solvent and noise exposure had abnormalities of the auditory brainstem responses in terms of interwave interval prolongation. The mean acoustic reflex thresholds showed a pattern of differences which differentiate noise from solvent and noise groups. The contralateral pathway appears to be differentially affected by solvent exposure. 32% of subjects in the solvents and noise group had an abnormal posturographic finding. In the solvents and noise group 74% had abnormalities of saccades, 56% of pursuit and 45% of optokinetic nystagmus."

The records of environmental noise and solvents measurements and the results of annual audiometry performed by the company were examined. The audiometric results of workers from olefin operational areas 1 and 2 and aromatic plant areas exposed to solvents and noise and utility area workers exposed only to noise were analyzed for the standard threshold shift (STS). Despite the low exposures to solvents and a moderate exposure to noise, 45.3% of workers had hearing losses and 29.6% had STS."
"17478963","Sleep quality in noise exposed Brazilian workers.","This study investigated the effect of chronic workplace exposure to excessive noise on sleep quality. It involved 40 male workers aged 33 to 50 years, 20 of whom had been exposed to environmental workplace noise levels of 85 dB or more on 40-hour-a-week jobs. Another 20 workers who were not exposed to excessive noise were used as controls. All subjects were interviewed and submitted to physical examination, pure tone and speech audiometry, immittance testing and nocturnal polysomnography. Comparative analysis demonstrated that the two groups were similar, except for the exposure to noise. Fisher's test comparison of pure tone and speech audiometry and immittance testing revealed mild to moderate noise-induced hearing loss (P &lt; 0.001) in the &gt; or = 85-dB group. Indicators of sleep continuity were abnormal in both groups, demonstrating poor sleep quality; however, sleep quantity was normal. Of the 40 individuals, 13 (32.5%) presented respiratory sleep disorders. Of those 13, 10 presented daytime somnolence according to the Epworth Scale. The Mann-Whitney test showed that sleep was identical in the two groups. Fisher's exact test revealed no association between altered sleep and hearing status in either group. Our results show that active men working 40-hour-a-week in the presence of excessive noise without adequate protection for more than eight years presented with noise-induced hearing loss but their quality or quantity of night sleep was unaffected. Sensori-neural deafness may represent an element of adaptation against noise during sleep."
"17402219","Individual susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss: choosing an optimal method of retrospective classification of workers into noise-susceptible and noise-resistant groups.","OBJECTIVES: Individual susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) depends on the interaction between intrinsic and environmental factors. To proceed with the study on NIHL susceptibility genes an appropriate selection of workers susceptible and resistant to noise is crucial. The aim of the study was to compare four different methods of subject classification by the susceptibility to NIHL in a group of 949 workers of an electric power plant exposed to steady-state noise at the workplace.MATERIALS AND METHODS: One method based the classification of the workers on the international reference standard ISO 1999:1990; from the entire group of workers, 10% of the subjects with the worst hearing thresholds (HT) in the model were categorized as susceptible to NIHL, whereas 10% of the subjects with the best HT were categorized as resistant to noise. According to three other methods, the entire group of workers was first divided into subgroups by age, duration of employment and the level of noise, and then 10% of the subjects at each HT extreme were selected.RESULTS: The first classification allowed to achieve an excellent separation between HT of the susceptible and resistant subgroups. The susceptible subgroup was significantly younger than the resistant one, showed a shorter duration of employment and a lower level of noise exposure, which is in line with the definition of increased vulnerability to NIHL. The three other methods produced poorer separation of HT with smaller or no gap between HT values in subgroups.CONCLUSIONS: The selection of subjects from the entire worker population of a given industry based on the ISO 1999:1990 standard can be regarded as the most reliable method of classification of noise-susceptible and noise-resistant workers to be used in the future genetic studies on NIHL susceptibility genes."
"17298149","Hearing-impairment among workers in a surface gold mining company in Ghana.","A study to determine the impact of hazardous noise on workers was conducted in a surface gold mining company in Ghana. The procedure adopted included noise survey, case history, otoscopy and conventional pure-tone audiometry. Five main areas were surveyed for hazardous noise namely, Pit, Processing, Ana Laboratory, Bore-hole and Mess area. The results showed that all the above areas except the Mess area produced noise levels above 85 dBA. Again, a total of 252 workers were seen at the company, and out of this number 59(23%) had the classical noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) at 4 KHz. In addition, NIHL increased as a function of age and duration of exposure. It is also noted that out of 81 workers with a preemployment history of noise exposure, 41(51%) had NIHL. NIHL also varied with regard to job location. 14(6%) of the workers had hearing loss greater than 25 dB at the speech frequencies. Thus, factors not under the control of the company may affect the hearing of an employee."
"17259699","Susceptibility to tinnitus revealed at 2 kHz range by bilateral lower DPOAEs in normal hearing subjects with noise exposure.","We investigated potential markers of susceptibility to tinnitus in a group of normal hearing young pilots aged 25-35 years and with 8 +/- 5 years of aircraft noise exposure. 316 pilots were interviewed about their tinnitus status and were tested for hearing thresholds (audiograms) and distortion products otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE-grams). There was no subject with permanent tinnitus. 23% reported having occasionally perceived tinnitus after flight missions and 77% reported never having experienced tinnitus after flight missions. General discomfort in the ears to noise was higher in the occasional tinnitus group (15 vs. 6%). The major finding was that difference of susceptibility to tinnitus in normal hearing subjects exposed to noise on a daily basis seemed to be clearly related to lower DPOAEs, bilaterally, in the 1500- to 2800-kHz range. However, no difference could be observed between groups on audiograms at the 2-kHz frequency range. This study provided evidence of outer hair cell dysfunctions in normal hearing subjects exposed to noise and susceptible to tinnitus. Hypersensitivity to noise and decreased DPOAEs in a non-noise-specific frequency range support the idea of another alteration mechanism than noise itself. This point was discussed in the light of recent publications."
"17228988","Efficacy of a computer-based hearing test and tailored hearing protection intervention.","Advances in computer technology and accessibility enable researchers to provide individually tailored interventions for behavioral change. Using multimedia technology, this study developed and tested a computer-based hearing test and a tailored intervention. The purpose of this study was to evaluate, using a randomized experimental design, the efficacy of the intervention to increase workers' use of hearing protection. The tailored intervention developed by the research team showed more significant short-term effect measured immediately after the intervention than the control intervention. For the long-term effect measured 1 year after the intervention, both tailored and control groups showed significant increase in their reported use (7% vs. 6%) from preintervention to postintervention, but no significant difference between the two groups. The change accomplished in this study was small progress toward the desired level of 100% use of hearing protection to prevent noise-induced hearing loss. This finding showed that changing workers' hearing protection behavior is difficult."
"19052439","Audiological findings in individuals exposed to organic solvents: case studies.","Millions of people around the world are exposed to industrial organic solvents such as toluene and xylene in the manufacturing sectors. Solvents are neurotoxic substances that are detrimental to the functioning of the nervous system, including the central auditory nervous system (CANS). This study investigated hearing and auditory processing in seven individuals with a history of exposure to industrial solvents. A battery of audiological tests was administered to all subjects: pure tone, speech, and impedance audiometry, otoacoustic emissions tests, auditory brainstem responses, middle latency responses, as well as the SCAN-A and R-SPIN tests with low predictability sentence lists. All individuals in this study exhibited findings consistent with retrocochlear and/or central abnormality. Two of the seven subjects in this study had normal pure tone thresholds at all frequencies bilaterally, yet showed abnormal retrocochlear/central results on one or more tests. The auditory test battery approach used in this study appears to be valuable in evaluating the pathological conditions of the CANS in solvent-exposed individuals."
"19050644","Audiological findings among workers from Brazilian small-scale fisheries.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the noise exposure and hearing of fishermen from small-scale fisheries from the state of Paraná in Brazil.DESIGN: Participants of this cross-sectional study included 141 male fishermen, ages ranging from 18 to 77 yr old and 136 controls matched by socioeconomic level, age, and gender. We conducted personal noise dosimetry and interviewed the fishermen regarding their hearing and their job. Audiological testing performed included pure-tone audiometry in the 0.5 to 8 kHz frequency range, extended high-frequency audiometry in the 9 to 16 kHz range, and transient and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions. Testing was preceded by a period of at least 14 hr without exposure to noise. Participants were subdivided in subgroups according to their noise exposure history.RESULTS: Sound level measurement results ranged from 38 to 58 Leq dB (A) in vessels without an engine and between 90 and 108 Leq dB (A) in vessels with an engine. Results from additional area sound level measurements conducted in five different seating locations in the 9HP engine boat ranged from 86 to 105 dB (A). Statistical analysis of the pure-tone audiometry results showed that fishermen with current or a history of occupational noise exposure had significantly poorer thresholds than controls or unexposed fishermen in several of the tested audiometric frequencies. Results of the otoacoustic emissions testing showed differences between exposed and unexposed groups regarding the presence of responses in bilateral amplitude and reproducibility at all frequency bands tested.CONCLUSIONS: Because of the fishermen's increased risk of hearing disorders, a variety of solutions are recommended, which include dissemination of information on control of noise emissions generated by the boat engines, audiological care, and hearing loss prevention services tailored to workers from small-scale fisheries."
"19042192","The effects of toluene plus noise on hearing thresholds: an evaluation based on repeated measurements in the German printing industry.","OBJECTIVES: The ototoxicity of occupational exposure to toluene plus noise was investigated in a longitudinal study in rotogravure printing and existing findings in the literature were evaluated.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprised four repeated examinations during 5 years and started with 333 male workers. Lifetime weighted average exposures (LWAE) to toluene and noise were determined from individual work histories and historic recordings; recent individual exposures were measured 10 times during the study (toluene, active sampling; noise, stationary measurements). Auditory thresholds were measured with pure tone audiometry at 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 kHz.RESULTS: Mean LWAE exposures to toluene and noise were 45+/-17 ppm plus 82+/-7 dB(A) for high toluene exposed and 10+/-7 ppm plus 82+/-4 dB(A) for low toluene exposed subjects, mean current exposures were 26+/-20 ppm plus 81+/-4 dB(A) and 3+/-3 ppm plus 82+/-4 dB(A). Mean exposure duration was 21.3+/-6.5 years for long exposed and 5.9+/-2.2 years for short exposed subjects. Repeated measurement analyses of variance did not reveal effects of toluene intensity, exposure duration and interactions between toluene intensity and noise intensity. Noise intensity [79+/-3 dB(A) vs. 84+/-1 dB(A)] was significant for auditory thresholds. A case concept utilising developments of individual auditory thresholds did not reveal significant toluene effects. Logistic models including age, exposure duration, toluene in ambient air, current noise and either hippuric acid or ortho-cresol (o-cresol) found only age to be significant for elevated OR of high frequency hearing loss.CONCLUSIONS: Due to missing toluene effects, it was concluded that the threshold level for developing hearing loss as a result of occupational exposure to toluene plus noise might be above the current limit of 50 ppm toluene."
"18972126","Hearing status among cabin crew in a Swedish commercial airline company.","PURPOSE: To study hearing loss in commercial airline cabin crew (CC).METHODS: Totally 155 male and 781 female CC (n = 936) in a Swedish airline company underwent repeated audiometric tests during 1974-2005. The last test was used to study hearing loss. The mean test values at 3, 4, 6 kHz were used for the ear with worse hearing loss. Data were compared with a Swedish population (n = 603) who were not occupationally exposed to noise. Equivalent noise levels (Leq) were measured in different aircraft.RESULTS: Leq was 78-84 dB (A), maximum A-weighted exposure was 114 dB. Median values for all ages were close to the reference group. No association was found between years of employment and hearing loss, when adjusting for age and gender by multiple logistic regression analysis.CONCLUSION: Cabin crew are exposed to equivalent noise levels below the current Swedish occupational standard, and have normal age-matched hearing threshold levels."
"18616091","Course of hearing recovery according to frequency in patients with acute acoustic sensorineural hearing loss.","Through pure-tone audiometry, we studied the course of hearing recovery in 24 ears of 20 men (ages 18-48 years) who had acute acoustic sensorineural hearing loss (ASHL). All subjects were members of the Japanese Self-Defense Force. The hearing level in 5 ears returned to normal, the hearing level of 13 ears recovered but was not within the normal range, and the hearing level of 6 ears was unchanged. The time from noise exposure to presentation was longer in patients with unchanged hearing than in other patients. Recovery of hearing was poorest at 4,000 Hz, followed by 8,000 and 2,000 Hz. We concluded that hearing in patients with acute ASHL is likely to return to normal when the hearing level at 4,000 Hz recovers gradually; partial recovery of hearing is expected when the hearing level at 4,000 Hz reaches an early plateau."

A total of 634 male and 30 female pilots (N=664) in a Swedish airline company underwent repeated audiological tests during the period 1974-2005. The last test was used to study hearing impairment. The mean values for the hearing test at 3, 4, and 6 kHz were used for the ear with worse hearing impairment. Data was compared with a general adult Swedish population (n=603) not occupationally exposed to noise. Equivalent noise levels gate to gate (Leq) were measured in the cockpit of different aircraft. Leq was 75-81 dB (A), peak exposures were 105 dB (A) from the cabin call signal. Median values were similar as in the reference group at all ages. There was no association between years of employment, tobacco smoking, and hearing impairment, when adjusted for age and gender by multiple logistic regressions analysis. In conclusion, pilots are exposed to equivalent noise levels below the current Swedish occupational standard of 85 dB (A), with short peak exposures above the standard, and have normal age-matched hearing thresholds."
"18587592","Can Rh antigens be a risk factor in noise-induced hearing loss?","Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is one of the most common occupational problems and is one of the main causes of deafness. Many factors cause NIHL. Individual susceptibility is one of them. Rhesus (Rh) antigens and ABO blood groups can be factors in determining individual susceptibility. We aim to investigate the relationship between the Rh antigens and NIHL. The study was conducted in 438 factory workers who had been exposed to a noise level more than 85 dB for 8 h a day for a period of &gt;/=15 years. The audiologic results and blood groups were obtained from the individual health records of the factory workers. We determined NIHL in 236 (53.9%) workers. Two hundred and nineteen (55.4%) of Rh-positive workers and seventeen (39.5%) of Rh-negative workers have NIHL, and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05), whereas no statistically significant difference was determined between the NIHL and ABO blood groups. In conclusion, we suggest that the people with Rh-positive blood group are more prone to develop NIHL."
"18520580","Pure-tone threshold description of an elderly French screened population.","OBJECTIVES: To describe the distribution of pure-tone hearing thresholds of a Caucasian population living in the south of France aged 70 years and older. To establish age- and sex-adjusted normative hearing thresholds based on results of subjects free of noise and ototoxic drug exposure and to compare them with hearing thresholds of exposed (E) subjects.DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of a longitudinal epidemiologic cohort study.SETTING: Montpellier suburb, south of France.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 778 subjects 70 years old and older were examined. Noise exposure, ototoxic medication use, and medical history were collected. Hearing thresholds were obtained via pure-tone audiometry. After excluding patients with ear-related disease, 659 subjects were further analyzed (270 men and 389 women). Noise or ototoxic medication exposure was found in 364 subjects (E subjects), whereas 295 had no exposure (nonexposed [NE] subjects).METHODS: Median pure-tone thresholds, lower deviation, and upper deviation were calculated for the NE subjects with a statistical method similar to the ISO 7029 norm and were compared with thresholds of E subjects.RESULTS: Hearing thresholds, especially in high frequencies, increased with age more for women than for men. Median thresholds of E subjects were significantly higher than those for the NE sample in men.CONCLUSION: Age- and sex-adjusted hearing thresholds could well be useful in the study of the impact of environmental and genetic factors on hearing loss in the elderly. The next step would be to quantify the impact of noise, ototoxic drug exposure, and genetics using these age- and sex-adjusted thresholds."
"18479630","Occupational noise-induced tinnitus: does it affect workers' quality of life?","OBJECTIVES: This prospective study aimed to investigate the quality of life of workers in a steel factory.METHODS: The study group was composed of 16 male workers with tinnitus and 30 ears. Fifteen male workers without tinnitus and 30 ears were included into the control group. Workers were evaluated by questionnaire, pure-tone audiometry, and the SF-36 Health Survey. In the study group, tinnitus loudness levels (TLLs) were found.RESULTS: In the study group, the domains general mental health and role limitations owing to emotional problems were significantly lower than in the control group. Older age, industrial noise exposure over a long period, higher noise exposure during work, and hearing loss secondary to occupational noise caused workers to experience higher TLLs. Earheadings protected workers more than earplugs, and TLLs were lower. Important factors that affect workers' quality of life are maximum exposed noise levels, daily and total noise exposure time, and exposure to continuous noise. Occupational noise-induced tinnitus mainly causes emotional disability rather than physical disability. Emotionally impaired QOL results may be due to tinnitus-related psychological problems.CONCLUSION: Workers should have knowledge about the hazardous effects of noise. Periodic health checkups and regular seminars have great importance. Workers must be aware of other ototoxic factors, such as medications and noisy music. In the future, researchers should develop a screening method to detect those with a more hereditary affinity to hearing loss."
"18469718","The burdens of age-related and occupational noise-induced hearing loss in the United States.","OBJECTIVES: Aging and noise are generally considered the most common causes of adult hearing loss in developed countries. This study estimates the contributions of aging and occupational noise in the United States.DESIGN: A model of hearing loss burden in American adults was constructed using data from the Census Bureau, from an international standard that predicts age-related and noise-induced hearing loss (ISO-1999), from the American Medical Association method of determining hearing impairment, and from sources estimating the distribution of occupational noise exposure in different age and sex groups.RESULTS: Occupational noise exposure probably accounts for less than 10% of the burden of adult hearing loss in the United States; most of the rest is age-related. Most of the occupational noise burden is attributable to unprotected exposures above 95 dBA, and becomes apparent in middle age, when occupational noise exposure has ceased but age-related threshold shifts are added to prior noise-induced shifts, resulting in clinically significant impairment.CONCLUSIONS: In our current state of knowledge, noise-induced hearing loss is still the most important preventable cause of hearing loss in the United States. The burden of occupational noise-induced hearing loss could probably be reduced by stricter enforcement of existing regulations. Longer lifespans in developed countries and migration of manufacturing jobs to developing countries will continue to reduce the relative contribution of occupational hearing loss in countries like the United States. Preventive interventions for age-related hearing loss, even if only partially effective, could potentially reduce the burden of adult hearing loss more than elimination of occupational noise."

"18404276","Noise induced hearing loss and other hearing complaints among musicians of symphony orchestras.","OBJECTIVES: An investigation of the hearing status of musicians of professional symphony orchestras. Main questions are: (1) Should musicians be treated as a special group with regard to hearing, noise, and noise related hearing problems (2) Do patterns of hearing damage differ for different instrument types (3) Do OAE have an added value in the diagnosis of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) in musicians.METHODS: 241 professional musicians, aged between 23-64 participated. A brief medical history and the subjective judgment of their hearing and hearing problems were assessed. Musicians were subjected to an extensive audiological test battery, which contained testing of audiometric thresholds, loudness perception, diplacusis, tinnitus, speech perception in noise, and otoacoustic emissions.RESULTS: Most musicians could be categorized as normal hearing, but their audiograms show notches at 6 kHz, a frequency that is associated with NIHL. Musicians often complained about tinnitus and hyperacusis, while diplacusis was generally not reported as a problem. Tinnitus was most often localized utmost left and this could not be related to the instrument. It was usually perceived in high frequency areas, associated with NIHL. In general, musicians scored very well on the speech-in-noise test. The results of the loudness perception test were within normal limits. Otoacoustic emissions were more intense with better pure-tone thresholds, but due to large individual differences it can still not be used as an objective test for early detection of NIHL.CONCLUSIONS: Musicians show more noise induced hearing loss than could be expected on the basis of age and gender. Other indicators, such as complaints and prevalence of tinnitus, complaints about hyperacusis and prevalence of diplacusis suggest that musicians' ears are at risk. Continuing education about the risks of intensive sound exposure to musicians, with the emphasis on the possible development of tinnitus and hyperacusis and the need for good hearing protection is warranted."
"18363008","Effect of basic military training on hearing in the Singapore Armed Forces.","INTRODUCTION: In the military service, hearing is at risk through exposure to impulse noise from firing and detonations. This study aims at looking into the consequences of military training on hearing acuity, as it would be useful to confirm the effectiveness of the hearing conservation programme in the Singapore Armed Forces.METHODS: A self-controlled study of 118 Singapore military conscripts was carried out, using questionnaires administered by trained personnel and pure tone audiometric assessments performed for both ears. The questionnaire and audiometry were done at the start of basic military training (BMT), with follow-up audiometry done at the end of BMT and one year into vocational military training (VT).RESULTS: 33 military conscripts were excluded subsequently in latter phases of the study. Of the 85 remaining conscripts, 16.5 percent of the study population were found to have abnormal audiograms at the start of BMT. At the end of the BMT phase, the percentage of enlistees with abnormal audiograms was 9.4 percent. By the end of one year of VT, the percentage of enlistees with abnormal audiograms was still 9.4 percent. Analysis of the differences in number of enlistees with hearing loss was done with the McNemar's test, and was found to be statistically insignificant (p-value equals 0.238).CONCLUSION: The prevalence of 16.5 percent abnormal audiograms at the pre-BMT stage is probably related to unfamiliarity with the audiogram testing and/or &quot;temporary threshold shift&quot; effect. There was no significant difference in the number of enlistees with hearing loss upon enlistment and after one year of military training in this cohort of soldiers."
"18307091","Iris pigmentation and susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss.","The purpose of this retrospective study is to examine the possible association between iris pigmentation and susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss in 2407 noise-exposed workers. The workers were between 16 to 65 years of age and were exposed to 2 to 42 years of work-related noise. Results demonstrated that dark-eyed workers presented a greater percentage of normal pure-tone thresholds than fair-eyed workers. Fair-eyed workers had threshold averages of 25.1 dB (right ear) and 26.0 dB (left ear) at 3, 4, and 6 kHz, which were significantly worse than workers with dark irises, with threshold averages of 15.8 dB and 17.2 dB in the right and left ear, respectively (p&lt;0.01). Fair-eyed workers with less than 10 years of noise exposure had the same audiometric pattern as the dark-eyed workers exposed for more than 10 years. Workers not exposed to noise did not present significant differences in their audiometric pattern as a function of eye colour. These results suggest that iris pigmentation may be an additional indication of susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss."
"18307090","The risk of tinnitus following occupational noise exposure in workers with hearing loss or normal hearing.","The purpose was to investigate the relationship between noise exposure and tinnitus among workers with normal hearing and hearing loss, respectively. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 752 workers employed at 91 workplaces, that were investigated by means of full work-shift noise levels, questionnaire data, and bilateral pure-tone audiometry. Tinnitus was not associated with the present noise level, the duration of noise exposure, or the cumulative noise exposure if participants had normal hearing. As expected, such trends were demonstrated if participants had a hearing handicap. Based on these data, we will be cautious in ascribing tinnitus to noise exposure in our patients' workplaces if they have a normal audiogram. Furthermore our data indicates no risk of noise-induced tinnitus at exposure levels where no hearing loss would be expected, e.g. as usually encountered in non-industrial workplaces."
"18307089","Is the relation of social class to change in hearing threshold levels from childhood to middle age explained by noise, smoking, and drinking behaviour?","Recent work shows that variation in adult hearing function is related both to social class of origin and current social class. This study examines how much of this relationship after adjustment for childhood hearing impairment is explicable by occupational noise, current smoking, and alcohol consumption. A cohort of 9023 persons born in the UK during one week in 1958 was followed periodically, and hearing threshold levels (HTLs) were measured at 1 kHz and 4 kHz at age 45 years. Most (71% and 68%, at 1 kHz and 4 kHz respectively) of the relation to social class of origin of adult HTLs remains after adjustment for these other factors. For the relation to current social class, corresponding values are 64% and 44% (though varying by gender). The magnitude of social class effect is comparable to that of occupational noise. Susceptibility to hearing impairment is likely to be appreciably determined in early childhood."

Sound pressure levels were measured during a rehearsal, indicating mean levels ranging from 96.4 dB(A) to 106.9 dB(A). Subjects answered questionnaires and underwent audiometry. They attended a lecture in which folders and hearing protection aids were provided; subjects were asked to try using the protectors for 3 months.RESULTS: At the end of the study period, 56.2% reported not liking hearing protection, while 43.7 % accepted such protection. The most common complaints were discomfort with sounds (58.8 %) and tinnitus (47%). 77.1% said that music might cause hearing impairment. A statistically significant difference was observed in the right ear at 4 and 6 kHz and at the left ear in 3, 4 and 6 kHz when median thresholds were compared with those from unexposed controls.CONCLUSION: Although most subjects seemed aware of the risk, few took preventive measures against hearing loss. This suggests the need for periodic educational campaigns and specific legislation tailored to music professionals."
"18165194","Relationship between styrene exposure and hearing loss: review of human studies.","Styrene is an aromatic solvent belonging to the alkylbenzene family. Occupational exposure to styrene occurs mainly in the manufacturing of fiberglass-reinforced polyester products, e.g. reinforced plastics and composites. Since 1988, nine studies have been published on the relationship between occupational exposure to styrene and hearing loss. All studies were the cross-sectional epidemiological studies or clinical studies from occupational health clinics. A total of more than 1000 workers exposed to styrene, both with and without concurrent noise exposure, were examined using different outcome measures for hearing loss. Exposure assessment was usually based on styrene measurements in the breathing zone during several hours of one working day. Some of the studies employed also the biological monitoring of styrene exposure based on determination of its urinary metabolites. The current exposures to styrene varied between 2 and 35 ppm. In some studies, lifetime exposure was calculated using company records and questionnaire data. The current exposure to noise was estimated by noise dosimetry or standard noise measurements. Lifetime noise exposure was assessed using questionnaire data and occupational noise estimates. In many studies, noise-exposed groups were used as controls together with the unexposed workers. Of the nine studies, seven show some effects on the auditory system that were associated with styrene-alone exposure. These effects are examined using different outcome measures such as pure tone audiometry, high frequency hearing loss, and central hearing tests. In some studies, an increased risk for hearing loss was associated with exposure estimates."
"20024522","Occupation and the risk of hearing impairment--results from the Nord-Trøndelag study on hearing loss.","OBJECTIVES: We studied the effect of occupation on hearing and if it remained after adjustment for noise exposure, education, income, and other risk factors.METHODS: Audiometry and a questionnaire concerning exposure was administered to a general adult population sample in Norway (N=49,948). Information on occupation, education, and income was obtained from population census registers.RESULTS: Occupation had marked effects on hearing loss. Occupation explained 2-3% of the variance in hearing loss among men &gt; or =45 years in addition to the hearing loss due to age (10-19%). Occupation explained &lt; or =1% of hearing loss among women of all ages and young men. Controlling for self-reported occupational noise exposure reduced the occupational effect by 20-40% in men &gt; or =45 years. Controlling for leisure-time noise, ear infections, and head injuries did not change the effect of occupation, which was slightly reduced after controlling for education and income. The most elevated hearing thresholds in men were observed among: wood workers; miners; linemen and cable jointers; construction carpenters and workers; seamen; and workshop mechanics.CONCLUSIONS: There was a moderate association between occupation and hearing loss. Unbiased estimates of occupational hearing loss may help identify high-risk occupations, for which interventions are needed, and identify individuals with hearing loss."

In the current study, we examined the relationship between gene polymorphisms in UCP1 and UCP2 and hearing impairment (HI) in Japanese elderly.METHODS: A total of 1547 subjects aged 40-79 years and living in Aichi prefecture, Japan, were entered into this study. Subjects were followed up every 2 years, and the cumulative number of subjects for 3 sequential examinations in 6 years was 4942 persons. Detailed questionnaires, pure-tone audiometry measurements, and UCP1 A-3826G and UCP2 Ala55Val polymorphisms were examined. Using generalized estimating equations, associations between HI and gene polymorphisms in UCP1 and UCP2 with age, sex, history of occupational noise exposure, and body mass index were analyzed under dominant, recessive, and additive models.RESULTS: UCP1 A-3826G polymorphism did not exhibit any significant association with HI.

DNA samples were collected from the 10% most susceptible and the 10% most resistant individuals. Four SNPs in the introns of SOD1 were genotyped and their effects and interactions with noise exposure were analyzed.RESULTS: Genotype AA of rs2070424 conferred protection against NIHL (adjusted OR = 0.45, p = 0.005), while GG of rs10432782 was a risk genotype (adjusted OR = 1.88, p = 0.026).

Significant interactions between SOD1 SNPs and noise levels were found. Further analysis of effects of SOD1 SNPs found that those carrying GG genotype of rs10432782 had significantly higher SOD1 activity (p = 0.022), but a significantly lower level of malondialdehyde in plasma, compared with TT carriers (p = 0.007)."
"19853647","Education, occupation, noise exposure history and the 10-yr cumulative incidence of hearing impairment in older adults.","The purpose of this study was to determine the 10-yr cumulative incidence of hearing impairment and associations of education, occupation and noise exposure history with the incidence of hearing impairment in a population-based cohort study of 3753 adults ages 48-92 yr at the baseline examinations during 1993-1995 in Beaver Dam, WI. Hearing thresholds were measured at baseline, 2.5 yr-, 5 yr-, and 10-yr follow-up examinations. Hearing impairment was defined as a pure-tone average (PTA)&gt;25 dB HL at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. Demographic characteristics and occupational histories were obtained by questionnaire. The 10-yr cumulative incidence of hearing impairment was 37.2%. Age (5 yr; Hazard Ratio (HR)=1.81), sex (M vs W; HR=2.29), occupation based on longest held job (production/operations/farming vs others; HR=1.34), marital status (unmarried vs married; HR=1.29) and education (&lt;16 vs 16+yr; HR=1.40) were associated with the 10 yr incidence. History of noisy jobs was not associated with the 10-yr incidence of hearing impairment. The risk of hearing impairment was high, with women experiencing a slightly later onset. Markers of socioeconomic status were associated with hearing impairment, suggesting that hearing impairment in older adults may be associated with modifiable lifestyle and environmental factors, and therefore, at least partially preventable."
"19786896","Peripheral and central auditory dysfunction induced by occupational exposure to organic solvents.","OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of solvent exposure on hearing function, through an audiological test battery, in a population not occupationally exposed to high levels of noise.METHODS: One hundred ten workers from a coating factory were studied. Jobs at the factory were divided into three different levels of solvent exposure. Hearing status was assessed with a test battery including pure-tone hearing thresholds (0.5-8 kHz), high-frequency hearing thresholds (12 and 16 kHz), and dichotic listening measured through dichotic digits test. Multiple linear regression models were created to explore possible association between solvent exposure and each of the hearing outcomes.RESULTS: Significant associations between solvent exposure and the three hearing outcomes were found. Covariates such as age, gender, race, and ethnicity were also significantly associated with the studied hearing outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: Occupational exposure to solvents may induce both peripheral and central auditory dysfunction. The dichotic digits test seems as a sensible tool to detect central auditory dysfunction associated with solvent exposure. Hearing loss prevention programs may use this tool to monitor hearing in solvent-exposed workers."
"19643173","Glutathione S-transferase M1, T1, and P1 polymorphisms as susceptibility factors for noise-induced temporary threshold shift.","The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is thought to be part of the mechanism underlying noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Glutathione is an important cellular antioxidant that limits cell damage by ROS. We aimed to determine the effect of genetic polymorphisms of glutathione S-transferase (GST) T1, GSTM1, and GSTP1, on temporary threshold shift (TTS) in 58 noise-exposed male workers from a steel factory. The pre-shift hearing impairment at high frequency (HF, average of 3, 4, and 6kHz) was 30.7dB HL (S.D.=19.3). The amount of daily noise exposure was 83.0dBA (S.D.=5.0). Noise-induced TTS at HF by pure-tone audiometry (PTA) was related to the daily noise exposure (p&lt;0.05). Based on combinatory analysis, we found that individuals carrying all genotypes with GSTT1 null, GSTM1 null, and GSTP1 Ile(105)/Ile(105) were more susceptible to NIHL. These results suggest that pre-shift hearing impairment and daily noise exposure had impacts on TTS at HF by PTA. In addition, GST genetic polymorphisms may modify the susceptibility to noise-induced TTS."
"19633561","Notched audiograms and noise exposure history in older adults.","OBJECTIVE: Using data from a population-based cohort study, we compared four published algorithms for identifying notched audiograms and compared their resulting classifications with noise exposure history.DESIGN: Four algorithms: (1) , (2) , (3) , and (4) were used to identify notched audiograms. Audiometric evaluations were collected as a part of the 10-yr follow-up examinations of the Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study, in Beaver Dam, WI (2003-2005, N = 2395). Detailed noise exposure histories were collected by interview at the baseline examination (1993-1995) and updated at subsequent visits. An extensive history of occupational noise exposure, participation in noisy hobbies, and firearm usage was used to evaluate consistency of the notch classifications with the history of noise exposure.RESULTS: The prevalence of notched audiograms varied greatly by definition (31.7, 25.9, 47.2, and 11.7% for methods 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). In this cohort, a history of noise exposure was common (56.2% for occupational noise, 71.7% for noisy hobbies, 13.4% for firearms, and 81.2% for any of these three sources). Among participants with a notched audiogram, almost one-third did not have a history of occupational noise exposure (31.4, 33.0, 32.5, and 28.1% for methods 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively), and approximately 11% did not have a history of exposure to any of the three sources of noise (11.5, 13.6, 10.3, and 7.6%). Discordance was greater in women than in men.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that there is a poor agreement across existing algorithms for audiometric notches. In addition, notches can occur in the absence of a positive noise history. In the absence of an objective consensus definition of a notched audiogram and in light of the degree of discordance in women between noise history and notches by each of these algorithms, researchers should be cautious about classifying noise-induced hearing loss by notched audiograms."

Before, at the end, and six months after the end of noise exposure, we performed pure-tone audiometry, Carhart test, Peyser test, thresholds of discomfort test (TDT), tympanometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), and auditory brainstem response (ABR). At the end of the noise exposure, the audiological tests showed a worsening of the mean air and bone audiometric thresholds at the 2,000 (1/10), 4,000 (7/10), and 8,000 Hz (6/10); a fail status of the TEOAE and DPOAE, which were previously present, in all the divers; temporary threshold shift, at the Peyser test, in 9/10 divers; discomfort for pulse tone presented at the TDT test, in all the divers; no post exposure significant differences at the Carhart and ABR tests, in any of the divers. Six months after the end of noise exposure, all the divers presented a complete recovery of their audio-vestibular functions. Our results show the temporary negative effects of repeated and lasting exposure to active sonar (Hull MF) on the divers; the last control demonstrate the absence of permanent noise-induced hearing loss in divers exposed to active sonar."

Pure-tone audiometry (125-8000 Hz) and 3 temporal processing tests (gaps-in-noise, frequency pattern test and duration pattern test) were carried out. Significant differences between groups were found for most of the audiometric thresholds for both ears. ANCOVA analysis showed that styrene-exposed subjects had significantly poorer performances on the frequency and duration pattern tests than nonexposed subjects, when including hearing level and age as covariates. The results of the present research study suggest an association between styrene exposure and central auditory dysfunction characterized by a temporal processing disorder."
"19249881","The prevalence and correlates of hearing loss in drivers in isfahan, iran.","BACKGROUND: There are no data on the prevalence of occupational noise-induced hearing loss in drivers using standard audiometric testing. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and risk factors of occupational noise-induced hearing loss in drivers.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a random sample of 4300 long-distance drivers age &gt; or =20 years taken out of a total of 10,000 estimated professionals in the city of Isfahan, Iran, from February 2006 through March 2007. The drivers were interviewed and underwent clinical and laboratory examinations including measurement of blood pressure, anthropometric data, and pure-tone audiometry in a sound-treated booths. The mean (SD) age of the participants was 40.8 (11.0) years with a mean (SD) duration of professional driving of 14.7 (9.6) years.RESULTS: The prevalence of bilateral noise-induced hearing loss was 18.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 17.0~19.3]. The prevalence rates were higher in the left ear only 6.5% (95% CI: 5.8~7.3) than the right ear only 3.0 percent; (95% CI: 2.5~3.9). Using a stepwise binary logistic regression model for the right and left ear only and for both ears separately, age was a significant independent predictor of bilateral noise-induced hearing loss and for the left or right ear only. When bilateral noise-induced hearing loss was entered in the model, fasting blood glucose was a significant predictor of noise-induced hearing loss. Blood pressure, cholesterol, triglyceride, body mass index, and marital status had no significant independent association with noise-induced hearing loss when other covariates were considered.CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that noise-induced hearing loss among the long-distance drivers appears to be similar to the world's population endures noise-induced hearing loss caused by occupational exposure to noise, with higher prevalence in the left ear only."
"19206875","Detecting incipient inner-ear damage from impulse noise with otoacoustic emissions.","Audiometric thresholds and otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) were measured in 285 U.S. Marine Corps recruits before and three weeks after exposure to impulse-noise sources from weapons' fire and simulated artillery, and in 32 non-noise-exposed controls. At pre-test, audiometric thresholds for all ears were &lt;or=25 dB HL from 0.5 to 3 kHz and &lt;or=30 dB HL at 4 kHz. Ears with low-level or absent OAEs at pre-test were more likely to be classified with significant threshold shifts (STSs) at post-test. A subgroup of 60 noise-exposed volunteers with complete data sets for both ears showed significant decreases in OAE amplitude but no change in audiometric thresholds. STSs and significant emission shifts (SESs) between 2 and 4 kHz in individual ears were identified using criteria based on the standard error of measurement from the control group. There was essentially no association between the occurrence of STS and SES. There were more SESs than STSs, and the group of SES ears had more STS ears than the group of no-SES ears. The increased sensitivity of OAEs in comparison to audiometric thresholds was shown in all analyses, and low-level OAEs indicate an increased risk of future hearing loss by as much as ninefold."

"21302411","Prevention of acute acoustic trauma by earmuffs during military training.","BACKGROUND: Impulse noise produced from firearms can potentially damage hearing organs resulting in sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). In Chiang Mai during 1997, Detphithak et al reported a prevalence of acute acoustic trauma (AAT) in 22% of new military privates using an H.K.33 for shooting practice without hearing protection. The H.K.33 renders an average sound pressure level of 128 dBA. Earmuffs are claimed by their manufacturing company to attenuate noise 27 dB, and they have been recently introduced in Chiang Mai to prevent AAT.OBJECTIVE: To study the outcomes of hearing protection against AAT using earmuffs during shooting training (H.K.33) in the Military Reserve Officer Training Corps (MROTC).MATERIAL AND METHOD: A quasi - experiment study was conducted among 267 normal hearing MROTCs in the Reserve Officers Student Training Center (ROSTC) of the 33rd Military Circle, Chiang Mai, Thailand. Their condition of hearing was examined by an otolaryngologist and an audiologist using pure tone audiometry (PTA) before shooting practice, within 2 hours after the practice, 3 days after the practice at the ROSTC; and 1 month later at Fort Kawila Hospital, Chiang Mai, Thailand.RESULTS: All 267 MROTCs used earmuffs during shooting practice. Their mean age was 17.95 years. Average sound pressure level of an HK.33 was 127 dBA (range; 126.5-130 dBA). AAT was found in 4 persons (1.5%) within two hours after shooting. Repeat testing 3 days later revealed that only one person (0.37%) still had SNHL. Fortunately, this case reached complete recovery within 1 month. When comparing these findings with those of 1997, earmuffs can reduce AAT by 15 times (95% confidence interval 5.3-40.5, p-value &lt; 0.0001) to a negligible level.CONCLUSION: Shooting training with an H.K. 33 produces a dangerous sound pressure level at the shooting site, resulting in a possible high risk of acute acoustic trauma. Earmuffs can effectively reduce this risk by approximately 15 times, and they should be widely used in all shooting training."
"21059594","Use of historical data and a novel metric in the evaluation of the effectiveness of hearing conservation program components.","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of hearing conservation programs (HCP) and their specific components in reducing noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at one food-processing plant and two automotive plants. Audiometric and work-history databases were combined with historical noise monitoring data to develop a time-dependent exposure matrix for each plant. Historical changes in production and HCP implementation were collected from company records, employee interviews and focus groups. These data were used to develop time-dependent quality assessments for various HCP components. 5478 male (30,427 observations) and 1005 female (5816 observations) subjects were included in the analysis.RESULTS: Analyses were conducted separately for males and females. Females tended to have less NIHL at given exposure levels than males. Duration of noise exposure stratified by intensity (dBA) was a better predictor of NIHL than the standard equivalent continuous noise level (L(eq)) based upon a 3-dBA exchange. Within this cohort, efficient dBA strata for males were &lt;95 versus = 95, and for females &lt;90 versus = 90. The reported enforced use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) significantly reduced NIHL. The data did not have sufficient within-plant variation to determine the effectiveness of noise monitoring or worker training. An association between increased audiometric testing and NIHL was believed to be an artifact of increased participation in screening.CONCLUSIONS: Historical audiometric data combined with noise monitoring data can be used to better understand the effectiveness of HCPs. Regular collection and maintenance of quality data should be encouraged and used to monitor the effectiveness of these interventions."

After audiological evaluation (pure tone audiometry, middle ear analysis, TEOAE and DPOAE) hearing protective devices were provided to be used for three months. After that musicians answered a satisfaction assessment questionnaire.RESULTS: The prevalence of hearing loss was of 21.7%. The most common complaints about the hearing protectors were: autophonia, pressure in the ears, interference in high frequencies perception and full time use of the hearing protector during concerts. There was a positive correlation between a reduction in tinnitus after the use of the HPD with the following complaints: tinnitus after beginning the career (p= 0.044), discomfort with the sound intensity in the work place (p= 0.009) and intolerance to loud sound (p= 0.029).CONCLUSIONS: There was a high prevalence of hearing loss and a positive tendency towards the use of the ear protector device among the sample population."

"20828512","Predicting hearing thresholds and occupational hearing loss with multiple-frequency auditory steady-state responses.","OBJECTIVE: An objective investigation is needed to verify the existence and severity of hearing impairments resulting from work-related, noise-induced hearing loss in arbitration of medicolegal aspects. We investigated the accuracy of multiple-frequency auditory steady-state responses (Mf-ASSRs) between subjects with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) with and without occupational noise exposure.DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.SETTING: Tertiary referral medical centre.METHODS: Pure-tone audiometry and Mf-ASSRs were recorded in 88 subjects (34 patients had occupational noise-induced hearing loss [NIHL], 36 patients had SNHL without noise exposure, and 18 volunteers were normal controls).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Inter- and intragroup comparisons were made. A predicting equation was derived using multiple linear regression analysis.RESULTS: ASSRs and pure-tone thresholds (PTTs) showed a strong correlation for all subjects (r = .77  .94). The relationship is demonstrated by the equationThe differences between the ASSR and PTT were significantly higher for the NIHL group than for the subjects with non-noise-induced SNHL (p &lt; .001).CONCLUSIONS: Mf-ASSR is a promising tool for objectively evaluating hearing thresholds. Predictive value may be lower in subjects with occupational hearing loss. Regardless of carrier frequencies, the severity of hearing loss affects the steady-state response. Moreover, the ASSR may assist in detecting noise-induced injury of the auditory pathway. A multiple linear regression equation to accurately predict thresholds was shown that takes into consideration all effect factors."
"20689029","Listening habits of iPod users.","PURPOSE: To estimate real-environment iPod listening levels for listeners in 4 environments to gain insight into whether average listeners receive dosages exceeding occupational noise exposure guidelines as a result of their listening habits.METHOD: The earbud outputs of iPods were connected directly into the inputs of a digital recorder to make recordings of listening levels. These recordings were used to estimate listening levels using reference recordings made in a real ear. Recordings were made in 4 environments with a wide range of background noises: (a) a library, (b) a student center, (c) busy streets, and (d) the subway.RESULTS: None of the 64 listeners were estimated to exceed allowable occupational dosages, with a maximum dose of 7.57% based on Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA; 1998) methods and 10.83% based on National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH; 1998) methods.CONCLUSIONS: All of the listeners surveyed were exposed to dosages well below OSHA and NIOSH occupational regulations. Although this does not guarantee individual safety, the results do not support the widespread concern regarding the safety of common iPod usage. However, measurements made in this study agree with the finding that iPod output can exceed safe levels and further support recommendations to monitor and limit listening volume and listening duration."

We calculated percentage loss of hearing (PLH) and used regression models to examine whether there was an association between PLH and F-111 fuel tank maintenance, adjusting for possible confounders. In addition, the difference between the observed hearing thresholds and the expected thresholds based on an otologically normal population (ISO-7029-2003) was determined.RESULTS: The PLH ranged from nil to 96 (median 1.5, quartiles 0.3, 5.5). A logistic regression model showed no statistically significant difference in PLH among the three exposure groups (exposed vs. non-technical controls 1.1: 95% CI 0.7, 2.0 and exposed vs. technical OR 0.9: 95% CI 0.6, 1.3). The model also highlighted a number of other risk factors for PLH including age, tinnitus, smoking, depression, and use of depression medications. However, at all eight frequencies measured, all populations had lower than expected hearing thresholds based on published ISO-7029 medians.CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no difference in PLH between the three exposure groups, the study did reveal a high degree of hearing loss between the 3 groups and a normal population."
"20584863","Temporary threshold shifts at 1500 and 2000 Hz induced by loud voice signals communicated through earphones in the pinball industry.","To assess the risk of hearing loss among workers using earphones as communication devices at noisy worksites, we compared temporary threshold shifts (TTS) between ears on which workers wore earphones and ears on which no earphones were worn. We measured ambient noise and personal noise exposure as well as noise generated by and passed through earphones by applying frequency analysis at three pinball facilities during their hours of actual operation. We assessed hearing levels before and after a work shift (prework and postwork) of 54 workers by pure tone audiometry at six frequencies. The time-weighted averages for ambient noise and personal noise exposure exceeded 85 dB(A) and 90 dB(A), respectively. Overall sound pressure levels generated by and passing through earphones reached 109 dB(A). The one-third octave band spectrum of the earphone noise during the shift exceeded 90 dB(SPL) in the range of 315-2000 Hz. The number of ears demonstrating a TTS, defined as a shift of 10 dB or more in postwork over prework hearing thresholds, was significantly greater at 1500 and 2000 Hz among ears with earphones (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively) compared to those without. The reverse was observed at 4000 Hz for ears without earphones (P &lt; 0.01). Workers wearing earphones or headsets as communication devices in noisy environments are exposed to high risk of hearing loss, particularly at the frequencies of 1500 and 2000 Hz. Ideally, hearing conservation programs for such workers should account for potential hearing losses at frequencies of 2000 Hz or lower frequencies induced by amplified voice signals."
"20516680","The Annex C fallacy: why unscreened databases are usually preferable for comparison of industrially exposed groups.","One can study occupational noise exposure by comparing hearing thresholds of exposed people to control data from national or international standards. ANSI S3.44 (1996) offers Annex C--thresholds for people without occupational noise exposure--as appropriate control data for such comparisons. Annex C is based on the false assumption that people who have had occupational noise exposure are similar in all other important ways to those without such exposures. In fact, people with noisy jobs are more likely than others to be smokers, diabetics, poorly educated, white and exposed to non-occupational noise. Taking these other risk factors into account, the appropriate thresholds for comparison to industrial study populations are closer to those of the unscreened population than to an 'Annex C' population that simply excludes occupationally noise-exposed persons."
"20430548","The impact of arterial sclerosis on hearing with and without occupational noise exposure: a population-based aging study in males.","OBJECTIVES: Arterial sclerosis contributes to inadequate blood supply to multiple organs, suggesting that general atherosclerosis may play an important role in the inner ear. Since noise is a major etiology for hearing loss, the aim of this study was to evaluate both the respective and the combined effects of arterial sclerosis and occupational noise exposure on hearing after accounting for age in middle-aged and elderly men.METHODS: The evaluation was conducted using 773 subjects from a population-based sample of 1189 men, aged 40-83 years. The impact of carotid atherosclerosis (CA) or retinal arteriolosclerosis (RA) on hearing was assessed according to history of occupational noise exposure (Noise) obtained in a questionnaire. Differences in the mean pure-tone thresholds at each frequency, between the CA (+) and CA (-) groups or between the RA (+) and RA (-) groups, based on noise exposure were compared using the general linear model (GLM) Procedure in SAS, with adjustments for age. Then, the main effect of CA or RA, and the interactive effect of noise and either CA or RA on pure-tone threshold at seven frequencies were analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), after adjusting for age.RESULTS: In the Noise (+) group, a statistically significant deterioration in hearing was found in the CA (+) group compared with the CA (-) group at 500 and 1000 Hz. The results in RA were significant at even lower frequencies than in CA. In the results from ANCOVA, the significant main effect of CA was shown in the pure-tone threshold at 8000 Hz, but not in the analysis of RA. A significant interactive effect of either CA or RA and Noise was observed in hearing at the range from 125 to 1000 Hz.CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that the impact of arterial sclerosis on hearing is limited but significantly hazardous in middle-aged and elderly men, and that arterial sclerosis exacerbates the deleterious effects of noise on hearing. Early recognition of arterial sclerosis might be contributory to the hearing prognosis after middle age, especially for noise-exposed men."

Students completed a questionnaire regarding exposures before a hearing assessment. NIHL was defined by the presence of a notch 15 dB in depth at 4000 or 6000 Hz relative to the best preceding threshold. Overall prevalence of NIHL was 45%, with 78% of notches occurring at 6000 Hz. The proportion of the total population with bilateral notching at any frequency was 11.5%, mostly occurring at 6000 Hz. There was a significant increase in the frequency of notching in students who reported more than two hours per day of personal practice. There were no significant associations for instrument group or other noise exposures. The data suggest that susceptibility to NIHL among students of music is not uniform and cannot be ascribed solely to the instrument played and other exposures. Students with bilateral losses tend to have deeper notches and may represent a group that has an inherent predisposition to NIHL."
"20192875","Otoacoustic emissions in a hearing conservation program: general applicability in longitudinal monitoring and the relation to changes in pure-tone thresholds.","The hearing status of workers (N = 233) in a printing office was assessed twice within seventeen months by pure-tone audiometry and otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). One of the questions was how a quality criterion of OAE-measurements based on a minimum signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) would affect the applicability on the entire population. Secondly, effects of noise exposure were investigated in overall changes in audiogram and OAE-measurements. For TEOAEs (transient evoked OAEs) in the frequency band of 4 kHz, only 55% of the data points meet the SNR-inclusion criterion. For DPOAEs (distortion product OAEs) around 6 kHz approximately 80% of the data points satisfy the criterion. Thus OAEs have a limited applicability for monitoring the hearing status of this entire population. Audiometry shows significant deteriorations at 6 and 8 kHz. TEOAEs show a significant decline at all frequency bands (1-4 kHz), DPOAEs between 4 and 8 kHz and less pronounced between 1 and 2 kHz. On group level, OAEs show a decline in a larger frequency region than the audiogram, suggesting an increased sensitivity of OAEs compared to audiometry."

"20160390","Noise induced hearing loss risk assessment in truck drivers.","Hearing sense is one of the key elements which may have impact on the driver's task quality. This cross-sectional study investigates the hearing status of 500 truck drivers by pure tone audiometry (AC) in one of the cities in Fars province, Iran. Hearing threshold levels of the subjects were measured in frequencies of 500Hz-8000Hz. Screening and determination of permanent threshold shift (PTS) was the first aim of this study. Hence tests were done at least 16 hours after any exposure to noticeable sound. The effect of age as a confounding factor was considered using ISO equation and subtracted from whole hearing threshold. The threshold of 25 dB HL and above was considered abnormal but the calculation of hearing was also carried out using 0 dB HL as reference. Subjects were categorized into two groups on the basis of working experience and the hearing threshold of 25 dB was considered a boundary of normal hearing sense. The results of Pearson Chi-Square test showed that working experience as an independent variable has significant contributing effect on hearing thresholds of truck drivers in frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz (p greater than 0.05). Also, it was shown that currently nine and 12.6 % of truck drivers suffer from impaired hearing sense in left and right respectively (hearing threshold level greater than 25 dB) in mid frequencies (500, 1000, 2000 Hz) and 45% in high frequencies of both ears (4000 and 8000 Hz). The results indicated that hearing damage of professional drivers was expected to occur sooner at 4000 and 8000 Hz than lower frequencies. Finally it was deduced that the occupational conditions of truck drivers may have bilateral, symmetrical harmful effect on hearing threshold sense in all frequencies mainly in frequency of 4000 Hz, so health surveillance programs such as education and periodic medical examinations are emphasized for pre-diagnosing and prevention of any possible impairment and an urgent need to take up some interventions such as better maintenance of roads, automobile industry efforts to reduce the noise level emission of vehicles and reducing number of working hours per day of drivers are highlighted to improve the harmful working conditions of truck drivers."

The ambient wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT index) was measured using quest temp 34/36o area heat stress monitor. A-weighted Leq ambient noise was measured using a quest sound level meter &quot;ANSI SI. 43-1997 (R 2002) type-1 model SOUNDPRO SE/DL&quot;. We also incorporated OSHA norms for hearing conservation which include - an exchange rate of 5dB(A), criterion level at 90dB(A), criterion time of eight hours, threshold level is equal to 80dB(A), upper limit is equal to 140dB(A) and with F/S response rate. Results of the study revealed that occupational heat exposure in melting, casting, forging and punching sections is high compared to ACGIH/NIOSH norms. Ambience noise in various sections like casting / molding, drop forging, cutting presses, punching, grinding and barreling process was found to be more than 90dB(A). About 95% of the workers suffered speech interference where as high noise annoyance was reported by only 20%. Overall, 68% workers were not using any personal protective equipment (PPE). The study concluded that the proportion of SME workers exposed to high level heat stress and noise (60 - 72 hrs/week) is high. The workers engaged in forging and grinding sections are more prone to noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) at higher frequencies as compared to workers of other sections. It is recommended that there is a strong need to implement the standard of working hours as well as heat stress and noise control measures."
"20151883","High frequency audiometric notch: an outpatient clinic survey.","It is a common misconception that high frequency audiometric notches are diagnostic of noise induced hearing loss. The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of high frequency notch (HFN) in an audiovestibular medicine outpatient clinic population at a district general hospital. One hundred and forty nine consecutive adult patients were assessed. According to standard practice at the audiovestibular clinic, a full clinical history with particular emphasis on neuro-otological symptoms, noise exposure, and medical risk factors for sensorineural hearing loss was taken. After standard 8-frequency pure tone audiometry, subjects were divided into those with HFN and those without. There were 84 (56%) females and 65 (44%) males with a mean age of 45 years (range: 19 to 91 years). A total of 39.6% had notches not attributable to noise (occupational or recreational) or any other known risk factor. In 29 (49.2%) and 15 (25.4%) the HFN was present in the left and right ear respectively whereas 15 (25.4%) were bilateral. The frequency least affected was 3 kHz while 4 kHz and 6 kHz were affected in almost equal proportions. In 53 ears (71.6%), the notch depth was less than 20 dBHL (10-19 dB) compared to 21 ears (28.4%) with a depth of 20 dBHL or more. This study concludes that high frequency notch without excessive noise exposure or any other known factor is common. It is neither diagnostic of, nor invariable with NIHL unless a convincing history of hazardous noise exposure is elicited from the history."

Comparisons between groups included (1) change from baseline to most recent audiogram, (2) most recent hearing thresholds and (3) most recent thresholds in a subset of noise exposed and unexposed groups.RESULTS: Hearing thresholds for the TB groups were significantly (p&lt;0.01) elevated compared to the control group, after correcting for time between baseline and most recent audiogram, threshold at baseline and age at test. Pair-wise comparisons demonstrated the largest threshold differences between the control and multiple TB group. Changes in mean thresholds across TB treatment groups were independent of noise exposure. Hearing thresholds over time also deteriorated significantly more (p&lt;0.01) in workers with TB (single and multiple treatment) than in workers without TB.CONCLUSION: Gold miners with TB, especially with more than one episode of TB, demonstrate significantly poorer hearing thresholds and more pronounced decline in hearing over time independent of noise exposure. The exact cause is likely a complex interaction between TB, including treatment, and its associated risk profile."

"21988504","Speech-in-noise screening tests by internet, part 1: test evaluation for noise-induced hearing loss identification.","OBJECTIVE: In the Netherlands three internet-based self-screening tests have been developed; the National Hearing Test (NHT), Earcheck (EC), and Occupational Earcheck (OEC). These tests are adaptive speech-in-noise tests using either digit triplets or monosyllables, presented in stationary speech-shaped noise. These tests can be highly valuable in increasing the awareness and prevention of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). This study evaluates these online speech-in-noise tests and investigates their potential to detect NIHL.DESIGN: In a multi-centre study the results of the three online screening tests are compared to pure-tone audiometry and to the Dutch sentence SRT test ( Plomp &amp; Mimpen, 1979a ), which is considered the clinical standard.STUDY SAMPLE: In total, 49 normal-hearing listeners and 49 patients with different degrees of NIHL participated.RESULTS: The online tests show good reliability, but there is much overlap in outcomes between normal-hearing listeners and participants with early NIHL. In addition, rather low correlations of the test results with both the Dutch sentence SRT test and pure-tone thresholds are found. These findings result in rather low test sensitivity: 54% (NHT) and 51% (EC), or low specificity: 49% (OEC).CONCLUSIONS: The online screening tests in their current form are unsuitable to be used for early NIHL screening purposes."
"21959115","Hearing impairment among workers exposed to excessive levels of noise in ginning industries.","Cotton ginning workers have a risk of hearing loss due to excessive noise levels at the workplace environment. In this study, estimates of typical sound levels prevailing at the workplace environment and its effects on hearing ability of the exposed workers were made among cotton ginning workers. Data on self-reported health status was collected by a questionnaire survey at 10 cotton ginning industries located at Jalgaon district of Maharashtra state, India. The cotton ginning workers were exposed to continuous noise levels between 89 and 106 dBA. The hearing ability of the subjects was accessed by pure tone audiometry. The results of audiometry show mild, moderate and moderately severe degree of hearing impairment among the cotton ginning workers. The data generated during the study show that hearing loss was significantly associated with period of exposure to the workplace noise (P &lt;0.0001). The prevalence of audiometric hearing impairment defined as a threshold average greater than 25 dB hearing level was 96% for binaural low-frequency average, 97% for binaural mid frequency average and 94% for binaural high-frequency average in the cotton ginning workers. We recommend the compulsory use of personal protective equipment like ear plug by the cotton ginning workers at the workplace environment. A regular maintenance of ginning and pressing machineries will avoid the emission of excessive noise at the workplace environment of cotton gins. A regular periodic medical examination is necessary to measure the impact of workplace noise on the health of cotton ginning workers."
"21936701","Clinical characteristics of acoustic trauma caused by gunshot noise in mass rifle drills without ear protection.","One of the major occupational hazards of working in military service is being subjected to intense impulse noise. We analyzed the clinical presentation of acoustic traumas, induced by mass rifle gunshot noise during military training, in unprotected patients. We evaluated 189 soldiers who had otologic symptoms after rifle shooting exercises without using any hearing protection. All soldiers had been training on the K2 rifle. We took medical histories; conducted physical examinations and hearing evaluations (pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry, and impedence audiometry); and distributed the Newmann's Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) survey. In addition, we evaluated a normal control group of 64 subjects of similar age who had never fired a rifle. In the patient group, the most common and irritating reported symptom was tinnitus (94.2%), and the average THI score in the patient group was 39.51 ± 14.87, which was significantly higher than the control group score (0.56 ± 3.94) (p &lt; 0.001). Average outcomes of post-exposure air conduction thresholds were 21.33 ± 13.25 dB HL in the affected ears. These levels also were significantly higher than those of the control group (9.16 ± 4.07dB HL) (p &lt; 0.001). Hearing loss was most prominent at high frequencies. An asymmetry of hearing loss related to head position during shooting was not observed. Acoustic trauma induced by gunshot noise can cause permanent tinnitus and hearing loss. Hearing protection (bilateral earplugs) and environmental reform are necessary."

"21873915","Validity of self-rated hearing compared with audiometric measurement among construction workers.","BACKGROUND: A valid assessment of hearing status is important to detect hearing loss early and prevent further loss in noise-exposed individuals or older adults. Self-report is used widely in research and is often the only possible measure to evaluate hearing ability.OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to establish the level of validity of self-rated hearing by comparing it with the results of audiograms and to examine correlations and changes in self-rated and measured hearing status over time.METHODS: Survey and audiogram data collected from 403 construction workers at two different time points (Years 1 and 2) were used in the hearing protection intervention study. Self-rated hearing was assessed on a 5-point rating scale using a single question (&quot;How do you rate your hearing?&quot;). Hearing was measured via audiograms conducted at frequencies 0.5 through 8 kHz. Three pure-tone threshold average (PTA) indicators, PTA 0.5-2 kHz, PTA 0.5-3 kHz, and PTA 4-6 kHz, of the worse ear were used and compared with self-ratings at two time points.RESULTS: Percentage of agreement between the self-rated and measured hearing was lowest in PTA 4-6 kHz and highest in PTA 0.5-3 kHz for both years. Cohen's kappas showed fair to moderate (.25-.45) agreement. Sensitivity was higher (.82-.89) in the speech frequencies and lower (.51-.55) at higher frequencies. Specificity was better at higher frequencies than at lower frequencies (.83-.89 vs .68-.74). Although there was no appreciable change in self-rated hearing and limited change in measured hearing on all 3 indicators from Years 1 to 2, correlations between self-rated and measured hearing were higher in Year 2.DISCUSSION: A single-item question about an individual's hearing ability is moderately useful and valid to assess hearing loss and can be recommended for a population-based study only if audiograms are not available, but self-report hearing screening should not be considered an adequate substitute for the standardized audiometric test. Providing audiograms and feedback on the results apparently enhanced individuals' ability to judge their hearing status."
"21846812","Development and validation of a screening questionnaire for noise-induced hearing loss.","BACKGROUND: An audiometric health surveillance programme can be perceived to be a relatively costly exercise and employers, especially in developing countries, might therefore be reluctant to undertake this. A questionnaire might be a cheaper alternative.AIMS: To develop a questionnaire to help determine the prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in the vernacular (language) of a developing country and to validate it against an audiometric standard.METHODS: A questionnaire was developed, translated and administered in a face-to-face interview. Otoscopic examination was followed by conventional pure-tone audiometry (at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 kHz) for both ears of each respondent. The questionnaire responses were compared to the audiometric standard.RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty workers from three companies (two printing and one woodworking) participated in this study. The sensitivity of the hearing loss questionnaire in detecting noise-induced hearing loss was 32%, while its specificity was 79%. There was an evidence to suggest good agreement (r = 0.523) between the total number of years worked in noisy jobs and NIHL (P &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The questionnaire developed in this study was found to have an unacceptably low sensitivity for noise-induced hearing loss and therefore cannot be a valid substitute for audiometry. Pure tone industrial audiometry needs to be used more widely than currently in developing countries."

The procedures included the following items: questionnaire regarding personal and professional background, period of exposition to organophosphates, otoscopy, pure-tone audiometry. Auditory temporal processing was tested through: the Frequency Pattern Test, the Duration Pattern Test and the Gaps-In-Noise Test. Performance on the tests were analyzed, as well as differences between left and right ears on the Gaps-In-Noise Test, and education level in all tests.RESULTS: In great part of the subjects, auditory temporal processing performance was below normal standards. There was no difference between ears on the Gaps-In-Noise Test (p=0.33). Additionally, no differences were found on any of the tests according to education level (Gaps-In-Noise: p=0.21 on the right ear, and p=0.053 on the left ear; Frequency Pattern Test: p=0.37; Duration Pattern Test: p=0.84).CONCLUSION: Temporal resolution and temporal order abilities were altered in individuals occupationally exposed to organophosphate pesticides, even when they showed normal peripheral auditory thresholds."
"21822855","Audiological implications of earplugs used for the prevention of aural exostoses.","External auditory canal exostoses may be a preventable disease, so it is surprising that the regular use of water precautions is not greater among surfers. One reason for this is the impairment of hearing whilst wearing earplugs. The objective of this study is to establish the hearing impairment of commonly available earplugs used by surfers. Staff and patients with normal hearing were recruited to have pure tone audiometry performed multiple times, initially with no earplugs, and subsequently with earplugs. Three earplug types were tested which differed in their nature and material (prefabricated elastomer, custom-fitted silicone, and custom-fitted acrylic). Vented and non-vented forms of the earplugs were tested. 30 normal hearing ears were included. Two-tailed paired t-tests comparing hearing thresholds between different earplugs identified that the elastomer earplugs caused the least hearing impairment (p &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference in hearing thresholds between vented and non-vented elastomer earplugs (p = 0.148), but the difference between vented and non-vented forms of other earplugs was statistically significant (silicone p = 0.010, acrylic p = 0.018). Prefabricated ear plugs produce less hearing impairment than other commonly available earplugs. A customised earplug made of hard material causes the greatest impairment of hearing. We therefore recommend that for aquatic sports where hearing is important, a soft prefabricated earplug is preferable."
"21812635","A multicenter study on the audiometric findings of styrene-exposed workers.","OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate hearing loss among workers exposed to styrene, alone or with noise.DESIGN: This cross-sectional study was conducted as part of NoiseChem, a European Commission 5th Framework Programme research project, by occupational health institutes in Finland, Sweden, and Poland.STUDY SAMPLE: Participants' ages ranged from 18-72 years (n = 1620 workers). Participants exposed to styrene, alone or with noise, were from reinforced fiberglass products manufacturing plants (n = 862). Comparison groups were comprised of workers noise-exposed (n = 400) or controls (n = 358). Current styrene exposures ranged from 0 to 309 mg/m(3), while mean current noise levels ranged from 70-84 dB(A). Hearing thresholds of styrene-exposed participants were compared with Annexes A and B from ANSI S3.44, 1996.RESULTS: The audiometric thresholds of styrene exposed workers were significantly poorer than those in published standards. Age, gender, and styrene exposure met the significance level criterion in the multiple logistic regression for the binary outcome 'hearing loss' (P = 0.0000). Exposure to noise (&lt;85 dBA p = 0.0001; =85 dB(A) p = 0.0192) interacted significantly with styrene exposure.CONCLUSIONS: Occupational exposure to styrene is a risk factor for hearing loss, and styrene-exposed workers should be included in hearing loss prevention programs."
"21802644","Dichotic multiple-frequency auditory steady-state responses in evaluating the hearing thresholds of occupational noise-exposed workers.","An objective, fast, and reasonably accurate assessment test that allows for easy interpretation of the responses of the hearing thresholds at all frequencies of a conventional audiogram is needed to resolve the medicolegal aspects of an occupational hearing injury. This study evaluated the use of dichotic multiple-frequency auditory steady-state responses (Mf-ASSR) to predict the hearing thresholds in workers exposed to high levels of noise. The study sample included 34 workers with noise-induced hearing impairment. Thresholds of pure-tone audiometry (PTA) and Mf-ASSRs at four frequencies were assessed. The differences and correlations between the thresholds of Mf-ASSRs and PTA were determined. The results showed that, on average, Mf-ASSR curves corresponded well with the thresholds of the PTA contours averaged across subjects. The Mf-ASSRs were 20±8dB, 16±9dB, 12±9dB, and 11±12dB above the thresholds of the PTA for 500Hz, 1,000Hz, 2,000Hz, and 4,000Hz, respectively. The thresholds of the PTA and the Mf-ASSRs were significantly correlated (r=0.77-0.89). We found that the measurement of Mf-ASSRs is easy and potentially time saving, provides a response at all dichotic multiple frequencies of the conventional audiogram, reduces variability in the interpretation of the responses, and correlates well with the behavioral hearing thresholds in subjects with occupational noise-induced hearing impairment. Mf-ASSR can be a valuable aid in the adjustment of compensation cases."
"21768736","The influence of military service on auditory health and the efficacy of a Hearing Conservation Program.","The influence of military service on self-assessed hearing symptoms and measured auditory function was studied as well as the efficacy of the Hearing Conservation Program (HCP) of the Swedish Armed Forces. 839 conscripts were recruited for the study at reporting to military service. They were all exposed to noise over the risk-limits from weapons and vehicles and used earmuffs and/or earplugs. Questionnaires and pure tone screening audiometry were studied at the start and the end of the military service. Retrospective information regarding audiometry at conscription before military service was included as control. The prevalence values of tinnitus were 23% before and 32% after the service and of sensitivity to noise 16% and 19% respectively. The prevalence values of hearing impairment were 6.3% at conscription, 14.5% at reporting to military service, and 24% after the training period. The incidence values of hearing decline were 3.7% during the period with no military noise exposure and 6.6% during the military service. Acoustic accident increased the risk of worsened tinnitus and sensitivity to noise four times and for a high frequency hearing decline six times. We observed elevated prevalence values of tinnitus, sensitivity to noise and hearing impairment at discharge compared to before military service. We observed an elevated risk of hearing decline during military service. Acoustic accident increased the risk of tinnitus, noise sensitivity and hearing decline. We suggest improvements regarding inclusion criteria for military service, and for education regarding the HCP."

Pure tone average hearing thresholds, for each ear, were compared between groups, and between sexes and ages within groups.RESULTS: A slight threshold difference was found between the two groups at 4 kHz. After adjusting for age and gender, this difference was found to be related only to differing patient age. Men's and women's thresholds differed significantly in both groups, especially at high frequencies, at which threshold deterioration was worse in men than women.CONCLUSION: The threshold differences between patients with presbycusis with and without noise exposure were limited. Larger studies are needed to assess the relative effects of ageing and noise exposure on hearing thresholds."
"21695357","Evidence of noise-induced hearing loss in young people studying popular music.","The number of students studying popular music, music technology, and sound engineering courses at both school and university to has increased rapidly in the last few years. These students are generally involved in music-making/recording and listening to a high level, usually in environments with amplified music. Recent studies have shown that these students are potentially exposed to a high risk of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL( and are not covered by the same regulatory framework as employees. This study examined the pure tone air conduction hearing thresholds of 50 undergraduate students, including recent school leavers, on a range of popular music courses, to assess if there was evidence of hearing loss. Forty-four percent of students showed evidence of audiometric notch at 4-6 kHz, and 16% were classified under the UK Occupational Health and Safety guidelines as exhibiting mild hearing loss. Instance of audiometric notch was considerably higher than reported from studies of the general population but was around the same level or lower than that reported from studies of &quot;traditional&quot; music courses and conservatoires, suggesting no higher risk for popular music students than for &quot;classical&quot; music students. No relationship with age was present, suggesting that younger students were as likely to exhibit audiometric notch as mature students. This indicates that these students may be damaging their hearing through leisure activities while still at school, suggesting a need for robust education measures to focus on noise exposure of young people."
"21682404","Is it necessary to penalize impulsive noise +5 dB due to higher risk of hearing damage?","It is studied whether the +5 dB penalty for impulsiveness established by ISO 1999:1990 accounts for a higher risk of noise-induced hearing loss. A total of 16 normal-hearing human subjects were exposed for 10 min to two types of binaural industrial-recordings: (1) a continuous broad-band noise normalized to L(EX,8 h)=80 dBA and (2) the combination of the previous stimulus with an impulsive noise normalized to L(EX,8 h)=75+5(db penalty)=80 dBA (peak level 117 dBC and repetition rate of 0.5 impacts per second). Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were measured in a broad frequency range before and in the following 90 min after the exposure. The group results show that the continuous exposure had a bigger impact on DPOAE levels, with a maximum DPOAE shift of approximately 5 dB in the frequency range of 2-3.15 kHz during the first 10 min of the recovery. No evident DPOAE shift is seen for the impulsive + continuous stimulus. The results indicate that the penalty overestimated the effects on DPOAE levels and support the concept that the risk of hearing loss from low-level impulses may be predicted on an equal-energy basis."

Data were available for 89/99 right/left ears on enlistment and 99/100 for LGV. Mean time between examinations was 4.1 years (range 1.4-12.6 years). By the LGV examination, there was deterioration in 69/99 right and 77/100 left ears, with the hearing loss in 8% of right and 13% of left ears falling into the 'warning' or 'referral' categories (Control of Noise at Work Regulations 2005) compared with 1% at enlistment. These differences reached statistical significance (P &lt; 0.05 and &lt; 0.001, respectively)CONCLUSIONS: Statistically significant hearing losses occur in some firefighters during the early stages of their careers. Further work needs to be done to establish if this continues, and steps taken to reduce the noise hazard at work."

Pure-tone averages in decibels reflecting low (250, 500, and 1,000 Hz), middle (500, 1,000, and 2,000 Hz), and high (2,000, 4,000, and 8,000 Hz) frequencies were calculated for each ear. CVD risk factors, aortic pulse-wave velocity (PWV), and ankle-arm index (AAI) were obtained at study baseline.RESULTS: In sex-stratified models, after adjustment for age, race, study site, and occupational noise exposure, risk factors associated with poorer hearing sensitivity in men included high triglyceride levels, high resting heart rate, and history of smoking. In women, poor hearing sensitivity was associated with high body mass index, high resting heart rate, fast PWV, and low AAI.CONCLUSION: Modifiable risk factors for CVD may play a role in the development of age-related hearing loss."

This study used hearing loss values (HLVs) measured at 4 kHz and 6 kHz in both ears as a biomarker to investigate the chronic effects of noise exposure on hypertension in 790 aircraft-manufacturing workers.METHODS: Participants were divided into a high hearing loss (HL) group (n = 214; average HLVs = 30 decibel [dB] at 4 kHz or 6 kHz bilaterally; 83.1 ± 4.9 A-weighted decibel [dBA]), a median HL group (n = 302; 15 = average HLVs &lt; 30 dB at 4 kHz or 6 kHz bilaterally; 83.1 ± 4.4 dBA) and a low HL group (n = 274; average HLVs &lt; 15 dB at 4 kHz or 6 kHz bilaterally; 82.2 ± 5.1 dBA) based on the results of pure tone audiometry. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to estimate the risk of hypertension between groups.RESULTS: The prevalence rates of hypertension were significantly higher in the high HL (43.5%; p = 0.021) and median HL (42.1%; p = 0.029) groups than in the low HL group (33.2%). The high HL and median HL workers had 1.48-fold (95% confidence interval [95%CI] = 1.02-2.15; p = 0.040) and 1.46-fold (95%CI = 1.03-2.05; p = 0.031) higher risks of hypertension relative to the low HL workers. Employment duration was significantly and positively correlated with the risk of hypertension among workers with average HLVs = 15 dB at 4 kHz (p &lt; 0.001) and 6 kHz (p &lt; 0.001) bilaterally.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that high-frequency hearing loss is a good biomarker of occupational noise exposure and that noise-induced hearing loss may be associated with the risk of hypertension."

This study describes the validity of computer-based, diagnostic air and forehead bone conduction audiometry when compared wtih conventional industry standard audiometry in a sound booth environment. A sample of 30 subjects (19 to 77 years of age) was assessed with computer-based (KUDUwave 5000) and industry standard conventional audiometers (GSI 61) to compare air and bone conduction thresholds and test-retest reliability. Air conduction thresholds for the two audiometers corresponded within 5 dB or less in more than 90% of instances, with an average absolute difference of 3.5 dB (3.8 SD) and a 95% confidence interval of 2.6 to 4.5 dB. Bone conduction thresholds for the two audiometers corresponded within 10 dB or less in 92% of instances, with an average absolute difference of 4.9 dB (4.9 SD) and a 95% confidence interval of 3.6 to 6.1 dB. The average absolute test-retest threshold difference for bone conduction on the industry standard audiometer was 5.1 dB (5.3 SD) and for the computer-based audiometer 7.1 dB (6.4 SD). Computer-based audiometry provided air and bone conduction thresholds within the test-retest reliability limits of industry standard audiometry."

However, commonly-used audiometric databases either do not take these differences into account, or account for them using data not easily generalized to the US population. The objective of this study was to obtain distributions that are generalizable to the US population without significant history of exposure to occupational noise. Cumulative pure tone threshold distributions from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III and the 1999-2004 data from the continuous NHANES were fitted with an asymmetric sigmoid function with reverse asymmetry, by gender, ethnicity, age, ear, and the stimulus frequency. Results indicated that conditional distributions based on these factors are warranted. Percentiles on the cumulative distribution functions can be transformed into standard normal variates (i.e. z-scores) to facilitate combination of results over time or across individuals with different demographic characteristics. However, combinations across frequency could obscure meaningful differences between the reference group and the hearing test results under analysis."

"21246211","Hearing loss in divers: a 6-year prospective study.","Occupational diving is associated with hearing loss, but the cause is disputed. Our aim was to follow a cohort of divers through the first 6 years of their career in order to look for evidence of permanent threshold shift associated with diving activity, occupational noise exposure or acute injuries. Hearing was measured by pure tone audiometry in 67 participants at a basic course for working divers. Hearing thresholds were adjusted for age (ISO 7029). The subjects were examined and interviewed by an otologist. Additional medical and exposure data were recorded in questionnaires and personal logbooks. The procedure was repeated after 3 and 6 years. None of the subjects suffered inner ear barotrauma or inner ear decompression sickness during follow-up. Middle ear barotrauma was common. The prevalence of subjective hearing difficulties increased during follow-up, and there was a significant threshold shift at 4 kHz (mean 2.6 dB, 95% confidence interval 0.9-4.3 dB). Both subjective and objective hearing loss was associated with occupational noise exposure, but not with diving frequency or with a history of middle ear barotrauma. In the absence of manifest inner ear barotrauma or inner ear decompression sickness, noise seems to be the most important cause of long-term hearing loss in occupational divers. This study did not find evidence of long-term hearing loss caused by uneventful diving per se."

This study examines hearing threshold levels of a large population of Dutch construction workers and compares their hearing thresholds to those predicted by ISO-1999.METHODS: In this retrospective study, medical records of periodic occupational health examinations of 29,644 construction workers are analysed. Pure-tone audiometric thresholds of noise-exposed workers are compared to a non-exposed control group and to ISO-1999 predictions. Regression analyses are conducted to explore the relationship between hearing loss and noise intensity, noise exposure time and the use of hearing protection.RESULTS: Noise-exposed workers had greater hearing losses compared to their non-noise-exposed colleagues and to the reference population reported in ISO-1999. Noise exposure explained only a small proportion of hearing loss. When the daily noise exposure level rose from 80 dB(A) towards 96 dB(A), only a minor increase in hearing loss is shown. The relation of exposure time and hearing loss found was similar to ISO-1999 predictions when looking at durations of 10 years or more. For the first decade, the population medians show poorer hearing than predicted by ISO-1999.DISCUSSION: Duration of noise exposure was a better predictor than noise exposure levels, probably because of the limitations in noise exposure estimations. In this population, noise-induced hearing loss was already present at the beginning of employment and increased at the same rate as is predicted for longer exposure durations."

The thresholds of higher frequency band, 3 kHz and 4 kHz were compared with the threshold of ABR. The thresholds of auditory frequency ban and 0.5 kHz were compared with the threshold of 40 Hz AERP.RESULTS: A better correlation was found between thresholds of ABR and higher frequency pure tone audiometry. There was a significant difference of thresholds between 40 kHz AERP and pure tone audiometry. The correction values of thresholds between 40 kHz AERP and pure tone audiometry in the light noise-induced hearing impairment group and the moderate noise-induced hearing impairment group were (16.43 ± 1.08) and (11.80 ± 1.12) dBn HL, respectively.CONCLUSION: In diagnosis of occupational noise-induced hearing impairment, the threshold of ABR can be used to estimate the hearing threshold of pure noise higher frequency. Because there is the significant difference of the thresholds between pure tone audiometry and 40 Hz AERP, the response threshold can not be served as the audiometry threshold, and the behavioral hearing thresholds can only be obtained by adjusting the response threshold with respective correction value."

We evaluated 82 organophosphate sprinklers from the São Paulo State Regional Superintendence who were active in the fight against dengue and who were exposed to noise and organophosphates. We performed pure tone audiometry and applied the translated THI (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory) questionnaire.RESULTS:  Of the sample, 28.05% reported current tinnitus or had presented tinnitus, and the workers with tinnitus had an increased incidence of abnormal audiometry. The average hearing threshold for the 4-8-kHz frequency range of the workers with current tinnitus was higher than that of the others, and was most affected at the 4-kHz frequency. The THI score ranged 0-84, with an average score of 13.1. Twelve (52.17%) workers had THI scores consistent with discrete handicap.CONCLUSION:  There is an increased incidence of abnormal pure tone audiometry in workers with tinnitus, and its impact on the workers' quality of life was discrete. The correlation between average hearing threshold and tinnitus distress was weak."
"22718110","Prevalence of permanent hearing threshold shift among workers of Indian iron and steel small and medium enterprises: a study.","Occupational noise exposure and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) have been recognized as a problem among workers in Indian industries. The major industries in India are based on manufacturing. There are appreciable numbers of casting and forging units spread across the country. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of permanent hearing threshold shift among the workers engaged in Indian iron and steel small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and compared with control group subjects. As a part of hearing protection intervention, audiometric tests were conducted at low (250-1000 Hz), medium (1500-3000 Hz), and high (4000-8000 Hz) frequencies. The occurrence of hearing loss was determined based on hearing threshold levels with a low fence of 25 dB. Comparisons were made for hearing threshold at different frequencies between the exposed and control groups using Student's t test. ANOVA was used for the comparison of hearing threshold dB at different frequencies among occupation and year of experience. A P value &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All data were presented as mean value (SD). Over 90% of workers engaged in various processes of casting and forging industry showed hearing loss in the noise-sensitive medium and higher frequencies. Occupation was significantly associated with NIHL, and hearing loss was particularly high among the workers of forging section. The analyses revealed a higher prevalence of significant hearing loss among the forging workers compared to the workers associated with other activities. The study shows alarming signals of NIHL, especially in forging workers. The occupational exposure to noise could be minimized by efficient control measures through engineering controls, administrative controls, and the use of personal protective devices. Applications of engineering and/or administrative controls are frequently not feasible in the developing countries for technical and financial reasons. A complete hearing conservation programme, including training, audiometry, job rotation, and the use of hearing protection devices, is the most feasible method for the protection of industrial workers from prevailing noise in workplace environments in the developing countries."

Detailed history and clinical examination of ear, impedence audiometry and pure tone audiometry was performed.RESULTS: Mean age group was 29.82 years; 82(74.5%) were males and 28 (25.5%) were females. Mean duration of service is 11.86 years. Twenty six (23.6%) had tinnitus and 39(35.5%) had blocked sensation in ear. Sixty five (59.1%) worked between 10- 19 years. Alcohol and smoking shows positive impact on NIHL (p value =0.00). Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval were 4.481 (1.925-10.432) and 6.578 (2.306- 18.764) respectively. Among 73(66.4%) noise induced hearing loss positive cases, bilateral involvement was seen in 45 (40.9%) and unilateral in 28(25.4 %) cases. Among unilateral cases most were left sided. Hearing threshold at 4 kHz increased according to age and duration of service.CONCLUSION: Traffic police personnel are in constant risk of noise induced hearing loss. Screening for hearing loss is recommended for people exposed to noise."
"22568995","The effect of noise exposure on the cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential.","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of noise exposure on the cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP) in individuals with asymmetric noise-induced sensorineural hearing loss (NIHL).DESIGN: A cross-sectional observational study was used to compare cVEMP characteristics in 43 individuals with a history of noise exposure greater in one ear (e.g., the left ear of a right-handed rifle shooter) and asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss consistent with the history of noise exposure and in 14 age-matched controls. The characteristics of hearing loss were examined further for the noise-exposed participants with abnormal cVEMPs and the noise-exposed participants with normal cVEMPs.RESULTS: Thirty-three percent of the noise-exposed participants had abnormal cVEMPs, whereas cVEMPs were present and symmetrical in 100% of the age-matched controls, and cVEMP threshold was greater in the noise-exposed group than in the control group. Abnormal cVEMPs occurred most often in the ears with poorer hearing (or greater NIHL), and the noise-exposed participants who had abnormal cVEMPs had poorer high-frequency pure-tone thresholds (greater NIHL) and greater interaural high-frequency pure-tone threshold differences than the noise-exposed participants with normal cVEMPs.CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with previous studies that suggest that the sacculocollic pathway may be susceptible to noise-related damage. There is emerging evidence that the severity of NIHL is associated with the presence or absence of cVEMPs."
"22517306","Early occupational hearing loss of workers in a stone crushing industry: our experience in a developing country.","Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is an irreversible sensorineural hearing loss associated with exposure to high levels of excessive noise. This paper aims to assess the prevalence of early NIHL and the awareness of the effects of noise on health among stone crushing industry workers. This was a comparative cross-sectional study in Ghana of 140 workers from the stone crushing industry compared with a control group of 150 health workers. The stone workers and controls were evaluated using a structured questionnaire, which assessed symptoms of hearing loss, tinnitus, knowledge on the health hazards associated with work in noisy environment and the use of hearing protective device. Pure tone audiometric assessment was carried out for stone workers and controls. Noise levels at the work stations of the stone workers and of the controls were measured. Statistical Analysis of data was carried out using SPSS package version 16. The mean age of stone workers and controls was 42.58±7.85 and 42.19±12 years, respectively. Subjective hearing loss occurred in 21.5% of the workers and in 2.8% of the controls. Tinnitus occurred in 26.9% of stone workers and 21.5% of controls, while 87.5% stone workers had sound knowledge on the health hazards of a noisy environment. Early NIHL in the left ear occurred in 19.3% of the stone workers compared with 0.7% in controls and in the right ear, it occurred in 14.3% of the stone workers and in 1.3% of the controls; P&lt;0.005. In conclusion, the prevalence rate of early NIHL among stone crushing workers is about 19.3% for the left ear and 14.3% for the right ear."
"22492021","Sunlight exposure may be a risk factor of hearing impairment: a community-based study in Japanese older men and women.","BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress is an important factor in the pathology of age-related hearing loss. Recent animal studies have reported that ultraviolet radiation in sunlight is related to systemic induction of oxidative stress. Chronic sun exposure leads to photodamaged skin, which is manifested as facial skin wrinkling and hyperpigmentation. We hypothesized that sunlight exposure, as assessed by the severity of facial skin photodamage, might be associated with hearing impairment through an oxidative stress mechanism. To examine this, we performed a cross-sectional analysis by using the baseline data from a community-based cohort study of older Japanese.METHODS: A total of 805 residents (342 men and 463 women) aged 65 years or older living in Kurabuchi Town, Gunma prefecture, Japan, were examined between 2005 and 2006. Facial skin condition was quantified by image analysis of standardized facial images. Hearing impairment was defined as a failure to hear a 30-dB signal at 1 kHz and a 40-dB signal at 4 kHz in the better ear in pure-tone audiometric tests.RESULTS: In men, facial wrinkle was positively associated with hearing impairment (for highest vs lowest: multivariate-adjusted odds ratio, 2.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-4.66; p for trend = .01). Stratified analysis by age, educational level, smoking status, sunscreen or foundation use, and diabetes showed results similar to those for men as a whole. This association was particularly pronounced in men with the low levels of antioxidants and without occupational noise exposure. We observed no apparent association in women.CONCLUSIONS: The results support the hypothesis that chronic sun exposure is a risk factor of hearing impairment."
"22436020","Overall versus individual changes for otoacoustic emissions and audiometry in a noise-exposed cohort.","OBJECTIVE: For a noise-exposed group of workers, group-averaged and individual changes were compared for pure-tone audiometry, transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs), and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) in order to see if they exhibit the same pattern in time.DESIGN: Baseline and 17-months follow-up hearing status was examined with pure-tone audiometry, TEOAEs, and DPOAEs.STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 233 noise-exposed employees were measured, while 60 subjects from this group contributed to test-retest reliability measures.RESULTS: Group-averaged changes and individual shifts followed similar patterns: decreases for audiometry at 6-8 kHz and DPOAE at 1.5 kHz, and enhancements for DPOAE at 3 kHz. TEOAEs showed an overall deterioration while both individual deteriorations and enhancements were larger than chance. DPOAE at 6 kHz showed the largest group-averaged change, while the number of individual shifts was not significant. There were no clear relations between changes in audiometry and changes in OAE.CONCLUSION: Significant individual OAE changes do not necessarily follow the same pattern as the group-averaged results. This limits the applicability of OAE testing for the monitoring of individual subjects. Furthermore, hearing deterioration might manifest itself in a local enhancement of otoacoustic emissions and not only in the form of decreases in amplitude."
"22387711","Validation of a questionnaire to identify hearing loss among farm operators.","Workers in certain industries (e.g., agriculture) do not participate in a hearing conservation program and rarely receive this important preventive care. The National Institute for Deafness and Communication Disorders (NIDCD) has published a questionnaire to assess a person's need for medical examination of their hearing. The use of a self-administered questionnaire may pose a simple, low cost opportunity to assess the hearing health of workers not included in a hearing conservation program. However, the validity of the NIDCD questionnaire has not been tested. A study was conducted to compare the results of audiometric screening and the NIDCD questionnaire in identifying persons at risk for hearing impairment who may benefit from a medical referral. Data were collected from 103 farm operators at a regional farm show. Receiver-operator characteristic curves, measuring the ability of the questionnaire to correctly classify those with and without the disease suggested that the level of performance of the questionnaire as a whole, ranged from 0.74 to 0.69 (fair to poor). However, selected questionnaire items (e.g., Do you have to strain to understand conversations?) had moderate agreement (0.38 to 0.41) with screening audiogram results. Overall, the 10-item instrument did not perform as well as instruments with fewer items reported in separate studies. These findings suggest that, while less desirable than audiometry, alternative self-administered instruments might perform the better in this group. This approach may be useful as an alternative screening method to detect risk of hearing loss and identifying the need for medical evaluation of hearing sensitivity, particularly among farm operators."
"22387708","Validity of hearing impairment calculation methods for prediction of self-reported hearing handicap.","Worker's compensation for hearing loss caused by occupational noise exposure is calculated by varying methods, from state to state within the United States (US), with many employing arithmetic formulas based on the pure-tone audiogram, to quantify hearing loss. Several assumptions unsupported or weakly supported by empirical data underlie these formulas. The present study evaluated the ability of various arithmetic hearing impairment calculations to predict a self-reported hearing handicap in a sample of presenting with sensorineural hearing loss. 204 adults (127 male, 77 female) ranging in age from 18 to 94 served as participants. The sample was selected to exclude patients who had been referred for hearing testing for a medicolegal examination or a hearing conservation appointment. A hearing handicap was measured by the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults/for the Elderly (HHIA/E). The covariance analysis of linear structural equations was used to assess the relative strength of correlation with the HHIA/E score among the six formulas and various forms of pure-tone average. The results revealed that all the hearing impairment calculations examined were significantly, but weakly, correlated with the self-reported hearing impairment scores. No significant differences among the predictive abilities of the impairment calculations were evident; however, the average binaural impairment assigned differed significantly among the six calculations examined. Individuals who demonstrated 0% impairment had significantly lower (i.e., better) HHIA/E scores compared to those with non-zero impairment for each formula. These results supported the idea that audiometric data provided an insufficient explanation for real-world hearing difficulties."
"22387707","Audiological and electrophysiological assessment of professional pop/rock musicians.","In the present study, we evaluated peripheral and central auditory pathways in professional musicians (with and without hearing loss) compared to non-musicians. The goal was to verify if music exposure could affect auditory pathways as a whole. This is a prospective study that compared the results obtained between three groups (musicians with and without hearing loss and non-musicians). Thirty-two male individuals participated and they were assessed by: Immittance measurements, pure-tone air conduction thresholds at all frequencies from 0.25 to 20 kHz, Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions, Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR), and Cognitive Potential. The musicians showed worse hearing thresholds in both conventional and high frequency audiometry when compared to the non-musicians; the mean amplitude of Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions was smaller in the musicians group, but the mean latencies of Auditory Brainstem Response and Cognitive Potential were diminished in the musicians when compared to the non-musicians. Our findings suggest that the population of musicians is at risk for developing music-induced hearing loss. However, the electrophysiological evaluation showed that latency waves of ABR and P300 were diminished in musicians, which may suggest that the auditory training to which these musicians are exposed acts as a facilitator of the acoustic signal transmission to the cortex."

"22338236","Screening of dental staff nurses for noise induced hearing loss.","OBJECTIVES: The effect of noise on employees of dental clinics is debatable. The purposes of this study were to determine the intensity and frequency components of dental instruments used by dental staff nurses and the prevalence of noise induced hearing loss.METHODOLOGY: We performed a comparative, cross sectional study on a group of dental staff nurses. Participants underwent ear examination followed by pure tone audiometry. Pure tone audiometry was performed at least 48 hours after the participants were free from noise exposure. Noise induced hearing loss was defined as failed definitive threshold at a frequency of 4000 Hz greater than 20 dB. The intensity level, noise spectrum, and frequency of hand piece, saliva suction, and scaler were recorded during the dental procedure.RESULTS: A total of 65 dental staff nurses were included. The mean intensity of hand pieces, scalers, and saliva suctions were 88.7 (SD2.2), 87.1 (SD2.6), and 77.4 (SD6.3) dBA while their most prominent frequencies were 3880, 7997, and 3513 Hz, respectively. Three of the subjects had slightly more than 20 dB hearing loss at 4 kHz on audiogram; all were affected unilaterally. These three individuals worked as dental nurses for 11, 13, and 21 years, respectively. Therefore, the prevalence of noise induced hearing loss was 5.0% (95% CI: -1.0%, 10.0%).CONCLUSIONS: Dental staff nurses might have an increased risk of noise induced hearing loss, depending upon individual factors influencing susceptibility and duration of noise exposure."
"22326290","Relative risk of elevated hearing threshold compared to ISO1999 normative populations for Royal Australian Air Force male personnel.","OBJECTIVE: This paper introduces a new method to calculate relative risks of elevated hearing thresholds, at various ages and frequencies, between a study population and ISO1999:2003: Annex A Screened, Annex B Unscreened and ISO1999 Section 5.3 adjustment for noise exposure using Annex A Screened data. We demonstrate this method on a study population of male Royal Australian Air Force personnel.STUDY DESIGN: Using a retrospective cohort design, hearing thresholds were assessed in 583 F-111 aircraft maintenance personnel, 377 technical-trade comparisons and 492 non-technical comparisons using pure-tone audiometry. A quantile regression model was used determine whether an association exists between median hearing thresholds and F-111 maintenance, adjusting for possible confounders. The new method involves using quantile regression models with bootstrapped standard errors to estimate percentiles for the study population and thus determine the probability of a greater than 25 dB hearing threshold. This was done for the three ISO datasets as follows; for the ISO1999 Annex A screened population data the formula provided allows the calculation of these probabilities. ISO1999 Annex B unscreened population data only provides the values for the 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles at ages 30, 40, 50 and 60 only, therefore it was necessary to fit a curve to these values in order to estimate the probabilities. For ISO1999 Section 5.3 adjustment for noise exposure population we used the Annex A screened population data plus the formula. The probabilities were then divided to give the relative risks of a greater than 25 dB hearing threshold, at various ages and frequencies.RESULTS: While no difference was observed between the three groups, the model identified a number of significant confounders, namely tinnitus, smoking, diabetes and the use of anti-depressant medications. Relative risks were high at frequencies 2 kHz and less for the study population of all ages compared to ISO A screened data. The increased relative risks at 4 and 6 kHz give the appearance of a &quot;noise notch&quot; for ages 30 and 40 years. The comparison with the ISO B unscreened data are significantly less than one for frequencies above 2 kHz, particularly for young men and greater than one less than 2 kHz. The relative risks for the comparison to the ISO A screened data with ISO 5.3 adjustments, are highest for young men decreasing with age, with the highest relative risk are at frequencies less than 2 kHz.CONCLUSIONS: This paper demonstrates a new method for quantifying the probability of a clinically relevant hearing loss and the relative risk of the loss due to a risk factor. Prior to this, researchers were reduced to simplistic methods such as visual comparison of deciles which did not enable the estimation of risk. The new method can use all observed hearing thresholds per study participant, adjust for known confounding factors such age and gender, and calculate the relative risk of a clinically relevant increase in hearing threshold due to a risk factor of interest."
"22234848","[Göttingen sentence in noise for different audiogram classes].","BACKGROUND: In addition to the standardized Freiburg sentence test in silence validated speech tests in noise are available. They are mainly used to test the benefit of hearing systems in everyday-life situations. In diagnostics tests in noise can also give additional information of the patients' hearing impairment. The determined speech reception threshold (SRT) depends on the degree of hearing loss and the used speech and noise test material. Aim of this study was to analyze the results of the Göttingen sentence test in noise in relation to different audiogram classes.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Göttingen sentence test in stationary noise (65 dB) was performed for 135 patients with different degrees of hearing losses. Based on the air-conducted threshold all ears were categorized to an audiogram class by an automated procedure.RESULTS: For the mild hearing losses the results of the Göttingen sentence test increased with increasing pure-tone-average (PTA) and the values are smaller than 0 dB SNR with a small standard deviation (± 1-2 dB SNR). For the moderate hearing losses values of 5 dB SNR with a standard deviation of 6 dB SNR were achieved on average. Patients with a high hearing loss achieved values higher than 20 dB SNR.CONCLUSION: For the mild hearing losses the results were located in a small range. However, they can give important information about the patient's hearing impairment mainly appears in a noisy environment. With increasing hearing loss also the reduced hearing in silence affects the results achieved with the Göttingen sentence test in noise. Therefore the hearing in silence has to be taken into account at the interpretation of the results."
"24220478","Occupational safety threats among dental personnel and related risk factors.","Occupational diseases are primarily considered to be important health problems for individuals with occupations in heavy industry fields. Although dentists work in very clean and elegant offices, they are frequently exposed to various chemicals and high-intensity, sound-producing instruments, such as compressors and aerators. In our study, we aimed to investigate the risk for occupational hearing loss of dental personnel, by performing pure-tone audiometry in 40 dentists and comparing the results with those of healthy individuals. We also sampled the nasal mucosa to investigate the effects of occupational chemicals on the nasal mucosa of the dentists. The pure-tone audiometric thresholds at 5 different frequencies (1000, 2000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz) and working time were evaluated as potential risk factors. The pure-tone audiometric results (as decibels) at each frequency and the median values for each side (right and left ears) were significantly higher for dentists than for the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The pure-tone audiometric results did not significantly differ between the women and men in the study group (P &gt; 0.05). The findings in the nasal mucosa (goblet cell hyperplasia, neutrophil/eosinophil/basophil distribution, metaplasia, dysplasia, premalignant or malignant cells) were similar in the study and control groups (P &gt; 0.05). In conclusion, our study indicated that high-intensity, sound-producing equipment is an important occupational threat for dentists, whereas chemical agents have minimal hazardous effects. "

To investigate this group further, pure tone audiometry and a 14-item questionnaire were used to assess the hearing health, as well as attitudes and practices regarding hearing conservation, among 142 French horn players attending an international horn conference in Brisbane, Australia. Of this study's French horn players, 11.1% to 22.2%, and 17.7% to 32.9% of those aged =40 years, showed some form of hearing loss (corrected for age and gender) typical of NIHL, using conservative versus lenient criteria, respectively. Stepwise multiple regression analyses showed no obvious predictor of hearing loss in this study's participants. Of the 18% of participants who reported using hearing protection, 81% used this protection &quot;sometimes&quot; and 50% used generic, foam, or other inferior forms of protection. Continued efforts to better manage the hearing health of horn players is warranted particularly as any hearing loss will affect a horn player's ability to perform and therefore his or her livelihood. Managing the hearing health of horn players will be challenging, however, with no simple predictor of NIHL loss being identified in this study's sample."

Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DP) at 65/55 dB SPL and pure-tone audiometry were used to detect noise-induced inner ear changes. Repeated measures analyses of variance were made on the subjects and in a control group, whereas significant threshold shifts (STS) and significant emission shifts (SES) were calculated. Both hearing thresholds and DP showed a high-frequency deterioration, but there was absence of statistical correlation between elevation of hearing thresholds and decrease of DP. There was no clear pattern between individual changes in audiometric thresholds and DP, and all combinations were present: ears with only STS, ears with only SES, ears with both STS and SES and ears with absence of STS and SES. Audiometric changes were maximal at 4 and 6 kHz and DP changes at 2 and 3 kHz. Since significant individual emission changes do not necessarily follow the same pattern as the group-averaged results, the use of DP for monitoring of individual subjects is not advised. However, its use in conjunction with audiometry in hearing conservation programs is highly recommended."

The tonal threshold audiometry was carried out before and after a shiftwork. The extra-aural effect of noise was assessed from the characteristics of cardiac rhythm variability. The study included two groups of subjects: in one of them (n=8) they used ordinary flight headsets (control) in the other the protection was ensured with the help of multi-insert hearing protectors (n=16). The initial hearing thresholds were found to be increased up to 70 and 60 dB at the frequencies of 4 and 8 kHz respectively. The regression analysis revealed the relationship between these parameters and the duration of aerodrome work experience. Temporary threshold shifts were observed only in the control group. An increase in the tone of the sympathetic nervous system was observed in the control subjects but was absent in the study group. It is concluded that the multi-component hearing protectors employed in the present study are highly efficacious anti-noise devices. The mechanisms of noise-induced hearing loss are discussed. "
"23887702","Hearing loss and use of hearing protection among career firefighters in the United States.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and characteristics of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and the use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) among career firefighters.METHODS: A Web-based survey and a standard audiometric test were performed with 425 firefighters from three states in the United States.RESULTS: More than 40% showed hearing loss in the noise-sensitive frequencies (4 and 6 kHz). The left ear showed significantly poorer hearing than the right ear. Firefighters having longer years of work in fire services demonstrated significantly worse hearing. Reported use of HPDs was 34% of the time that was needed. Firefighters who used HPDs less were significantly more likely to have hearing loss.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a considerable NIHL problem and low use of HPDs in firefighters. More comprehensive hearing conservation programs should be implemented to reduce NIHL for firefighters."
"23860785","[The Königsteiner Empfehlung of 2012 - essential alterations and modifications].","BACKGROUND: Since 1974, the recommendation for assessment of hearing impairment caused by noise - formerly known as &quot;Königsteiner Merkblatt&quot; (now: &quot;Königsteiner Empfehlung&quot;) - has been representing the state of the art for the assessment of the occupational disease BK-No. 2301. It was updated several times, the last time in 2012. It provides a summary of the current medical knowledge. A new measurement for the entire working life - the Effective Noise Dose by Liedtke - was introduced. Otoacoustic emissions (OAE) are now the crucial tests in order to detect a hair cell dysfunction. As from now the tinnitus has to be put under a more comprehensive examination. On the strength of post experience the previous speech audiometry (Freiburger Test) is reliable, it was retrained. In future the indication for hearing aids will be oriented towards the aid guidelines of the legal health insurance. The questionnaire for the expert opinion was revised and the fee was adapted."

The study consisted of two groups. Each group contained 109 men. Group I comprised veterans with normal hearing at the end of 1979 sino-vietnamese war. All these veterans were randomly selected from Guangzhou Military Command. Group II were men with no military experience randomly chosen from the health examination center of Guangzhou General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command. Pure-tone thresholds of these two groups were measured and compared. The pure-tone thresholds of Group I were poorer than those of Group II at the frequencies of 4, 6 and 8 kHz. Thus, impulse noise accelerates age-related hearing loss. "
"23819619","Speech-in-noise screening tests by internet, part 3: test sensitivity for uncontrolled parameters in domestic usage.","OBJECTIVE: The online speech-in-noise test 'Earcheck' is sensitive for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). This study investigates effects of uncontrollable parameters in domestic self-screening, such as presentation level and transducer type, on speech reception thresholds (SRTs) obtained with Earcheck.DESIGN: Subjects performed 26 Earchecks that differed regarding presentation level (65, 71, and 77 dBA), presentation mode (monotic or diotic), and masking noise (two different low-pass filtered noises) in the lab. To investigate effects of test environment, participants conducted eight additional Earchecks at home using different transducer types (headphones or loudspeakers).STUDY SAMPLE: Thirty noise-exposed workers, either normal-hearing (n = 10), or with different degrees of NIHL (n = 20), participated.RESULTS: There was a minor effect of presentation levels exceeding 65 dBA in severely impaired listeners. Diotic presentation mode yielded lower SRTs compared to monotic presentation mode. Normal-hearing test results at home were poorer than in the laboratory, whereas hearing-impaired subjects performed better in domestic testing. Using loudspeakers deteriorated SRTs significantly in comparison to headphones, but only in hearing-impaired subjects.CONCLUSIONS: A monotic presentation mode using headphones is recommended for domestic screening. Since domestic testing affects SRT results, a follow up study using a large study population should assess Earcheck's validity when performed at home."
"23782715","Efficient hearing screening in noise-exposed listeners using the digit triplet test.","OBJECTIVES: Hearing screening in occupational medicine is generally based on pure-tone threshold audiometry. However, reliable and valid thresholds can only be obtained in a sound-proof room, using a high-quality, well-calibrated audiometer, and by a well-trained administrator. Thresholds also need to be determined for several audiometric frequencies. This makes the test time-consuming and expensive, which is not ideal for the screening of large populations. A Speech-In-Noise test (SPIN), by contrast, does not have the abovementioned requirements. Because it can be implemented as a quick automated self-test, possibly over the Internet, a SPIN test is highly advantageous for screening purposes. However, its sensitivity for (isolated) high-frequency hearing loss, as typically seen in noise-exposed listeners, was unclear up to present. In this study, the authors investigated the sensitivity and specificity of the Digit Triplet SPIN test for detecting and monitoring (early-stage) high-frequency hearing loss, and its similarity across two different language versions.DESIGN: One-hundred eighteen noise-exposed workers, representing a wide range from no to severe high-frequency hearing loss, completed the French or Dutch version of the broadband Digit Triplet self-test in an office-like room. Pure-tone thresholds, collected by a professional audiologist in favorable settings, served as the reference.RESULTS: The 84 Dutch-speaking participants showed a very strong linear relation between the reference and the Digit Triplet test, with the pure-tone average at 2, 3, 4, and 6 kHz as a strong predictor (R = 0.86) for the speech-reception threshold. The sensitivity and specificity to detect mild high-frequency hearing loss were 92% (61 of 66) and 89% (16 of 18), respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was very high (=0.91) for several degrees of high-frequency hearing loss. With a within-subject standard deviation of only 0.8 dB, the Digit Triplet test also had a low measurement error. The results of the 34 French-speaking subjects showed a highly similar trend.CONCLUSIONS: The Digit Triplet test proves to have a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting different degrees of high-frequency hearing loss. Given its ease of use, this test is very suitable for screening purposes in occupational medicine, and potentially for the screening of adolescents at risk of recreational noise-induced hearing loss."
"23772828","The applicability of a speech-in-noise screening test in occupational hearing conservation.","OBJECTIVE: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is the most reported occupational health disease in the Netherlands. The internet-based speech-in-noise test Earcheck (Albrecht et al, 2005; Leensen et al, 2011b) is designed to detect beginning NIHL and can be a valuable tool in occupational hearing health surveillance. The aim of this study is to investigate the validity of Earcheck compared to regular screening audiometry.DESIGN: Subjects performed online Earcheck tests at home. The results are compared to a pure-tone screening audiogram obtained during regular occupational health examination. A subgroup performed the measurements twice to assess test-retest reliability.STUDY SAMPLE: Two hundred and forty-nine male construction employees who recently had a periodic occupational health examination participated.RESULTS: An average learning effect of -1.6 dB was found, that reduced with increasing test number. The test-retest variability was 1.6 dB. Sensitivity to detect beginning NIHL was 68%, with a specificity of 71%.CONCLUSIONS: Although sensitivity and specificity values are only moderate, the broad internet application still promises a valuable addition to current practice. The relatively high learning effect indicates that more reliable results can be obtained after a longer test session. When this is put into practice some improvement in sensitivity and specificity may be expected as well."
"23771423","Auditory risk assessment of college music students in jazz band-based instructional activity.","It is well-known that musicians are at risk for music-induced hearing loss, however, systematic evaluation of music exposure and its effects on the auditory system are still difficult to assess. The purpose of the study was to determine if college students in jazz band-based instructional activity are exposed to loud classroom noise and consequently exhibit acute but significant changes in basic auditory measures compared to non-music students in regular classroom sessions. For this we (1) measured and compared personal exposure levels of college students (n = 14) participating in a routine 50 min jazz ensemble-based instructional activity (experimental) to personal exposure levels of non-music students (n = 11) participating in a 50-min regular classroom activity (control), and (2) measured and compared pre- to post-auditory changes associated with these two types of classroom exposures. Results showed that the L eq (equivalent continuous noise level) generated during the 50 min jazz ensemble-based instructional activity ranged from 95 dBA to 105.8 dBA with a mean of 99.5 ± 2.5 dBA. In the regular classroom, the L eq ranged from 46.4 dBA to 67.4 dBA with a mean of 49.9 ± 10.6 dBA. Additionally, significant differences were observed in pre to post-auditory measures between the two groups. The experimental group showed a significant temporary threshold shift bilaterally at 4000 Hz (P &lt; 0.05), and a significant decrease in the amplitude of transient-evoked otoacoustic emission response in both ears (P &lt; 0.05) after exposure to the jazz ensemble-based instructional activity. No significant changes were found in the control group between pre- and post-exposure measures. This study quantified the noise exposure in jazz band-based practice sessions and its effects on basic auditory measures. Temporary, yet significant, auditory changes seen in music students place them at risk for hearing loss compared to their non-music cohorts."
"23691834","Occupational noise-induced hearing loss in Indian steel industry workers: an exploratory study.","OBJECTIVE: The present study focused on exploring the current level of hearing protection and subsequently determined the prevalence of occupational noise-induced hearing loss among casting and forging industry workers.BACKGROUND: The casting and forging industry provides employment to a significant portion of the population.METHOD: The level of hearing protection was assessed through questionnaire survey of 572 workers. Out of these workers, 165 and another control group of 57 participants were assessed by formal audiometry. Audiometric tests were conducted at frequencies of 1.0 KHz to 8.0 KHz.The occurrence of hearing loss was determined on the basis of a hearing threshold level with a low fence of 25 dB. Student's test and ANOVA were used to compare the various groups; a p value &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTS: More than 90% of the workers sampled showed significant hearing loss at medium and high frequencies. The analyses revealed a higher prevalence of significant hearing loss among the forging workers compared with the workers associated with the other activities.CONCLUSIONS: The workers of the Indian steel industry are highly exposed to occupational noise. The majority of workers are not protected from noise-induced hearing loss. There is a need to provide special ear protectors for workers engaged in forging. A complete hearing protection program, including training, audiometry, job rotation, and the use of hearing protection devices, needs to be introduced."

"23474376","Hearing risk associated with the usage of personal listening devices among urban high school students in Malaysia.","OBJECTIVES: To investigate listening habits and hearing risks associated with the use of personal listening devices among urban high school students in Malaysia.STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional, descriptive study.METHODS: In total, 177 personal listening device users (13-16 years old) were interviewed to elicit their listening habits (e.g. listening duration, volume setting) and symptoms of hearing loss. Their listening levels were also determined by asking them to set their usual listening volume on an Apple iPod TM playing a pre-selected song. The iPod's sound output was measured with an artificial ear connected to a sound level meter. Subjects also underwent pure tone audiometry to ascertain their hearing thresholds at standard frequencies (0.5-8 kHz) and extended high frequencies (9-16 kHz).RESULTS: The mean measured listening level and listening duration for all subjects were 72.2 dBA and 1.2 h/day, respectively. Their self-reported listening levels were highly correlated with the measured levels (P &lt; 0.001). Subjects who listened at higher volumes also tend to listen for longer durations (P = 0.012). Male subjects listened at a significantly higher volume than female subjects (P = 0.008). When sound exposure levels were compared with the recommended occupational noise exposure limit, 4.5% of subjects were found to be listening at levels which require mandatory hearing protection in the occupational setting. Hearing loss (=25 dB hearing level at one or more standard test frequencies) was detected in 7.3% of subjects. Subjects' sound exposure levels from the devices were positively correlated with their hearing thresholds at two of the extended high frequencies (11.2 and 14 kHz), which could indicate an early stage of noise-induced hearing loss.CONCLUSIONS: Although the average high school student listened at safe levels, a small percentage of listeners were exposed to harmful sound levels. Preventive measures are needed to avoid permanent hearing damage in high-risk listeners."

"23369841","Effects of chronic noise exposure on speech-in-noise perception in the presence of normal audiometry.","OBJECTIVE: To assess auditory processing in noise-exposed subjects with normal audiograms and compare the findings with those of non-noise-exposed normal controls.METHODS: Ten noise-exposed Royal Air Force aircrew pilots were compared with 10 Royal Air Force administrators who had no history of noise exposure. Participants were matched in terms of age and sex. The subjects were assessed in terms of: pure tone audiometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions, suppression of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions in contralateral noise and auditory processing task performance (i.e. masking, frequency discrimination, auditory attention and speech-in-noise).RESULTS: All subjects had normal pure tone audiometry and transient evoked otoacoustic emissions amplitudes in both ears. The noise-exposed aircrew had similar pure tone audiometry thresholds to controls, but right ear transient evoked otoacoustic emissions were larger and speech-in-noise thresholds were elevated in the noise-exposed subjects compared to controls.CONCLUSION: The finding of poorer speech-in-noise perception may reflect noise-related impairment of auditory processing in retrocochlear pathways. Audiometry may not detect early, significant noise-induced hearing impairment."
"23324255","Auditory dysfunction associated with solvent exposure.","BACKGROUND: A number of studies have demonstrated that solvents may induce auditory dysfunction. However, there is still little knowledge regarding the main signs and symptoms of solvent-induced hearing loss (SIHL). The aim of this research was to investigate the association between solvent exposure and adverse effects on peripheral and central auditory functioning with a comprehensive audiological test battery.METHODS: Seventy-two solvent-exposed workers and 72 non-exposed workers were selected to participate in the study. The test battery comprised pure-tone audiometry (PTA), transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE), Random Gap Detection (RGD) and Hearing-in-Noise test (HINT).RESULTS: Solvent-exposed subjects presented with poorer mean test results than non-exposed subjects. A bivariate and multivariate linear regression model analysis was performed. One model for each auditory outcome (PTA, TEOAE, RGD and HINT) was independently constructed. For all of the models solvent exposure was significantly associated with the auditory outcome. Age also appeared significantly associated with some auditory outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence of the possible adverse effect of solvents on the peripheral and central auditory functioning. A discussion of these effects and the utility of selected hearing tests to assess SIHL is addressed."
"24626978","Study of evoked otoacoustic emissions and suppression effect on workers exposed to pesticides and noise.","PURPOSE: To analyze the findings for Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (EOEA) and suppression effect in workers with normal hearing exposed to pesticides and noise .METHODS: The sample consisted of 55 participants with normal hearing, with ages ranging from 18 to 35 years, divided into two groups: one group exposed to noise and pesticides (GRA) and a control group (CG). The GRA was composed of 25 participants exposed to a representative average level of daily occupational noise exposure of 86 dBA and organophosphate-type pesticides, whereas the GC was composed of 30 participants who were not exposed to noise or pesticides. All participants underwent Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (TEOAE) and Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAE) examinations and research of the suppression effect.RESULTS: The findings revealed differences between the results of TEOAE and DPOAE exams between GRA and GC groups. GRA participants showed worse results in EOAE findings. Regarding the suppression effect, lesser effects were observed in the GRA.CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the study of EOAE and suppression effect can be used in early identification of hearing damage to workers simultaneously exposed to pesticides and noise."

These data support the use of noise bands, preferably ERB noises, as stimuli for audiometric monitoring."
"25515180","Is it reasonable to use 1 and 8 kHz anchor points in the medico-legal diagnosis and estimation of noise-induced hearing loss?","BACKGROUND: In the United Kingdom, use of 1 and 8 kHz as anchor point frequencies has been recommended for the medico-legal diagnosis and estimation of noise-induced hearing loss. There appear to be four assumptions behind the use of 1 and 8 kHz anchor point approach: (i) The frequencies of 1 and 8 kHz are not damaged by noise; therefore, the measured hearing thresholds at the said frequencies solely reflect age-related hearing loss, even in the noise-exposed; (ii) The hearing thresholds at 1 and 8 kHz are a valid predictor of the likely age-related hearing loss thresholds at the other frequencies; (iii) Age and noise damage are always completely additive; (iv) Individual's susceptibility to age and noise damage is not proportionate. Doubts have been expressed in the medical circles about the legitimacy and validity of their use as anchor points.OBJECTIVE OF REVIEW: Is it reasonable to use 1 and 8 kHz anchor points in the medico-legal diagnosis and estimation of noise-induced hearing loss?TYPE OF REVIEW: Medico-legal.SEARCH STRATEGY: Literature search; Medline, Embase, Internet, and medico-legal records.EVALUATION METHOD: Equating and comparing the assumptions in the anchor point approach with the information in medical literature.RESULTS: Based upon the information in medical literature, technical reports, and professional statements, the assumptions behind the use of anchor point approach cannot be reliably substantiated.CONCLUSIONS: 'Carte Blanche' use of 1 and 8 kHz anchor points is probably unreasonable and may well be unsafe in the medico-legal diagnosis and estimation of noise-induced hearing loss."
"25470622","Concurrent effect of noise exposure and smoking on extended high-frequency pure-tone thresholds.","OBJECTIVE: Concurrent effect of noise and smoking on hearing loss is a recent concern. In this study, the concurrent effect of noise and smoking on hearing loss in conventional frequencies and frequencies higher than 8 kHz was assessed.DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study on workers exposed to noise who were divided into two groups: smokers and non-smokers. Hearing thresholds were assessed by conventional audiometry, and HFA. Data were analysed using non-parametric tests and Student's t-test.STUDY SAMPLE: There were 212 workers.RESULTS: Ninety-seven subjects were smokers and 115 individuals were non-smokers. All subjects were exposed to 92.1 ± 2.4 dBA (Leq8h). The highest threshold in conventional and high-frequency audiometry was observed at 6 kHz and 16 kHz, respectively. Hearing threshold at frequencies above 1 kHz was significantly higher in the smokers than non-smokers. There was no correlation between hearing thresholds and pack-years of smoking.CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent exposure to noise and smoking may be associated with more hearing loss than exposure to noise alone in the conventional and high frequencies. However, other differences between smokers and non-smokers may explain these differences as well."
"25470371","The prevalence of notched audiograms in a cross-sectional study of 12,055 railway workers.","OBJECTIVE: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is one of the most reported occupational diseases internationally. The occurrence of audiometric notches is emphasized in both American and European guidelines for the diagnosis of NIHL. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of notched audiograms among railway personnel with and without noise exposure to better assess the usefulness of such notches in the diagnosis of NIHL.DESIGN: The most recent audiogram from 1994 to 2011 of a total of 12,055 railway workers, age 20 to 65 years, was obtained from the medical records of the occupational health service of the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). The prevalences of three types of notched audiograms, Coles notch, notch index, and 4 kHz notch, were computed, in relation to age, sex, and occupational noise exposure.RESULTS: Coles notch in either ear was found in 63% of the male railway maintenance workers, exposed to noise levels of 75 to 90 dB(A), compared with 53% of the non-noise exposed (&lt;70 dB(A)) traffic controllers (p &lt; 0.001). The corresponding figures for the 4 kHz notch were 31% versus 21% (p &lt; 0.001). For the notch index, 61% of the exposed and 51% of the controls had a notched audiogram (p &lt; 0.001). For female workers, the prevalence of audiometric notches was lower, and the differences between noise exposed and nonexposed was smaller than those in men. Increasing age led to an increased prevalence of notches.CONCLUSIONS: Audiometric notches commonly occur among both noise-exposed and those not exposed to noise in railway personnel. The usefulness of audiometric notches in the diagnosis of NIHL is therefore limited."
"25421175","Effective identification of functional hearing loss using behavioral threshold measures.","PURPOSE: Four functional hearing loss protocols were evaluated.METHOD: For each protocol, 30 participants feigned a hearing loss first on an audiogram and then for a screening test that began a threshold search from extreme levels (-10 or 90 dB HL). Two-tone and 3-tone protocols compared thresholds for ascending and descending tones for 2 (0.5 and 1.0 kHz) and 3 (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 kHz) frequencies, respectively. A noise-band protocol compared an ascending noise-band threshold with that for 2 descending tones (0.5 and 1.0 kHz). A spondee protocol compared an ascending spondee threshold with that for 2 descending tones (0.5 and 1.0 kHz). These measures were repeated without the participants feigning losses.RESULTS: With nonfeigning participants, ascending and descending threshold differences were minimal for all protocols. When the participants feigned a loss, the spondee protocol produced the largest average threshold difference (30.8 dB), whereas the other protocols produced smaller differences (19.6-22.2 dB).CONCLUSIONS: Using both the screening test and a comparison of the initial audiogram with the screening test, the spondee and 3-tone protocols resulted in 100% true positives and 0% false positives for functional hearing loss. Either of these protocols could be used clinically or in occupational hearing conservation programs."
"25387537","A comparison of the effects of solvent and noise exposure on hearing, together and separately.","The objective of the present study was to assess the effects of occupational exposure to noise and organic solvents on hearing loss in bus and truck plant workers. Our case control study contained 469 workers from a bus and truck plant divided into three groups. The first group contained workers exposed to only noise; the second group contained workers exposed to both noise and mixture solvents at a permissible level; and the third group included workers exposed to permissible levels of solvents. The control group (Group 4) included 119 individuals selected randomly, persons who were not exposed to noise and solvents. These groups were compared in terms of each individual's frequency hearing loss in both ears. Our study demonstrates that combined exposure to mixed solvents and noise can exacerbate hearing loss in workers. Hence, a suitable hearing protection program is advised that would contain short-interval audiometric examinations and efficient hearing protectors. "

These pilots were subjected to audiometric examinations for obtaining or revalidating the functional capacity certificate in 2011. The degree of hearing loss was classified as normal, suspected noise-induced hearing loss, and no suspected hearing loss with other associated complications. Pure-tone air-conduction audiometry was performed using supra-aural headphones and acoustic stimulus of the pure-tone type, containing tone thresholds of frequencies between 250 Hz and 6,000 Hz. The independent variables were professional categories, length of service, hours of flight, and right or left ear. The dependent variable was pilots with suspected noise-induced hearing loss. The noise exposure level was considered low/medium or high, and the latter involved periods &gt; 5,000 flight hours and &gt; 10 years of flight service.RESULTS: A total of 29.3% pilots had suspected noise-induced hearing loss, which was bilateral in 12.8% and predominant in the left ear (23.7%). The number of pilots with suspected hearing loss increased as the noise exposure level increased.CONCLUSIONS: Hearing loss in civilian pilots may be associated with noise exposure during the period of service and hours of flight."

"25324318","A cross-sectional study of hearing thresholds among 4627 Norwegian train and track maintenance workers.","OBJECTIVE: Railway workers performing maintenance work of trains and tracks could be at risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss, since they are exposed to noise levels of 75-90 dB(A) with peak exposures of 130-140 dB(C). The objective was to make a risk assessment by comparing the hearing thresholds among train and track maintenance workers with a reference group not exposed to noise and reference values from the ISO 1999.DESIGN: Cross-sectional.SETTING: A major Norwegian railway company.PARTICIPANTS: 1897 and 2730 male train and track maintenance workers, respectively, all exposed to noise, and 2872 male railway traffic controllers and office workers not exposed to noise.OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the hearing threshold (pure tone audiometry, frequencies from 0.5 to 8 kHz), and the secondary outcome was the prevalence of audiometric notches (Coles notch) of the most recent audiogram.RESULTS: Train and track maintenance workers aged 45 years or older had a small mean hearing loss in the 3-6 kHz area of 3-5 dB. The hearing loss was less among workers younger than 45 years. Audiometric notches were slightly more prevalent among the noise exposed (59-64%) group compared with controls (49%) for all age groups. They may therefore be a sensitive measure in disclosing an early hearing loss at a group level.CONCLUSIONS: Train and track maintenance workers aged 45 years or older, on average, have a slightly greater hearing loss and more audiometric notches compared with reference groups not exposed to noise. Younger (&lt;45 years) workers have hearing thresholds comparable to the controls."
"25320701","Effect of exposure to a mixture of organic solvents on hearing thresholds in petrochemical industry workers.","INTRODUCTION: Hearing loss is one of the most common occupational diseases. In most workplaces, workers are exposed to noise and solvents simultaneously, so the potential risk of hearing loss due to solvents may be attributed to noise. In this study we aimed to assess the effect of exposure to mixed aromatic solvents on hearing in the absence of exposure to hazardous noise.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 99 workers from the petrochemical industry with exposure to a mixture of organic solvents whose noise exposure was lower than 85 dBA were compared with 100 un-exposed controls. After measuring sound pressure level and mean concentration of each solvent in the workplace, pure-tone-audiometry was performed and the two groups were compared in terms of high-frequency and low-frequency hearing loss. T-tests and Chi-square tests were used to compare the two groups.RESULTS: The mean hearing threshold at all frequencies among petrochemical workers was normal (below 25 dB). We did not observe any significant association between solvent exposure and high-frequency or low-frequency hearing loss.CONCLUSION: This study showed that temporary exposure (less than 4 years) to a mixture of organic solvents, without exposure to noise, does not affect workers' hearing threshold in audiometry tests."

The involvement of inflammation in this condition has been suggested.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between interleukin - 6 (IL-6) polymorphism and susceptibility to NIHL.METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with a sample of 191 independent elderly individuals aged &gt;60 years of age. Information on exposure to occupational noise was obtained by interviews. Audiological evaluation was performed using pure tone audiometry and genotyped through PCR by restriction fragment length polymorphism - PCR-RFLP. Data were analyzed using the chi-square test and the odds ratio (OR), with the significance level set at 5%.RESULTS: Among elderly with hearing loss (78.0%), 18.8% had a history of exposure to occupational noise. There was a statistically significant association between the genotype frequencies of the IL-6 -174 and NIHL. The elderly with the CC genotype were less likely to have hearing loss due to occupational noise exposure when compared to those carrying the GG genotype (OR=0.0124; 95% CI 0.0023-0.0671; p&lt;0.001).CONCLUSION: This study suggests there is an association of polymorphisms in the IL-6 gene at position - G174C with susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss."

Hearing loss was defined as hearing threshold levels =25 dB in either ear at the frequencies 3,000, 4,000 or 6,000 Hz. Hearing thresholds were adjusted for age and gender using ISO 7029.RESULTS: The prevalence of hearing loss among Navy personnel was 31.4 %. The work exposure variables: years of work in the Navy, years on vessel(s) in the Navy and years of sailing in the Navy were associated with reduced hearing after adjusting for age, gender and otitis as an adult. Among the work exposure variables, years of sailing in the Navy was the strongest predictor of reduced hearing, and significantly reduced hearing was found at the frequencies 1,000, 3,000 and 4,000 Hz.CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that time spent on board vessels in the RNoN is a predictor of reduced hearing."
"25205300","3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging noise in standard head and neck sequence does not cause temporary threshold shift in high frequency.","High acoustic noise level is one of the unavoidable side effects of 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A case of hearing loss after 3 T MRI has been reported in this institution and hence this study. The objective of this study was to determine whether temporary threshold shift (TTS) in high frequency hearing occurs in patients undergoing 3 T MRI scans of the head and neck. A total of 35 patients undergoing head and neck 3 T MRI for various clinical indications were tested with pure tone audiometry in different frequencies including high frequencies, before and after the MRI scan. Any threshold change from the recorded baseline of 10 dB was considered significant. All patients were fitted with foamed 3 M earplugs before the procedure following the safety guidelines for 3 T MRI. The mean time for MRI procedure was 1,672 s (range 1,040-2,810). The noise dose received by each patient amounted to an average of 3,906.29% (1,415-9,170%). The noise dose was derived from a normograph used by Occupational Noise Surveys. This was calculated using the nomograph of L eq, L EX, noise dose and time. There was no statistically significant difference between the hearing threshold before and after the MRI procedures for all the frequencies (paired t test, P &gt; 0.05). For patients using 3 M foamed earplugs, noise level generated by 3 T MRI during routine clinical sequence did not cause any TTS in high frequency hearing."
"25201133",NA,"OBJECTIVE: 'Acoustic Shock' injury has arisen with the proliferation of telephone-based employment but is not yet fully understood. This study aimed to further characterize this phenomenon by reviewing the current literature and analysing a case series.DESIGN: Cases were identified from medicolegal and clinical practice. Case notes, including General Practitioner and occupational health records where available, were scrutinised and information on demographics and medical history obtained. Patients underwent interview, examination, and pure-tone audiometry.STUDY SAMPLE: Thirty cases were included. Eighteen (60%) were female. Mean age was 41.6 years.RESULTS: There was a range of otological symptoms (mean 3.2 per patient), most commonly tinnitus which was present in 27 (90%), accompanied by diverse non-otological symptoms. Twenty-one (70%) had previous oto-pathology, 19 (63%) psychopathology, and five (17%) head injury. Examination was normal in 28 (93%), as was audiometry in 13 (43%). Eleven (50%) smoked. Hearing loss was not necessarily a feature.CONCLUSIONS: The condition known as 'acoustic shock' injury is a complex disorder producing a range of symptoms with psychological overlay. However, there is often little clinical evidence of pathology and it has not been adequately defined as yet. By further characterization, epidemiology and aetiology can be better understood."
"25188429","Noise-induced hearing loss: an occupational medicine perspective.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Up to 30 million workers in the United States are exposed to potentially detrimental levels of noise. Although reliable medications for minimizing or reversing noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) are not currently available, NIHL is entirely preventable. The purpose of this article is to review the epidemiology and pathophysiology of occupational NIHL. We will focus on at-risk populations and discuss prevention programs. Current prevention programs focus on reducing inner ear damage by minimizing environmental noise production and through the use of personal hearing protective devices.RECENT FINDINGS: NIHL is the result of a complex interaction between environmental factors and patient factors, both genetic and acquired. The effects of noise exposure are specific to an individual. Trials are currently underway evaluating the role of antioxidants in protection from, and even reversal of, NIHL.SUMMARY: Occupational NIHL is the most prevalent occupational disease in the United States. Occupational noise exposures may contribute to temporary or permanent threshold shifts, although even temporary threshold shifts may predispose an individual to eventual permanent hearing loss. Noise prevention programs are paramount in reducing hearing loss as a result of occupational exposures."
"25033789","Comparison of the effects of N-acetyl-cysteine and ginseng in prevention of noise induced hearing loss in male textile workers.","Previous studies revealed the role of antioxidant agents in prevention of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL). The aim of this study was to compare the protective effect of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and ginseng on protection of NIHL in textile workers exposed to continuous noise in daily working. In this study, 48 participants were randomly allocated to three groups; Group I received NAC 1200 mg/day, Group II received ginseng 200 mg/day, and Group III (control group) received no supplement. Pure tone audiometry and high frequency audiometry were performed preshift before and after 14 days (on day 15). Linear regression analysis results showed reduced noise-induced temporary threshold shift (TTS) for NAC and ginseng groups at 4, 6 and 16 kHz (P &lt; 0.001) in both ears. Furthermore, the protective effects were more prominent in NAC than ginseng. Our results show that NAC and ginseng can reduce noise induced TTS in workers exposed to occupational noise. Further studies are needed to prove antioxidants benefits in hearing conservation programs. "
"25029581","Noise-induced tinnitus: auditory evoked potential in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.","OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the central auditory pathways in workers with noise-induced tinnitus with normal hearing thresholds, compared the auditory brainstem response results in groups with and without tinnitus and correlated the tinnitus location to the auditory brainstem response findings in individuals with a history of occupational noise exposure.METHOD: Sixty individuals participated in the study and the following procedures were performed: anamnesis, immittance measures, pure-tone air conduction thresholds at all frequencies between 0.25-8 kHz and auditory brainstem response.RESULTS: The mean auditory brainstem response latencies were lower in the Control group than in the Tinnitus group, but no significant differences between the groups were observed. Qualitative analysis showed more alterations in the lower brainstem in the Tinnitus group. The strongest relationship between tinnitus location and auditory brainstem response alterations was detected in individuals with bilateral tinnitus and bilateral auditory brainstem response alterations compared with patients with unilateral alterations.CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest the occurrence of a possible dysfunction in the central auditory nervous system (brainstem) in individuals with noise-induced tinnitus and a normal hearing threshold."

The control group (n<U+200A>=<U+200A>161) was exposed to noise intensity &lt;85 dB and the exposed group (n<U+200A>=<U+200A>217) was exposed to noise intensity <U+2267>85 dB. A polymerase chain reaction was used to differentiate the various genotypes of ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) and ACE G2350A.RESULTS: Noise significantly increased the likelihood of hypertension. Carriers of the genotypes AG, GG, and DD were vulnerable to hypertension on noise exposure. No association between hypertension and hearing impairment or noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) was found.CONCLUSION: Our results support the association between ACE gene polymorphisms and occurrence of hypertension in noise-exposed workers."
"24953884","Occupational hearing loss of market mill workers in the city of Accra, Ghana.","Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) is an irreversible sensorineural hearing loss associated with exposure to high levels of excessive noise. Prevention measures are not well established in developing countries. This comparative cross sectional study aims to determine the prevalence of hearing loss in both a group of high risk workers and a control group and to assess their knowledge of the effects of noise on hearing health. A total of 101 market mill workers and 103 controls employed within markets in the city of Accra, Ghana, were evaluated using a structured questionnaire and pure tone audiometry. The questionnaire assessed factors including self-reported hearing loss, tinnitus, knowledge on the effects of noise on hearing health and the use of hearing protective devices. Pure tone audiometric testing was conducted for both mill workers and controls. Noise levels at the work premises of the mill workers and controls were measured. Symptoms of hearing loss were reported by 24 (23.76%) and 8 (7.7%) mill workers and controls respectively. Fifty-five (54.5%) and fifty-four (52.37%) mill workers and controls exhibited knowledge of the effects of noise on hearing health. Five (5.0%) mill workers used hearing protective devices. There was significant sensorineural hearing loss and the presence of a 4 kHz audiometric notch among mill workers when compared with controls for the mean thresholds of 2 kHz, 3 kHz and 4 kHz (P = 0. 001). The prevalence of hearing loss in the better hearing ears of the mill workers and controls was 24.8% and 4.8% respectively (P &lt; 0.5). The prevalence of hearing loss, which may be characteristic of NIHL in the better hearing ears of the mill workers and controls was 24.8% and 4.8% respectively.

"24923465","High-frequency hearing thresholds: effects of age, occupational ultrasound and noise exposure.","PURPOSE: It has been suggested that high-frequency audiometry (HFA) could represent a useful preventive measure in exposed workers. The aim was to investigate the effects of age, ultrasound and noise on high-frequency hearing thresholds.METHODS: We tested 24 industrial ultrasound-exposed subjects, 113 industrial noise-exposed subjects and 148 non-exposed subjects. Each subject was tested with both conventional-frequency (0.125-8 kHz) and high-frequency (9-18 kHz) audiometry.RESULTS: The hearing threshold at high frequency deteriorated as a function of age, especially in subjects more than 30 years old. The ultrasound-exposed subjects had significantly higher hearing thresholds than the non-exposed ones at the high frequencies, being greatest from 10 to 14 kHz. This hearing loss was already significantly evident in subjects with exposure &lt;5 years and increased with years of exposure and advancing age. The noise exposure group had significantly higher hearing thresholds than the non-exposed group at the conventional frequencies 4 and 6 kHz and at the high frequency of 14 kHz. After stratification for age, there was a significant difference between the two groups at 9-10 and 14-15 kHz only for those under 30 years of age.CONCLUSION: Multivariate analysis indicated that age was the primary predictor, and noise and ultrasound exposure the secondary predictors of hearing thresholds in the high-frequency range. The results suggest that HFA could be useful in the early diagnosis of noise-induced hearing loss in younger groups of workers (under 30 years of age)."

Despite regulations and preventive measures, noise-induced hearing loss is common. The current reference test is pure-tone air-conduction audiometry (PTA), but this test cannot be used to detect early hearing loss.OBJECTIVE: In this study, we assess one-day auditory fatigue using both PTA and efferent reflexes (ER) measured using DPOAEs associated with contralateral acoustic stimulation (CAS DPOAEs).DESIGN: The noise exposure history, PTA, and ER detection were performed in seven different companies where the L(EX,8h) was 85 dB(A). Hearing was tested before and at the end of the working day.STUDY SAMPLE: Forty-six volunteers were selected to carry out this study.RESULTS: After a single working day, a greater impact of noise was measured using ER thresholds than PTA or DPOAEs. ER measurements are objective, easy to perform, and do not require a sound-attenuated booth.CONCLUSION: Screening workers by periodically measuring ER thresholds using CAS DPOAEs helps detect early changes in hearing status, before the onset of noise-induced hearing loss. These tests can be readily applied as part of a hearing conservation program."

"24708640","Using prophylactic antioxidants to prevent noise-induced hearing damage in young adults: a protocol for a double-blind, randomized controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: During leisure activities young people are often exposed to excessive noise levels resulting in an increase of noise-induced symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus and hyperacusis. Noise-induced tinnitus is often perceived after loud music exposure and provides an important marker for overexposure as a temporary threshold shift that is often not experienced by the individual itself. As oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of noise-induced hearing loss, the use of antioxidants to prevent hearing damage has recently become the subject of research.METHODS: This study proposes a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial to assess the effects of a prophylactic combination of N-acetylcysteine (600 mg) and magnesium (200 mg) prior to leisure noise exposure in young adults. The primary outcome measure is the tinnitus loudness scored by a visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary outcome measures are the differences in audiological measurements for the antioxidant treatments compared to placebo intake. Audiological testing comprising of pure tone audiometry including frequencies up to 16 kHz, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions and speech-in-noise testing will be performed prior to and within 7 hours after noise exposure. By use of a mixed effects statistical model, the effects of antioxidants compared to placebo intake will be assessed.DISCUSSION: As adolescents and young adults often do not use hearing protection while being exposed to loud music, the use of preventive antioxidant intake may provide a useful and harmless way to prevent noise-induced hearing damage in this population. Furthermore, when exposed to hazardous noise levels the protection provided by hearing protectors might not be sufficient to prevent hearing damage and antioxidants may provide additive otoprotective effects. Previous research mainly focused on occupational noise exposure. The present study provides a protocol to assess the usefulness of antioxidants during leisure noise activities.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The present protocol is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01727492."

Prevalence and adjusted prevalence ratios for NSTS were estimated by industry. NSTS, OSTS, and OSTS-A prevalences were compared by industry.RESULTS: Twenty percent of workers had an NSTS, 14% had an OSTS, and 6% had an OSTS-A. For most industries, the OSTS and OSTS-A criteria identified 28% to 36% and 66% to 74% fewer workers than the NSTS criteria, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Use of NSTS criteria allowing for earlier detection of shifts in hearing is recommended for improved prevention of occupational hearing loss."

The field intensity indicator and noise analyzer were employed for the examination of the electromagnetic energy intensity and noise value at the working sites. Self-administered questionnaires were adopted. Universal hearing screening by distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) and pure tone audiometry (PTA) were done. 100 workers who had abnormal POAE were taken as the observation group and 100 workers who had normal DPOAE were taken as the control group. The workers need be confirmed with ABR testing when the pure tone threshold of two consecutive frequencies were above 20 dB HL or DPOAE detection in any frequency did not pass. Multiple factor analysis with logistic regression was performed for the risk factors.RESULT: The average electric power density in job locations was 21-38 KV/m, which was higher than national standard (&lt; 5 kv/m). Average noise-level in job locations was 52-65 dBHL, which was within the standard (&lt; 85 dB(A). Questionnaire presented that low frequency electric and magnetic fields might increase the incidence of headache, insomnia and tinnitus in the observed group. The incidence of abnormal DPOAE was higher in the subjects of the observed group (P &lt; 0.01). At 676, 933, 3616, 5 130, 7253 Hz, the DPOAE amplitudes of the observed group workers were significantly lower than the control group. Multivariate analysis showed that the risk factors of abnormal DPOAE included exposure of EMF, length of service, daily exposure time, conservatory measures might be protective factors.CONCLUSION: The changes of DPOAE indicated that the exposure to low frequency electric and magnetic fields had a subtle, discreet and localized impairing effects on outer hair cells. Exposure of low frequency electric and magnetic fields, length of service, daily exposure time might be risk factors, conservatory measures might be protective factors."
"24610168","Longitudinal changes in hearing threshold levels of noise-exposed construction workers.","PURPOSE: Longitudinal analysis of audiometric data of a large population of noise-exposed workers provides insight into the development of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) as a function of noise exposure and age, particularly during the first decade of noise exposure.METHODS: Data of pure-tone audiometry of 17,930 construction workers who underwent periodic occupational hearing screening at least twice during a 4-year period were available for analysis. These concerned all follow-up measurements of the baseline cohort described by Leensen et al. (Int Arch Occup Environ Health 84:577-590, 2011). Linear mixed models explored the relationship between the annual rate of change in hearing and noise exposure level, exposure duration, and age. Data of 3,111 workers who were tested on three occasions were used to investigate the pattern of hearing loss development.RESULTS: The mean annual deterioration in hearing in this study population was 0.54 dB/yr, and this became larger with increasing noise exposure level and increasing age. Remarkably, during the first decade of noise exposure, an improvement in hearing threshold levels (HTLs) was observed. The change in hearing over three measurements showed a concave development of hearing loss as a function of time, which corresponds to NIHL development.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, hearing deteriorated over the measurement period. Because HTLs at follow-up were better than those obtained at baseline, no statement can be made about the NIHL development during the first decade of noise exposure. This improvement in HTLs rather resembles the result of measurement variation in occupational screening audiometry than an actual improvement in hearing ability."

Five measurement visits were completed by participants within 14 days.RESULTS: The 50% critical difference boundaries were - 5 and 0 dB at 4 kHz and below and - 5 and 5 dB at 6 and 8 kHz. The likelihood of spurious notches due to test-retest variability was substantially lower than the likelihood of failing to detect a notched configuration when present. Correlates of variability included stimulus frequency, baseline threshold, acoustic reflectance of the ear, average noise exposure during the previous eight hours, age, and the tester's level of education in audiology.CONCLUSION: The short-term variability in 8-kHz pure-tone thresholds obtained with the TDH-39P earphone was slightly greater than at other frequencies, but this difference was not large enough to justify the disadvantages stemming from the inability to detect a 6-kHz notch."

On each trial, either wearing a device or with open ears, subjects walked along a 3000-foot line of discrete distance markers toward the auditory threat, which was not visible but still within line-of-sight over flat terrain, stopping to listen when instructed. On approach to the threat, the linear distance at first detection was measured, followed by a continued approach until positive identification occurred. Then the subject reversed direction, retreating away from the threat until detection was lost.RESULTS: ANOVA and post hoc tests were applied to determine statistically-significant differences among HPEDs, TCAPS, and the open ear on the objective detection and identification distance measures.CONCLUSIONS: The results have serious implications for selection of HPDs, HPEDs, and TCAPS for applications where preservation of auditory situational awareness via the fundamental detection and identification tasks are essential."
"24472221","Relationship of cigarette smoking and hearing loss in workers exposed to occupational noise.","OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of smoking on hearing loss among workers exposed to occupational noise.METHODS: From the results of a special workers health examination performed in 2011, we enrolled 8,543 subjects exposed to occupational noise and reviewed the findings. Using self-reported questionnaires and health examination results, we collected data on age, smoking status, disease status, height, weight, and biochemistry and pure tone audiometry findings. We divided the workers into 3 groups according to smoking status (non-smoker, ex-smoker, current smoker). Current smokers (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>3,593) were divided into 4 groups according to smoking amount (0.05-9.9, 10-19.9, 20-29.9, =30 pack-years). We analyzed the data to compare hearing thresholds between smoking statuses using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) after controlling for confounder effects.RESULTS: According to ANCOVA, the hearing thresholds of current smokers at 2 k, 3 k, and 4 kHz were significantly higher than that of the other groups. Multiple logistic regression for smoking status (reference: non-smokers) showed that the adjusted odds ratios of current smokers were 1.291 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.055-1.580), 1.180 (95% CI: 1.007-1.383), 1.295 (95% CI: 1.125-1.491), and 1.321 (95% CI: 1.157-1.507) at 1 k, 2 k, 3 k, and 4 kHz, respectively. Based on smoking amount, the adjusted odds ratios were 1.562 (95% CI: 1.013-2.408) and 1.643 (95% CI: 1.023-2.640) for the 10-19.9 and =30 pack-years group, respectively, at 1 kHz (reference: 0.05-9.9 pack-years). At 2 kHz, the adjusted odds ratios were increased statistically significantly with smoking amount for all groups. At all frequencies tested, the hearing thresholds of noise-exposed workers were significantly influenced by current smoking, in particular, the increase of hearing loss at low frequencies according to smoking amount was more prevalent.CONCLUSIONS: Current smoking significantly influenced hearing loss at all frequencies in workers exposed to occupational noise, and heavier smoking influenced low-frequency hearing loss more greatly. There was a dose-response relationship between smoking amount and low-frequency hearing thresholds; however, this was not observed for high-frequency hearing thresholds. Therefore, well-designed prospective studies are needed to clarify the effects of smoking on the degree of hearing loss."
"25812386","The influence of jet engine noise on hearing of technical staff.","BACKGROUND: Due to high sound pressure levels (SPLs), noise produced by jet planes may be harmful to hearing of people working in their proximity. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of exposure to jet engine noise on technical staff hearing.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprised 60 men, aged 24-50 years, employed in army as technical staff and exposed to jet engine noise for 6-20 years. The control group were 50 non-noise exposed males, aged 25-51 years. Exposure to noise emitted by jet engines was evaluated. Pure-tone audiometry (PTA) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) were recorded in both groups.RESULTS: Jet engines emitted broadband noise with spectrum dominated by components in the frequency range 315-6300 Hz (1/3-octave bands). Maximum A-weighted SPL during tests reached values of approx. 120-130 dB. Consequently, engine-servicing personnel (even in the case of a single engine test) was exposed to noise (at A-weighted daily noise exposure level above 95 dB) exceeding permissible levels. Averaged audiometric hearing threshold levels of technical staff were higher (= 17 dB HL, p &lt; 0.001) than in the control group. Similarly, the DPOAE amplitude was lower (= 17 dB SPL, p &lt; 0.01) in the noise-exposed subjects compared to the non-exposed ones. Significant reduction of DPOAE levels was mainly noted for high frequencies (3-6 kHz).CONCLUSIONS: Despite the usage of hearing protection devices, both PTA and DPOAE consistently showed poorer hearing in engine-servicing personnel vs. control group."

The aim of this study was to identify the relationship between arsenic exposure and hearing loss by measuring blood arsenic concentrations and hearing among miners.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This research is a retrospective case control study. Included in the study were miners employed in a single silver mine whose blood arsenic concentrations were high. A comparison was made on the pure tone audiometry measurements taken from miners exposed only to arsenic (Group 1), those exposed to both arsenic and noise (Group 2) and a control group exposed to neither arsenic nor noise (Group 3).RESULTS: It was found that for both ears at all frequencies, the hearing level of Group 3 was better than the hearing levels of both Group 1 and Group 2. There was no correlation between the blood arsenic levels and hearing levels in both ears.CONCLUSION: This study has revealed the ototoxic effects of arsenic. As blood arsenic concentrations do not reflect long-term exposure, no correlation was identified between blood arsenic concentrations and hearing levels. Further studies will be needed to clarify the mechanisms involved in the effect of arsenic on hearing. This paper represents the largest study to date focusing on the isolated effects of arsenic on hearing through the use of a clinical auditory test."
"26642893","Cardiovascular risk factors and hearing loss: The HUNT study.","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present paper was to examine the association between prospectively and cross-sectionally assessed cardiovascular risk factors and hearing loss.DESIGN: Hearing was assessed by pure-tone average thresholds at low (0.25-0.5 kHz), middle (1-2 kHz), and high (3-8 kHz) frequencies. Self-reported or measured cardiovascular risk factors were assessed both 11 years before and simultaneously with the audiometric assessment. Cardiovascular risk factors were smoking, alcohol use, physical inactivity, waist circumference, body mass index, resting heart rate, blood pressure, triglycerides, total serum cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and diabetes.STUDY SAMPLE: A population-based cohort of 31 547 subjects.RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, level of education, income, recurrent ear infections, and noise exposure, risk factors associated with poorer hearing sensitivity were smoking, diabetes, physical inactivity, resting heart rate, and waist circumference. Smoking was only associated with hearing loss at high frequencies. The effects were very small, in combination explaining only 0.2-0.4% of the variance in addition to the component explained by age and the other cofactors.CONCLUSION: This cohort study indicates that, although many cardiovascular risk factors are associated with hearing loss, the effects are small and of doubtful clinical relevance."

A further objective was to assess related factors such as exposure, instrument category, and the preventive effect of hearing protection. The study was a cross-sectional survey of rock musicians selected at random from a defined cohort of musicians. A random control group was included for comparison. We recruited 111 active musicians from the Oslo region, and a control group of 40 nonmusicians from the student population at the University of TromsØ. The subjects were investigated using clinical examination, pure tone audiometry, tympanometry, and a questionnaire. We observed a hearing loss in 37.8% of the rock musicians. Significantly poorer hearing thresholds were seen at most pure-tone frequencies in musicians than controls, with the most pronounced threshold shift at 6 kHz. The use of hearing protection, in particular custom-fitted earplugs, has a preventive effect but a minority of rock musicians apply them consistently. The degree of musical performance exposure was inversely related to the degree of hearing loss in our sample. Bass and guitar players had higher hearing thresholds than vocalists. We observed a 20% prevalence of chronic tinnitus but none of the affected musicians had severe tinnitus symptomatology. There was no statistical association between permanent tinnitus and hearing loss in our sample. We observed an increased prevalence of hearing loss and tinnitus in our sample of Norwegian rock musicians but the causal relationship between musical exposure and hearing loss or tinnitus is ambiguous. We recommend the use of hearing protection in rock musicians. "

Individual pure tone audiometry thresholds were compared with distortion product otoacoustic emission amplitudes, and a correlation of these measurements was conducted.RESULTS: Pure tone audiometry threshold elevation was identified in 13 out of 16 workers. When distortion product otoacoustic emission amplitudes were compared with pure tone audiometry thresholds at matched frequencies, no evidence of a robust relationship was apparent. Seven out of 16 workers had substantial distortion product otoacoustic emissions with elevated pure tone audiometry thresholds.CONCLUSION: No clinically relevant predictive relationship between distortion product otoacoustic emission amplitude and pure tone audiometry threshold was apparent. These results do not support the replacement of pure tone audiometry with distortion product otoacoustic emissions in screening. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions at frequencies associated with elevated pure tone audiometry thresholds are evidence of intact outer hair cell function, suggesting that sites distinct from these contribute to auditory deficit following ototrauma."

Clinical validity was determined by comparing air- and bone-conduction thresholds obtained inside and outside the sound booth (23 subjects).STUDY SAMPLE: Twenty-three normal-hearing subjects (age range, 20-75 years; average age 35.5) and a sub group of 11 subjects to establish test-retest reliability.RESULTS: Improved passive attenuation and valid environmental noise monitoring was demonstrated. Clinically, air-conduction thresholds inside and outside the sound booth, corresponded within 5 dB or less &gt; 90% of instances (mean absolute difference 3.3 ± 3.2 SD). Bone conduction thresholds corresponded within 5 dB or less in 80% of comparisons between test environments, with a mean absolute difference of 4.6 dB (3.7 SD). Threshold differences were not statistically significant. Mean absolute test-retest differences outside the sound booth was similar to those in the booth.CONCLUSION: Diagnostic pure-tone audiometry outside a sound booth, using automated testing, improved passive attenuation, and real-time environmental noise monitoring demonstrated reliable hearing assessments."
"26502292","Asymmetric Hearing Loss in Chinese Workers Exposed to Complex Noise.","OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the audiometric asymmetry in Chinese industrial workers and investigate the effects of noise exposure, sex, and binaural average thresholds on audiometric asymmetry.DESIGN: Data collected from Chinese industrial workers during a cross-sectional study were reanalyzed. Of the 1388 workers, 266 met the inclusion criteria for this study. Each subject underwent a physical examination and an otologic examination and completed a health-related questionnaire. <U+03C7> and t tests were used to examine the differences between the asymmetric and symmetric hearing loss groups.RESULTS: One hundred thirty-one subjects (49.2%) had a binaural hearing threshold difference of 15 dB or more for at least one frequency, and there was no statistically significant difference between the left and right ears. The asymmetric hearing loss group was not exposed to higher cumulative noise levels (t = 0.522, p = 0.602), and there was no dose-response relation between asymmetry and cumulative noise levels (<U+03C7> = 6.502, p = 0.165). Men were 1.849 times more likely to have asymmetry than women were (95% confidence interval, 1.051 to 3.253). Among the workers with higher high-frequency hearing thresholds, audiometric asymmetry was 1.024 times more prevalent than that among those with lower high-frequency hearing thresholds (95% confidence interval, 1.004 to 1.044).CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that occupational noise exposure contributed minimally to asymmetry, whereas sex and binaural average thresholds significantly affected audiometric asymmetry. There was no evidence that the left ears were worse than the right ears."
"26443047","Is this STS work-related? ISO 1999 predictions as an adjunct to clinical judgment.","BACKGROUND: Physicians and audiologists are often asked to decide whether standard threshold shifts (STSs) are work-related; epidemiological data can inform these decisions.METHODS: Predictions of ISO (2013) for both age-related and noise-induced threshold shifts, for the 2, 3, and 4 kHz average used in calculating OSHA STSs, are presented, in tables, graphs, and an Excel spreadsheet calculator. Specifically, the ISO 1999 model estimates age-related thresholds based on age and sex; it estimates noise-induced threshold shifts based on noise level and duration. It specifies that to estimate the final hearing thresholds for a person of given percentile, age, sex, and noise exposure, the expected age-related threshold is to be added to the expected noise-induced threshold shift. Examples show how these data can predict the relative contributions of aging and occupational noise to an STS.RESULTS: Early-career STSs, especially with high levels of noise exposure, are more likely to be primarily noise-induced. After the first decade of exposure, most STSs will be primarily age-related.CONCLUSION: Given a worker's age, sex, and occupational noise exposure history, ISO 1999 estimates of the expected contributions of aging and noise can supplement clinical judgment."
"26358094","Middle Latency Auditory Evoked Potential (MLAEP) in Workers with and without Tinnitus who are Exposed to Occupational Noise.","BACKGROUND: Tinnitus is an important occupational health concern, but few studies have focused on the central auditory pathways of workers with a history of occupational noise exposure. Thus, we analyzed the central auditory pathways of workers with a history of occupational noise exposure who had normal hearing threshold, and compared middle latency auditory evoked potential in those with and without noise-induced tinnitus.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty individuals (30 with and 30 without tinnitus) underwent the following procedures: anamnesis, immittance measures, pure-tone air conduction thresholds at all frequencies between 0.25-8 kHz, and middle latency auditory evoked potentials.RESULTS: Quantitative analysis of latencies and amplitudes of middle latency auditory evoked potential showed no significant differences between the groups with and without tinnitus. In the qualitative analysis, we found that both groups showed increased middle latency auditory evoked potential latencies. The study group had more alterations of the &quot;both&quot; type regarding the Na-Pa amplitude, while the control group had more &quot;electrode effect&quot; alterations, but these alterations were not significantly different when compared to controls.CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with normal hearing with or without tinnitus who are exposed to occupational noise have altered middle latency auditory evoked potential, suggesting impairment of the auditory pathways in cortical and subcortical regions. Although differences did not reach significance, individuals with tinnitus seemed to have more abnormalities in components of the middle latency auditory evoked potential when compared to individuals without tinnitus, suggesting alterations in the generation and transmission of neuroelectrical impulses along the auditory pathway."

Although central auditory processing tests are widely used in other countries, they have not been standardized for the Polish population. The aim of the study has been to evaluate the range of reference values for 3 temporal processing tests: the duration pattern test (DPT), the frequency pattern test (FPT) and the gaps in noise test (GIN).MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 76 normal hearing individuals (38 women, 38 men) at the age of 18 to 54 years old (mean ± standard deviation: 39.4±9.1). All study participants had no history of any chronic disease and underwent a standard ENT examination.RESULTS: The reference range for the DPT was established at 55.3% or more of correct answers, while for the FPT it stood at 56.7% or more of correct answers. The mean threshold for both cars in the GIN test was defined as 6 ms. In this study there were no significant associations between the DPT, FPT and GIN results and age or gender. Symmetry between the ears in the case of the DPT, FPT and GIN was found.CONCLUSIONS: Reference ranges obtained in this study for the DPT and FPT in the Polish population are lower than reference ranges previously published for other nations while the GIN test results correspond to those published in the related literature. Further investigations are needed to explain the discrepancies between normative values in Poland and other countries and adapt tests for occupational medicine purposes.Wiele osób pracujacych w narazeniu na substancje neurotoksyczne wymaga badan w kierunku osrodkowych zaburzen slyszenia.

"26168954","Simultaneous effects of noise exposure and smoking on OAEs.","Noise is one of the most pervasive hazardous factors in the workplace. Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is the most common disorder related to noise exposure. Smoking is probably associated with hearing loss. The simultaneous effect of noise and smoking on hearing is a recent concern. In this study, we assessed the simultaneous effect of noise and smoking on standard pure tone audiometry (PTA) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DP-OAEs). This was an historical cohort study on 224 workers exposed to noise who were divided into two groups: Smokers and nonsmokers. DP-OAE response amplitudes were assessed. Data were analyzed by SPSS software (version 19) using Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U test. One hundred and five subjects were smokers (case group) and 119 individuals were nonsmokers (control group). All the subjects were exposed to 91.08 + 2.29 dBA [time-weighted average (TWA) for an 8 h work shift]. Mean DP-OAE response amplitude at frequencies higher than 1,000 Hz was significantly higher in the smokers than the nonsmokers. This study showed that smoking can aggravate the effect of noise on hearing in DP-OAEs."

More and more evidences suggested that Catalase (CAT) gene polymorphism plays an important role in the development of NIHL. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of CAT gene polymorphisms with NIHL in a case-control study.DESIGN: A total of 719 unrelated adult Chinese Han population, including 225 healthy volunteers and 494 noise-exposed workers were recruited in this study. Six tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) were genotyped using an improved multiplex ligation detection reaction technique. Subsequently, the interaction between noise exposure level and genotypes and their effect on NIHL were analyzed using logistic regression.RESULTS: Among six tSNPs, two of them (rs208679 and rs769217) were significantly associated with noise exposure level. For rs208679 recessive effect, GG genotype had a significantly increased of NIHL risk in the exposure level of &lt;85 dB; and for rs769217 dominant effect, the combined genotypes TT/TC had a significantly increased of NIHL risk in the exposure level of 85 dB~92 dB; and the haplotype A-G-T-C-A-C had a risk effect on the NIHL in the exposure level of 85 dB~92 dB. In addition, the rs769217 polymorphism could enhance the transcription activities of the CAT gene.CONCLUSIONS: This study identified CAT is a NIHL susceptibility gene when noise exposure levels are taken into account. Rs208679 and rs769217 polymorphisms might be used as relevant risk estimates for the development of NIHL in population with different noise exposure levels."
"25992147","Hearing profile of brazilian forestry workers' noise exposure.","Introduction Researchers studying the hearing health of forestry workers have revealed the presence of a noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in this population and have concluded that the vibration of the equipment, the carbon monoxide released by motors, and pesticides might also contribute to NIHL. Objective To analyze the noise exposure in the Brazilian forestry industry workers and the effects on hearing. Methods The study sample comprised 109 employees of a company that specialized in reforestation. Their participants' mean age was 35.5 years (21 to 54 years), mean tenure at the company was 3.9 years (1 to 13 years), and mean total duration of noise exposure was 12.3 years (1 to 30 years). The existing documentation reporting on the jobs risk analysis was examined, noise level was measured, and pure tone audiometry was performed in all participants. Participants were divided into three groups according to their noise exposure levels in their current job. Results Of the participants who were exposed to noise levels less than 85 dBA (decibels with A-weighting filter), 23.8% had hearing loss, and 5.5% of the participants who were exposed to noise ranging from 85 to 89.9 dBA and 11% of the participants who were exposed to noise greater than 90 dBA had audiogram results suggestive of NIHL. Conclusion The implementation of a hearing loss prevention program tailored to forestry workers is needed. "

Participants included DCs who regularly used these handpieces (n = 16), DPs who did not use these handpieces (n = 13), and DSs (n = 8). A questionnaire was used to collect demographic information, assess occupational and recreational noise exposure, and note the level of hearing protection used. A sound level meter was used to measure the sound intensity generated by dental instruments near a clinician's ear. Results showed that DCs who regularly used high-speed handpieces had worse hearing than did members of the other study groups. These results indicate that the implementation of protective strategies should help to reduce the prevalence of occupational hearing loss among DCs. "
"25919036","Evaluation of noise-induced hearing loss by auditory steady-state and auditory brainstem-evoked responses.","OBJECTIVES: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) may result from occupational noise exposures and is considered as an 'Occupational Disease'; therefore, it is compensable. To verify the existence and severity of the work-related hearing loss, there is a need of an objective, reliable auditory measure in cases of arbitration of financial disputes to resolve any medicolegal aspects. The objective of the study was to compare between the ABR and ASSR for predicting the behavioural threshold in subjects with normal hearing or NIHL.DESIGN: The study included 82 subjects regularly exposed to high levels of occupational noise, with normal hearing and NIHL. ABR to clicks and to tone bursts were recorded followed by multiple-frequency ASSR. Physiological and behavioural thresholds were compared for specific frequencies (1000, 2000 Hz) and average of high-frequency range (2000 and 4000 Hz). In addition, Pearson correlations and the specificity and sensitivity of each measure were also calculated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.RESULTS: In the NIHL group, there was a significantly smaller difference between the behavioural threshold and click-ABR than the ASSR in high-frequency range. Pearson correlations were significantly higher for click-ABR. Analysis of specific frequencies yielded a smaller difference between behavioural and ASSR than tone-burst-ABR thresholds, with a slightly better correlation for ASSR than tone-burst-ABR. Higher sensitivity but lower specificity was suggested for ASSR than ABR.CONCLUSIONS: ASSR is associated with high-frequency specificity, shorter test sessions and good correlations with behavioural thresholds, making it a potentially better measure than ABR for predicting audiograms in subjects with NIHL. These findings have diagnostic implications, especially in cases of workers' compensation when subjects may be uncooperative."

The study sample consisted of 5,447 Koreans aged =60 years who received a hearing assessment. Hearing loss was measured using a pure tone audiometry test and classified according to the World Health Organization's criteria. Hearing aid use was assessed by self-report. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the associations between hearing loss, hearing aid use, and related variables.RESULTS: Hearing loss was found in 16.8% of the elders and only 15.9% of them used a hearing aid. Male (95% CI: 1.27-2.15), tinnitus (95% CI: 1.58-2.32), dizziness (95% CI: 1.05-1.73), and occupational noise exposure (95% CI: 1.32-2.38) were the variables most strongly associated with hearing loss after multivariate adjustment. Tinnitus (95% CI: 1.34-4.13) and occupational noise exposure (95% CI: 1.01-5.02) were strongly associated with hearing aid use after multivariate adjustment.CONCLUSION: More than half of South Korean elders aged =60 and older have hearing loss but the rate of hearing aid use is very low. An aural public health program should address modifiable risk factors, such as tinnitus and noise exposure, and non-modifiable risk factors associated with hearing loss in the elderly."

Presently, there are no epidemiological data on hearing loss in Germany based on this criterion.METHODS: A representative sample of adults from Oldenburg and Emden were invited for a hearing assessment. This article analyzes the association between hearing loss and age, sex, noise, occupation, and educational level. Age- and sex-specific prevalence rates following the WHO classification are compared with international findings.RESULTS: According to the WHO classification, the prevalence of hearing impairment in the study cohort (n=1,866) is approx. 16%. In men, who more commonly work in noisy jobs, a higher prevalence rate is observed than in women of the same age. Nevertheless, sex differences in the present study are smaller than those reported in most international studies. PTA-4 is approximately the same for men and women when effects of occupational noise are controlled, but differences in prevalence between occupational areas are still significant.CONCLUSION: Compared with international findings, age-specific prevalence rates in HÖRSTAT are low. In the synopsis of epidemiological studies of the past 25 years, a trend toward decreasing prevalence in middle and higher age groups can be observed."
"25665831","The role of genetic factors for hearing deterioration across 20 years: a twin study.","BACKGROUND: Hearing deterioration at advanced ages is associated with environmental exposures (eg, to noise and solvents) and genetic influences may also be important. Little is known about the role of genetic influences on hearing when evaluated longitudinally. We sought to investigate longitudinal hearing loss in a cohort of adult male twins to evaluate the importance of genetic and environmental factors for hearing deterioration over time.METHODS: Hearing using conventional clinical audiometry was assessed in 583 male twins (128 monozygotic twin pairs and 111 dizygotic twin pairs) aged 34-79 at baseline and again two decades later. The hearing thresholds at two time points were compared at each frequency and in two different frequency regions. Genetic analyses were based on structural equation models. Bivariate Cholesky decomposition was used for longitudinal analysis.RESULTS: The prevalence of hearing loss increased over time in better and worse ear. The hearing threshold shift was more pronounced in the high-frequency region, especially at 8000 Hz. Genetic influences were moderate (heritability: 53%-65%) for pure-tone averages at both lower and higher frequencies, and were of equal magnitude at baseline and follow-up. In contrast, environmental influences were of substantial importance (55%-88%) for rate of change of the hearing threshold over the 18-year period.CONCLUSIONS: Genetic factors are of considerable importance for level of hearing acuity, but environmental factors are more important for rate of change over an 18-year period."

For more than a decade, a number of laboratories have investigated the use of antioxidants as a safe and effective adjunct to hearing conservation programs. Of the antioxidants that have been investigated, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has consistently reduced permanent NIHL in the laboratory, but its clinical efficacy is still controversial. This study provides a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating the safety profile and the efficacy of NAC to prevent hearing loss in a military population after weapons training. Of the 566 total study subjects, 277 received NAC while 289 were given placebo. The null hypothesis for the rate of STS was not rejected based on the measured results. While no significant differences were found for the primary outcome, rate of threshold shifts, the right ear threshold shift rate difference did approach significance (p = 0.0562). No significant difference was found in the second primary outcome, percentage of subjects experiencing an adverse event between placebo and NAC groups (26.7% and 27.4%, respectively, p = 0.4465). Results for the secondary outcome, STS rate in the trigger hand ear, did show a significant difference (34.98% for placebo-treated, 27.14% for NAC-treated, p-value = 0.0288). Additionally, post-hoc analysis showed significant differences in threshold shift rates when handedness was taken into account. While the secondary outcomes and post-hoc analysis suggest that NAC treatment is superior to the placebo, the present study design failed to confirm this. The lack of significant differences in overall hearing loss between the treatment and placebo groups may be due to a number of factors, including suboptimal dosing, premature post-exposure audiograms, or differences in risk between ears or subjects. Based on secondary outcomes and post hoc analyses however, further studies seem warranted and are needed to clarify dose response and the factors that may have played a role in the observed results.

Noise levels (A-weighted decibels [dBA]) were measured over 12 weeks, three times a day, during the 2010 dry season using a sound level meter. A questionnaire was administered (515 respondents; 304 in Agbowo, 211 in Ajibode) and audiometric measurements were conducted on 40% of respondents. Mean noise levels varied by source (104 ± 7.7 dBA [diesel], 94.0 ± 6.3 dBA [petrol]) and were highest midday (90.6 ± 5.3 dBA [Agbowo], 70.9 ± 6.2 dBA [Ajibode]). Mean noise levels in Agbowo (78.5 ± 3.9 dBA) and Ajibode (65.7 ± 4.4 dBA) exceeded World Health Organization guidelines (65 dBA) for outdoor commercial environments. Working and living in Agbowo was significantly associated with current evidence of hearing impairment (odds ratio: 6.8, 95% confidence interval: 3.4-13.7). Reducing exposure to noise from electric power generators serving urban small businesses and homes is warranted."

"27957560","Auditory and Nonauditory Effects of Ultrasonic Scaler Use and Its Role in the Development of Permanent Hearing Loss.","PURPOSE: To evaluate the negative auditory and non-auditory effects developed immediately after using ultrasonic scalers and their potential role in the development of permanent hearing loss.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The auditory functions of 60 dental clinicians were evaluated with the pure tone audiometry test (PTA), tympanogram and the otoacoustic emission test (OAE) before and immediately after using ultrasonic scalers. The paired t-test was used to evaluate the difference in the pre- and post-exposure recordings for all three tests.RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the PTA and tympanogram test results, along with reduced OAE values immediately after using ultrasonic scalers. Hearing ability dropped by 63% to 66% immediately after using ultrasonic scalers. The maximum hearing disability was noted for low-frequency thresholds. The reduction was greater in the left than in the right ear.CONCLUSIONS: Noise-emitting devices such as ultrasonic scalers produce significant immediate auditory and non-auditory changes. It is important that dentists recognise the initial signs of hearing damage and adopt appropriate measures while working to prevent the development of permanent hearing impairment in future."
"27941700","The Adverse Effects of Heavy Metals with and without Noise Exposure on the Human Peripheral and Central Auditory System: A Literature Review.","Exposure to some chemicals in the workplace can lead to occupational chemical-induced hearing loss. Attention has mainly focused on the adverse auditory effects of solvents. However, other chemicals such as heavy metals have been also identified as ototoxic agents. The aim of this work was to review the current scientific knowledge about the adverse auditory effects of heavy metal exposure with and without co-exposure to noise in humans. PubMed and Medline were accessed to find suitable articles. A total of 49 articles met the inclusion criteria. Results from the review showed that no evidence about the ototoxic effects in humans of manganese is available. Contradictory results have been found for arsenic, lead and mercury as well as for the possible interaction between heavy metals and noise. All studies found in this review have found that exposure to cadmium and mixtures of heavy metals induce auditory dysfunction. Most of the studies investigating the adverse auditory effects of heavy metals in humans have investigated human populations exposed to lead. Some of these studies suggest peripheral and central auditory dysfunction induced by lead exposure. It is concluded that further evidence from human studies about the adverse auditory effects of heavy metal exposure is still required. Despite this issue, audiologists and other hearing health care professionals should be aware of the possible auditory effects of heavy metals."

Little is known about hearing loss and how it progresses in Veterans following military service. This epidemiology study is designed to evaluate and monitor a cohort of Veterans for 20 years or more to determine how hearing loss changes over time and how those changes are related to noise exposure and other ototoxic exposures encountered during military service. Data reported here are from baseline assessments of the first 100 study participants (84 males; 16 females; mean age 33.5 years; SD 8.8; range 21-58). Each participant was asked to complete a comprehensive audiologic examination and self-report questionnaires regarding sociodemographic characteristics, noise and solvent exposures, health conditions common among post-deployment Veterans, and the social and emotional consequences of hearing loss. For this relatively young cohort, 29% exhibited hearing loss, defined as average hearing threshold &gt;20 dB HL in the conventional audiometric range. Forty-two percent exhibited hearing loss in the extended-high-frequency audiometric range using the same criterion (average hearing threshold &gt;20 dB HL). Certain factors were found to be associated with poorer hearing in both conventional and extended-high-frequency ranges, including age, type of military branch, years of military service, number of military deployments, noise exposure, tinnitus, and a positive screen for post-traumatic stress disorder. Although the majority of participants had hearing within normal limits, 27% reported a self-perceived mild/moderate hearing handicap and 14% reported a significant handicap. Further research is needed to identify a cause for this discrepancy in audiologic results versus self-report. The information obtained from this longitudinal study could be used in future resource planning with the goal of preventing, as much as possible, the development of hearing loss during military service, and the exacerbation of prevalent hearing loss after military service and over Veterans' lifetimes."

The average working hours per week was categorized into 40 h and lower group, more than 40 to 48 h group, more than 48 to 60 h group, and more than 60 h group. The groups were defined as suffering from low or high frequencies hearing impairment if the average hearing threshold for 0.5, 1, 2 kHz or 3, 4, 6 kHz in both ears exceeds 25 dB based on the pure tone audiometry. The association between average weekly working hours and hearing impairment was analyzed using logistic regression after gender stratification.RESULTS: The prevalences of low and high frequencies hearing impairment in male workers were 4.3 and 28.6 %, respectively, which were much higher than female's prevalence of 2.7 and 11.1 %. For male workers, no significant association was found between average weekly working hours and low and high frequencies hearing impairment. For female workers, odds ratios (OR) of low and high frequencies hearing impairment were 4.22 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.09-16.27) and 4.49 (95 % CI 1.73-11.67), respectively, after controlling for several related factors, such as, age, Body Mass Index (BMI), socio-economic status, health-related behavioral, and occupational characteristics variables, in the final model in the group working more than 60 h compared to the group working 40 h and lower. In addition, a dose-response relationship was observed that ORs of low and high frequencies hearing impairment were increased according to increasing average weekly working hours.CONCLUSIONS: The association between long working hours and hearing impairment in both low and high frequencies was significant in Korean female workers with a dose-response relationship. Therefore, the law to change the culture of long working hours should be enacted in order to protect the workers' health and improve the quality of life in Korean workers."

"27540829","A faceoff with hazardous noise: Noise exposure and hearing threshold shifts of indoor hockey officials.","Noise exposure and hearing thresholds of indoor hockey officials of the Western States Hockey League were measured to assess the impact of hockey game noise on hearing sensitivity. Twenty-nine hockey officials who officiated the league in an arena in southeastern Wyoming in October, November, and December 2014 participated in the study. Personal noise dosimetry was conducted to determine if officials were exposed to an equivalent sound pressure level greater than 85 dBA. Hearing thresholds were measured before and after hockey games to determine if a 10 dB or greater temporary threshold shift in hearing occurred. Pure-tone audiometry was conducted in both ears at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz. All noise exposures were greater than 85 dBA, with a mean personal noise exposure level of 93 dBA (SD = 2.2), providing 17.7% (SD = 6.3) of the officials' daily noise dose according to the OSHA criteria. Hearing threshold shifts of 10 dB or greater were observed in 86.2% (25/29) of officials, with 36% (9/25) of those threshold shifts equaling 15 dB or greater. The largest proportion of hearing threshold shifts occurred at 4000 Hz, comprising 35.7% of right ear shifts and 31.8% of left ear shifts. The threshold shifts between the pre- and post-game audiometry were statistically significant in the left ear at 500 (p=.019), 2000 (p=.0009), 3000 (p&lt;.0001) and 4000 Hz (p=.0002), and in the right ear at 2000 (p=.0001), 3000 (p=.0001) and 4000 Hz (p&lt;.0001), based on Wilcoxon-ranked sum analysis. Although not statistically significant at alpha = 0.05, logistic regression indicated that with each increase of one dB of equivalent sound pressure measured from personal noise dosimetry, the odds of a = 10 dB TTS were increased in the left ear at 500 (OR=1.33, 95% CI 0.73-2.45), 3000 (OR=1.02, 95% CI 0.68-1.51), 4000 (OR=1.26, 95% CI 0.93-1.71) and 8000 Hz (OR=1.22, 95% CI 0.76-1.94) and in the right ear at 6000 (OR=1.03, 95% CI 0.14-7.84) and 8000 Hz (OR=1.29, 95% CI 0.12-13.83). These findings suggest that indoor hockey officials are exposed to hazardous levels of noise, experience temporary hearing loss after officiating games, and a hearing conservation program is warranted. Further temporary threshold shift research has the potential to identify officials of other sporting events that are at an increased risk of noise-induced hearing loss."

The actual workers' hearing threshold levels (HTLs) were compared with the predictions calculated according to PN-ISO 1999:2000 based on age, gender and noise exposure.RESULTS: Workers under study were exposed to noise at daily noise exposure levels of 82.7-94.8 dB (mean: 90.9 dB) for a period of 3-14 years. In all subjects, mean HTL at 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz did not exceed 25 dB. Nevertheless, high frequency notches were found in 11% of audiograms. The actual workers' HTLs at 3000-6000 Hz were similar to those predicted using PN-ISO 1999:2000. There were statistical significant differences between HTLs in subgroups of people with higher (&gt; 78 mm Hg) and lower (= 78 mm Hg) diastolic blood pressure, smokers and non-smokers, and those working with organic solvents. Hearing loss was more evident in subjects affected by the additional risk factors specified above.CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the need to consider, in addition to noise, also some other NIHL risk factors, such as tobacco smoking, elevated blood pressure, and co-exposure to organic solvents when estimating the risk of NIHL and developing the hearing conservation programs for workers.

"27340983","Hearing Loss in Persons Exposed and not Exposed to Occupational Noise.","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare hearing loss in individuals at risk and those not at risk for occupational noise and to compare working loss by gender.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis used data from a current Czech Ministry of Health grant project called Epidemiological and Genetic Study of the Frequency of Hearing Loss (2011 to 2015; NT12246-5/2011). The analyzed sample comprised 4988 participants. Hearing was tested using pure-tone threshold audiometry, tympanometry, and measurement of the stapedius reflex.RESULTS: Females at risk and those not at risk for occupational noise who were younger than 44 years and older than 75 years were found to have no statistically significant differences at any pure-tone threshold audiometry frequency. In females aged 45 to 74 years, statistically significant differences were found. In males, hearing loss was observed as early as 18 years of age. When comparing males and females at no risk for occupational noise, there were no statistically significant differences at any of the frequencies in those younger than 29 years. In females aged 30 years or older, statistically significant differences were observed at various frequencies in all age groups. When comparing males and females at risk for occupational noise, statistically significant differences were more frequent than in employees not exposed to noise.CONCLUSION: Hearing loss in females does not significantly vary depending on occupational exposure. The opposite is true for males. However, the maximum differences in mean levels did not exceed 10 dB. It is therefore clear that noise is a preventable factor, and the use of personal protective equipment is warranted."

Hearing thresholds were measured by pure tone audiometry in two consecutive examinations (n = 226). STS was defined as an average change in hearing thresholds = + 10 dB at 2,000 Hz, 3,000 Hz, and 4,000 Hz in either ear. Determinants of STS were assessed through a questionnaire. The incidence of STS was 23.0%. Significant determinants of STS were the number of episodes of temporary threshold shifts (TTS) in the Navy, exposure to continuous loud noise during work on board, and the number of gun shots (in the Navy, hunting, and sports). This study indicated a significant association between noise exposure on board Navy vessels and development of STS. "

This study was undertaken with a view to investigate the relationship between blood lead level (BLL) and hearing loss in workers in a lead-acid battery manufacturing plant in Tehran, Iran.METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 609 male workers were recruited from different locations in the factory. Association between BLL and hearing loss in different frequencies were measured. Relationships were analyzed by logistic regressions. Statistical significance was defined as p-value &lt;0.05.RESULTS: Six hundred nine male workers with mean age 40<U+2009>±<U+2009>7<U+2009>years and mean noise exposure level of 80 (75-85) dB were evaluated. BLLs were categorized into four quartiles, and hearing loss in each quartile was compared to the first one. In our regression models, BLL was associated significantly with high frequency hearing loss, adjusted odds ratios for the comparison of the fourth, third, and second quartiles to the first one are respectively: 3.98 (95% CI: 1.63-9.71, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.00), 3.05 (95% CI: 1.28-7.26, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01), and 2.89 (95% CI: 1.11-7.51, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.03).CONCLUSION: This study showed a dose-response relationship between BLL and hearing loss, after adjusting for potential confounders (age, body mass index, work duration, smoking, and occupational noise exposure) in logistic regressions. It is concluded that periodic hearing assessment by pure tone audiometry in workers exposed to lead should be recommended. However, additional studies are required to clarify the mechanisms of lead ototoxicity."
"26892792","Hearing loss in workers exposed to epoxy adhesives and noise: a cross-sectional study.","OBJECTIVES: Epoxy adhesives contain organic solvents and are widely used in industry. The hazardous effects of epoxy adhesives remain unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the risk of hearing loss among workers exposed to epoxy adhesives and noise.DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.METHODS: For this cross-sectional study, we recruited 182 stone workers who were exposed to both epoxy adhesives and noise, 89 stone workers who were exposed to noise only, and 43 workers from the administrative staff who had not been exposed to adhesives or noise. We obtained demographic data, occupational history and medical history through face-to-face interviews and arranged physical examinations and pure-tone audiometric tests. We also conducted walk-through surveys in the stone industry. A total of 40 representative noise assessments were conducted in 15 workplaces. Air sampling was conducted at 40 workplaces, and volatile organic compounds were analysed using the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) TO-15 method.RESULTS: The mean sound pressure level was 87.7 dBA (SD 9.9). The prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss was considerably increased in the stone workers exposed to epoxy adhesives (42%) compared with the stone workers who were not exposed to epoxy adhesives (21%) and the administrative staff group (9.3%). A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that exposure to epoxy adhesives significantly increased the risk of hearing loss between 2 and 6 kHz after adjusting for age. Significant interactions between epoxy adhesives and noise and hearing impairment were observed at 3, 4 and 6 kHz.CONCLUSIONS: Epoxy adhesives exacerbate hearing impairment in noisy environments, with the main impacts occurring in the middle and high frequencies."

"29220389","Association of genetic variations in FOXO3 gene with susceptibility to noise induced hearing loss in a Chinese population.","Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL), a multifactorial disease involving both genetic and environmental factors, is one of the most important occupational health hazards. Nonetheless, the influence of FOXO3 variants on NIHL risk have not been illuminated. This research was conducted to explore the effects of FOXO3 polymorphisms on individual susceptibility to NIHL. A total of 2689 industrial workers from one textile factory of east China were recruited to participate in the current research. Venous blood was collected, questionnaire and pure-tone audiometry (PTA) was conducted by specialist physicians. Then, we performed genotyping of three selected SNPs (rs2802292, rs10457180, and rs12206094) in FOXO3 gene in 566 NIHL patients and 566 controls. Subsequently, the main effects of genotype and its interactions were evaluated. Our results revealed that individuals with the G allele of rs2802292, G allele of rs10457180, T allele of rs12206094 (OR = 1.43, 1.43, and 1.31 respectively) and the haplotype GAC and others (TGT/GGT/GGC/GAT) (rs2802292-rs10457180-rs12206094) (OR = 1.49 and 2.09 respectively) are associated with an increased risk of NIHL in a Chinese population. Stratified analysis showed that an increased NIHL risk was found in the subjects who exposed to noise &gt;16 years with rs2802292 GG/GT and rs10457180 AG/GG genotype with an OR of 1.62 and 1.66 respectively. Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis indicated that rs10457180, rs2802292, and rs12206094 have interactions and are related to increased NIHL risk (OR = 1.53). The genetic polymorphism rs2802292, rs10457180, and rs12206094 within FOXO3 gene are associated with an increased risk of NIHL in a Chinese population and have potential to be biomarkers for noise exposed workers."
"29208018","Noise exposure during prehospital emergency physicians work on Mobile Emergency Care Units and Helicopter Emergency Medical Services.","BACKGROUND: Prehospital personnel are at risk of occupational hearing loss due to high noise exposure. The aim of the study was to establish an overview of noise exposure during emergency responses in Mobile Emergency Care Units (MECU), ambulances and Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS). A second objective was to identify any occupational hearing loss amongst prehospital personnel.METHODS: Noise exposure during work in the MECU and HEMS was measured using miniature microphones worn laterally to the auditory canals or within the earmuffs of the helmet. All recorded sounds were analysed in proportion to a known tone of 94 dB. Before and after episodes of noise exposure, the physicians underwent a hearing test indicating whether the noise had had any impact on the function of the outer sensory hair cells. This was accomplished by measuring the amplitude level shifts of the Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions. Furthermore, the prehospital personnels' hearing was investigated using pure-tone audiometry to reveal any occupational hearing loss. All prehospital personnel were compared to ten in-hospital controls.RESULTS: Our results indicate high-noise exposure levels of =80 dB(A) during use of sirens on the MECU and during HEMS operations compared to in-hospital controls (70 dB(A)). We measured an exposure up to =90 dB(A) under the helmet for HEMS crew. No occupational hearing loss was identified with audiometry. A significant level shift of the Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions at 4 kHz for HEMS crew compared to MECU physicians was found indicating that noise affected the outer hair cell function of the inner ear, thus potentially reducing the hearing ability of the HEMS crew.DISCUSSION: Further initiatives to prevent noise exposure should be taken, such as active noise reduction or custom-made in-ear protection with communication system for HEMS personnel. Furthermore, better insulation of MECU and ambulances is warranted.CONCLUSION: We found that the exposure levels exceeded the recommendations described in the European Regulative for Noise, which requires further protective initiatives. Although no hearing loss was demonstrated in the personnel of the ground-based units, a reduced function of the outer sensory hair cells was found in the HEMS group following missions."

Furthermore, the risk of hearing loss among the baseline and the follow-up populations according to first year of occupational noise exposure is evaluated.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2001-2003, we conducted a baseline survey of noise- and hearing-related disorders in 11 industries with suspected high noise levels. In 2009-2010, we were able to follow up on 271 out of the 554 baseline workers (49%). Mean noise levels per industry and self-reported HPD use are described at baseline and follow-up. The association between cumulative occupational noise exposure and hearing threshold shift over the 10-year period was assessed using linear regression, and the risk of hearing loss according to year of first occupational noise exposure was evaluated with logistic regression.RESULTS: Over the 10-year period, mean noise levels declined from 83.9 dB(A) to 82.8 dB(A), and for workers exposed &gt;85 dB(A), the use of HPD increased from 70.1 to 76.1%. We found a weak, statistically insignificant, inverse association between higher ambient cumulative noise exposure and poorer hearing (-0.10<U+2009>dB hearing threshold shift per dB-year (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.36; 0.16)). The risk of hearing loss seemed to increase with earlier first year of noise exposure, but odds ratios were only statistically significant among baseline participants with first exposure before the 1980s (odds ratio: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.11; 3.22).CONCLUSIONS: We observed declining industrial noise levels, increased use of HPD and no significant impact on hearing thresholds from current ambient industrial noise levels, which indicated a successful implementation of Danish hearing conservation programs."

"28716314","Safety and efficacy of ebselen for the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial.","BACKGROUND: Noise-induced hearing loss is a leading cause of occupational and recreational injury and disease, and a major determinant of age-related hearing loss. No therapeutic agent has been approved for the prevention or treatment of this disorder. In animal models, glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) activity is reduced after acute noise exposure. Ebselen, a novel GPx1 mimic, has been shown to reduce both temporary and permanent noise-induced hearing loss in preclinical studies. We assessed the safety and efficacy of ebselen for the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss in young adults in a phase 2 clinical trial.METHODS: In this single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial, healthy adults aged 18-31 years were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) at the University of Florida (Gainsville, FL, USA) to receive ebselen 200 mg, 400 mg, or 600 mg, or placebo orally twice daily for 4 days, beginning 2 days before a calibrated sound challenge (4 h of pre-recorded music delivered by insert earphones). Randomisation was done with an allocation sequence generated by an independent third party. The primary outcome was mean temporary threshold shift (TTS) at 4 kHz measured 15 min after the calibrated sound challenge by pure tone audiometry; a reduction of 50% in an ebselen dose group compared with the placebo group was judged to be clinically relevant. All participants who received the calibrated sound challenge and at least one dose of study drug were included in the efficacy analysis. All randomly assigned patients were included in the safety analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01444846.FINDINGS: Between Jan 11, 2013, and March 24, 2014, 83 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive ebselen 200 mg (n=22), 400 mg (n=20), or 600 mg (n=21), or placebo (n=20). Two participants in the 200 mg ebselen group were discontinued from the study before the calibrated sound challenge because they no longer met the inclusion criteria; these participants were excluded from the efficacy analysis. Mean TTS at 4 kHz was 1·32 dB (SE 0·91) in the 400 mg ebselen group compared with 4·07 dB (0·90) in the placebo group, representing a significant reduction of 68% (difference -2·75 dB, 95% CI -4·54 to -0·97; p=0·0025). Compared with placebo, TTS at 4 kHz was non-significantly reduced by 21% in the 200 mg ebselen group (3·23 dB [SE 0·91] vs 4·07 dB [0·90] in the placebo group; difference -0·84 dB, 95% CI -2·63 to 0·94; p=0·3542) and by 7% in the 600 mg ebselen group (3·81 dB [0·90] vs 4·07 dB [0·90] in the placebo group; difference -0·27, 95% CI -2·03 to 1·50; p=0·7659). Ebselen treatment was well tolerated across all doses and no significant differences were seen in any haematological, serum chemistry, or radiological assessments between the ebselen groups and the placebo group.INTERPRETATION: Treatment with ebselen was safe and effective at a dose of 400 mg twice daily in preventing a noise-induced TTS. These data lend support to a role of GPx1 activity in acute noise-induced hearing loss.FUNDING: Sound Pharmaceuticals."

In this study, we evaluated the OEC in an occupational setting in order to assess test sensitivity, specificity, and validity. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2015, in which the optimized OEC was evaluated on 94 employees from the army and three different companies in construction and manufacturing. Subjects underwent OEC in an office-like room. Pure-tone air conduction audiometry was performed as a reference test. The OEC was repeated for a subset of subjects (N=19). Important test characteristics (ie, sensitivity and specificity, test validity, and test-retest reliability) were assessed. Results When analyzed on the individual level, the sensitivity and specificity of OEC were 90% and 77%, respectively. The speech reception threshold results correlated strongly with the pure-tone average of the frequencies 3, 4 and 6 kHz, reflecting good test validity (r=0.79). The difference between test and retest was not significant. The intra-class correlation coefficient was moderate (r=0.57), indicating a reasonable agreement between test and retest. Conclusions The OEC appears to be a suitable test for the detection of high-frequency hearing loss among noise-exposed employees, with good sensitivity and specificity values, even when performed in a semi-controlled occupational setting, though a possible learning effect should be taken into account."

Some studies have suggested that diabetes may cause sensorineural hearing loss, whereas others have failed to find an association. The biggest challenge in investigating the association between diabetes and hearing loss is the presence of confounding variables and the complexity of the auditory system. Our study investigated the association between diabetes and sensorineural hearing loss. We evaluated the influence of time from diabetes diagnosis on this association after controlling for age, gender, and hypertension diagnosis and excluding those subjects with exposure to noise.METHODS: This cross-sectional study evaluated 901 adult and elderly Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) participants from São Paulo, Brazil who underwent audiometry testing as part of ELSA-Brasil's baseline assessment.RESULTS: Hearing thresholds and speech test results were significantly worse in the group with diabetes than in the group without diabetes. However, no significant differences were found between participants with and without diabetes after adjusting for age, gender, and the presence of hypertension. Hearing thresholds were not affected by occupational noise exposure in the groups with and without diabetes. In addition, no association between the duration of diabetes and hearing thresholds was observed after adjusting for age, gender, and hypertension.CONCLUSION: We found no association between the duration of diabetes and worse hearing thresholds after models were adjusted for age, gender, and the presence of hypertension."
"28220907","Exposure to excessive sounds and hearing status in academic classical music students.","OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess hearing of music students in relation to their exposure to excessive sounds.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Standard pure-tone audiometry (PTA) was performed in 168 music students, aged 22.5±2.5 years. The control group included 67 subjects, non-music students and non-musicians, aged 22.8±3.3 years. Data on the study subjects' musical experience, instruments in use, time of weekly practice and additional risk factors for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) were identified by means of a questionnaire survey. Sound pressure levels produced by various groups of instruments during solo and group playing were also measured and analyzed. The music students' audiometric hearing threshold levels (HTLs) were compared with the theoretical predictions calculated according to the International Organization for Standardization standard ISO 1999:2013.RESULTS: It was estimated that the music students were exposed for 27.1±14.3 h/week to sounds at the A-weighted equivalent-continuous sound pressure level of 89.9±6.0 dB. There were no significant differences in HTLs between the music students and the control group in the frequency range of 4000-8000 Hz. Furthermore, in each group HTLs in the frequency range 1000-8000 Hz did not exceed 20 dB HL in 83% of the examined ears. Nevertheless, high frequency notched audiograms typical of the noise-induced hearing loss were found in 13.4% and 9% of the musicians and non-musicians, respectively. The odds ratio (OR) of notching in the music students increased significantly along with higher sound pressure levels (OR = 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.014-1.13, p &lt; 0.05). The students' HTLs were worse (higher) than those of a highly screened non-noise-exposed population. Moreover, their hearing loss was less severe than that expected from sound exposure for frequencies of 3000 Hz and 4000 Hz, and it was more severe in the case of frequency of 6000 Hz.CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the need for further studies and development of a hearing conservation program for music students.

"29889779","Occupational Noise Exposure and Risk for Noise-Induced Hearing Loss Due to Temporal Bone Drilling.","BACKGROUND: Noise-induced hearing loss is one of the most common occupational hazards in the United States. Several studies have described noise-induced hearing loss in patients following mastoidectomy. Although otolaryngologists care for patients with noise-induced hearing loss, few studies in the English literature have examined surgeons' occupational risk.METHODS: Noise dosimeters and sound level meters with octave band analyzers were used to assess noise exposure during drilling of temporal bones intraoperatively and in a lab setting. Frequency specific sound intensities were recorded. Sound produced using burrs of varying size and type were compared. Differences while drilling varying anatomic structures were assessed using drills from two manufacturers. Pure tone audiometry was performed on 7 to 10 otolaryngology residents before and after a temporal bone practicum to assess for threshold shifts.RESULTS: Noise exposure during otologic drilling can exceed over 100<U+200A>dB for short periods of time, and is especially loud using large diameter burrs &gt; 4<U+200A>mm, with cutting as compared with diamond burrs, and while drilling denser bone such as the cortex. Intensity peaks were found at 2.5, 5, and 6.3<U+200A>kHz. Drilling on the tegmen and sigmoid sinus revealed peaks at 10 and 12.5<U+200A>kHz. No temporary threshold shifts were found at 3 to 6<U+200A>kHz, but were found at 8 to 16<U+200A>kHz, though this did not reach statistical significance.CONCLUSION: This article examines noise exposure and threshold shifts during temporal bone drilling. We were unable to find previous descriptions in the literature of measurements done while multiple people drilling simultaneously, during tranlabyrinthine surgery and a specific frequency characterization of the change in peach that appears while drilling on the tegmen. Hearing protection should be considered, which would still allow the surgeon to appreciate pitch changes associated with drilling on sensitive structures and communication with surgical team members. As professionals who specialize in promoting the restoration and preservation of hearing for others, otologic surgeons should not neglect hearing protection for themselves."

Twenty factory workers exposed to noise and solvents along with 20 workers of similar age exposed only to noise in eastern China were investigated using pure-tone audiometry (1000-8000<U+2009>Hz). Exposure histories and shift-long noise recording files were obtained for each participant. The data were used in the calculation of the cumulative noise exposure (CNE) and CNE adjusted by the kurtosis metric for each participant. Passive samplers were used to measure solvent concentrations for each worker exposed to solvents over the full work shift. Results showed an interaction between noise exposure and solvents for the hearing threshold at 6000<U+2009>Hz. This effect was observed only when the CNE level was adjusted by the kurtosis metric."
"29457603","The hearing of rural workers exposed to noise and pesticides.","n work environments, different physical and chemical agents that may pose a risk to workers' hearing health coexist. In this context, occupational hearing loss stands out. It has mostly been attributed to only noise exposure, although there are other agents, that is, pesticides that might contribute to occupational hearing loss. In this report, two cases will be presented that consider rural workers exposed to pesticides and intense noise generated by an adapted rudimentary vehicle. The noise measured in this vehicle was 88.3 dBA up to 93.4 dBA. Pure-tone audiometry, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, and high-frequency audiometry tests were performed. This report is unusual because of the short time of exposure to noise and pesticides and the hearing loss found, indicating a synergy between those agents."
