"11103349","[Bilateral acoustic trauma after air bag inflation].","Airbag inflation is associated with a loud noise. This very short noise has a peak amplitude of 170 dB sound pressure level and can make otologic injuries. We report a case of acoustic trauma after airbag inflation. The 24-year-old man has hearing loss both side in the 3000- to 6000-Hz range and in the deep-frequency. The possibility of acoustic trauma from airbag noise are probably much more common and need more attention in the clinic."

"10923909","The role of magnesium in the susceptibility of soldiers to noise-induced hearing loss.","A number of studies have demonstrated that magnesium, administered prophylactically, can reduce the amount of hearing loss resulting from noise exposure. This study explored the possible role of naturally occurring body magnesium concentration in susceptibility of soldiers to noise-induced hearing loss. Participants were 68 adult males who had received extensive noise exposure over several years as a result of training with weapon systems. Each participant provided a pure-tone audiogram, blood sample, and noise-exposure history. A variety of pure-tone indices was correlated with serum magnesium levels as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. No significant correlations were observed between any audiometric index and body magnesium. The results of this study, therefore, do not support the hypothesis that there is a strong association between naturally occurring body magnesium and susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss."
"10894416","Influence of age and presbyacusis on DPOAE.","The influence of presbyacusis on distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) was studied on 180 ears of 96 normal-hearing subjects. The subjects' ages were distributed equally and ranged from 14 to 82 years. It was shown that there is a highly significant decrease in DPOAE amplitudes during the ageing process. By means of special statistical procedures, such as partial correlation and multiple regression, it was proved that the main reason for this is deterioration in pure-tone thresholds. However, other age-related effects were determined and were also found to lead to a further decrease in DPOAE amplitudes. The latter might be due to middle ear alterations in elderly people. Knowledge of the influence of presbyacusis on DPOAE is important if DPOAEs are to be used in expert assessment of inner ear disorders, for example, occupational noise-induced hearing loss."
"10857071","[Assessment of hearing impairment in workers exposed to mixtures of organic solvents in the paint and lacquer industry].","Clinical and experimental studies indicate a possible harmful effect of chemicals, especially organic solvents, on the hearing system. In combined exposure to noise and solvents, very common in industry, it is most likely that a synergetic action of these factors enhances the traumatising effect of exposure to noise. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence and the risk of hearing impairment in 117 paint and lacquer factory workers exposed to a mixture of organic solvents. An analysis of organic solvent mixtures reveals that xylene and ethyl acetate are their major components whose concentrations depend on individual workposts. The control group consisted of 76 workers exposed to noise exceeding, Threshold Limit Value and 125 healthy subjects exposed neither to noise nor to solvents in their occupational setting. Pure tone audiometry revealed the highest hearing thresholds in workers exposed to solvents, lower thresholds in those exposed to noise, and the lowest ones in the non-exposed individuals. Hearing loss was found in 30% of workers exposed to organic solvents, in 20% of noise-exposed subjects, and in only 6% of non-exposed subjects. The comparison of relative risk values also indicated significantly enhanced probability of hearing impairment in workers of the paint and lacquer factory (9.6; 3.2-25.6), which is even more strongly pronounced than in the group of subjects exposed to noise (4.2; 1.2-13.2). An analysis of hearing impairment risk in particular frequencies suggests that organic solvents may damage the inner ear in much greater extent than noise. The results of the study show that exposure to organic solvents may create a significant risk of hearing impairment. Therefore, further steps should be taken to include the exposed population into effective preventive programmes."
"10776364","Recreational firearm use and hearing loss.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the relation between recreational firearm use and high-frequency hearing loss in a population of older adults.DESIGN: Cross-sectional, population-based cohort study.SETTING: The midwestern community of Beaver Dam, Wis.PARTICIPANTS: A population-based sample of 3753 participants (83% of those eligible), aged 48 to 92 years, participated in the baseline phase of the Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study.INTERVENTION: None.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime and past year self-reported firearm use during target shooting and hunting were assessed by interview. Hearing thresholds were measured by pure-tone audiometry.RESULTS: After age and other factors were adjusted for, men (n = 1538) who had ever regularly engaged in target shooting (odds ratio, 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.19) or who had done so in the past year (odds ratio, 2.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-3.46) were more likely to have a marked high-frequency hearing loss than those who had not. Risk of having a marked high-frequency hearing loss increased 7% for every 5 years the men had hunted (odds ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.12). Thirty-eight percent of the target shooters and 95% of the hunters reported never wearing hearing protection while shooting in the past year.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that use of recreational firearms is associated with marked high-frequency hearing loss in men. There is a need for further education of users of recreational firearms regarding the risk of hearing impairment associated with firearm use and the availability and importance of appropriate hearing protection."

"10615655","[Acute hearing loss and tinnitus caused by amplified recreational music].","BACKGROUND: Hearing loss resulting from exposure to permanent or repeated amplified music in professional musicians and music consumers is described in literature. The risk of hearing loss does not exist only after prolonged exposure to music. Short-term exposure to very high sound levels, for example in concerts, can also cause hearing loss and tinnitus.PATIENTS: The retrospective study includes 24 patients who required rheologic therapy between 1994 and 1997 due to a music related acoustic trauma. The type, intensity, and length of music exposure as well as the distance and the position to the source of noise were examined. The type of hearing damage and its development during rheological treatment was studied by pure-tone audiometry.RESULTS: In the majority of examined patients (67%) the hearing loss developed on the basis of one-time exposure at a rock concert or pop concert, followed by hearing loss from attending discotheques (17%) or parties (12%), and music exposure from personal cassette players (4%). The majority of patients showed a maximum hearing loss of 40-60 dB (A) in a frequency between 3 kHz and 4 kHz. Pure-tone audiometry in 58% of the patients exhibited a unilateral threshold in a frequency between 3 kHz and 4 kHz combined with ipsilateral tinnitus of the same frequency. Twenty-one percent of the patients showed a symmetric bilateral threshold and tinnitus between 3 kHz and 4 kHz. In 8% there was a unilateral tinnitus, and in 13% a bilateral tinnitus without any hearing loss. All patients improved their hearing loss during rheologic treatment. Improvement in the tinnitus was only achieved in 33% of the examined cases.CONCLUSION: The risk of permanent hearing loss resulting from short-term exposure to amplified music is low compared to the risk of continuous tinnitus. Given the lack of acceptance of personal ear protectors, the risk of acute hearing damage due to amplified music could be reduced by avoiding the immediate proximity to the speakers."
"11692623","[An epidemiological study regarding the hearing acuity of residents in the area with high level of aircraft noise: results of hearing tests conducted in the vicinity of Kadena Air Base].","Hearing tests, primary and secondary, were conducted in two communities vicinal to Kadena US Air Base in Okinawa from May 1996 to July 1998. The noise exposure expressed in WECPNL as designated by the Defense Facilities Administration Agency ranged from 85 to 95 and above. A total of 2035 subjects aged between 25 and 69 years inclusive were considered eligible for inclusion in this study and among them 137 males and 206 females underwent the primary test. Before the test, subjects were asked about hearing difficulty, tinnitus, otological anamnesis and past experience of noise exposure at work and/or hobbies. The primary test was a pure tone audiometry using the ascending method of limits with 5 dB step at 7 test frequencies of 0.5 to 8 kHz. Forty individuals who were judged to have possible noise induced hearing loss were sent to Okinawa Chubu Hospital as subjects for the secondary test. The secondary test consisted of pure tone audiometry with 1 dB step at 9 test frequencies with the addition of 3 kHz and 6 kHz to the primary test frequencies, a Short Increment Sensitivity Index (SISI), test, tympanometry and audioscan audiometry. Based on test findings 12 subjects were considered to have noise induced hearing loss. The examiners interviewed the 12 subjects again to confirm that they had not experienced habitual or repeated intense noise exposure other than aircraft noise exposure around their homes. The geographical distribution of the subject's residences showed their proximity to the airfield, which strongly suggests that the cause of hearing loss may be exposure to aircraft noise from Kadena Air Base."
"11678172","Long-term objective and subjective audiologic consequences of closed head injury.","During a period of 5 years, a total of 47 patients, 16-60 years of age, with major closed head injury (CHI) were admitted to 2 Swedish medical centres. Seven to 11 years after injury, 25 of them (mean age 40.8 years; range 25-59 years) were evaluated using peripheral and central auditory tests, and most of them also completed 2 questionnaires concerning self-assessed hearing ability and quality of life. Twenty-two patients did not participate in the long-term follow-up tests: 15 were excluded for medical reasons and 4 did not wish to participate; an additional 2 were impossible to trace and 1 had died. As many as 68% of patients (17/25) demonstrated abnormalities on 1 or more of the audiometric tests, 14 on pure-tone audiometry (p &lt; 0.02) and/or central audiometric tests (3 on central tests only and 2 on pure-tone audiometry only). Four out of six patients with available early post-traumatic audiograms showed a significant progressive deterioration. As a group, their assessments of hearing ability and quality of life were equal to or better than those of the controls. These results may indicate that a higher priority should be given to obtaining an early audiologic evaluation of every CHI patient than is the rule today. The impact of post-traumatic progress and central lesions on social hearing at an advanced age is highlighted."
"11351289","The effects of noise on the vestibular system.","PURPOSE: Subjects with noise-induced hearing loss sometimes also complain about balance disorders, but reports of clinical series that give contradictory results are highly controversial. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of intense noise on the vestibular labyrinth, both in subjects with symmetrical hearing loss and in subjects with asymmetrical loss, and to examine the correlation between the subjects' complaints and the results of the vestibular function tests.METHODS: A total of 258 male military personnel, heavily exposed to various intense noises, were included in the study. They were divided into 2 groups according to their hearing; 134 had a symmetrical high-tone hearing loss, and 124 had asymmetrical losses. Each group was divided into 2 subgroups according to the presence or absence of vestibular complaints. All of the subjects underwent a complete audiological and electronystagmographic evaluation.RESULTS: We found that vestibular damage caused by intense noise exposure might be expressed clinically in subjects with asymmetrical hearing loss. There was a strong correlation between the subjects' complaints and the results of the vestibular function tests. There was no correlation between the severity of the hearing loss and the vestibular symptomatology and pathology.CONCLUSIONS: Subjects exposed to intense noise may have evidence of vestibular pathology only when there is an asymmetrical hearing loss. Whenever hearing loss is symmetrical, an equal damage to the vestibular system of both ears is most probably responsible for the absence of abnormal findings on the vestibular function tests. The results of this study have important medicolegal implications for individuals exposed to intense noises."
"11330914","Hearing assessment of classical orchestral musicians.","Pure-tone audiometry was performed on 140 classical orchestral musicians employed at the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra and the Gothenburg Opera in Sweden. This report is based on the results from hearing threshold measurements, presented as median audiograms according to gender, age group and instrument group. The results did not show severe hearing losses that could be attributed to exposure to musical noise. However, the study reflects the subjects' present hearing ability status and does not give an answer to the question of future hearing dysfunction. Female musicians were shown to have significantly better hearing thresholds in the high-frequency area than did male musicians. Furthermore, the median pure-tone hearing thresholds for the male musicians displayed a notch configuration at 6 kHz in the left ear, similar that of to noise-induced hearing loss. A small, but in general not significant, difference was detected when comparing the median hearing thresholds between each instrument group. Percussion and woodwind players displayed slightly worse hearing thresholds than did other musicians. Players of large string instruments had the best hearing threshold values. When comparing age groups and gender it was noted that the median hearing thresholds were stable and within 20 dB HL up to the age group of 40-49 years for both females and males."
"11324845","High-frequency (8 to 16 kHz) reference thresholds and intrasubject threshold variability relative to ototoxicity criteria using a Sennheiser HDA 200 earphone.","OBJECTIVE: The first purpose of this study was to determine high-frequency (8 to 16 kHz) thresholds for standardizing reference equivalent threshold sound pressure levels (RETSPLs) for a Sennheiser HDA 200 earphone. The second and perhaps more important purpose of this study was to determine whether repeated high-frequency thresholds using a Sennheiser HDA 200 earphone had a lower intrasubject threshold variability than the ASHA 1994 significant threshold shift criteria for ototoxicity.DESIGN: High-frequency thresholds (8 to 16 kHz) were obtained for 100 (50 male, 50 female) normally hearing (0.25 to 8 kHz) young adults (mean age of 21.2 yr) in four separate test sessions using a Sennheiser HDA 200 earphone.RESULTS: The mean and median high-frequency thresholds were similar for each test session and increased as frequency increased. At each frequency, the high-frequency thresholds were not significantly (p &gt; 0.05) different for gender, test ear, or test session. The median thresholds at each frequency were similar to the 1998 interim ISO RETSPLs; however, large standard deviations and wide threshold distributions indicated very high intersubject threshold variability, especially at 14 and 16 kHz. Threshold repeatability was determined by finding the threshold differences between each possible test session comparison (N = 6). About 98% of all of the threshold differences were within a clinically acceptable range of +/-10 dB from 8 to 14 kHz. The threshold differences between each subject's second, third, and fourth minus their first test session were also found to determine whether intrasubject threshold variability was less than the ASHA 1994 criteria for determining a significant threshold shift due to ototoxicity. The results indicated a false-positive rate of 0% for a threshold shift &gt; or = 20 dB at any frequency and a false-positive rate of 2% for a threshold shift &gt;10 dB at two consecutive frequencies.CONCLUSIONS: This study verified that the output of high-frequency audiometers at 0 dB HL using Sennheiser HDA 200 earphones should equal the 1998 interim ISO RETSPLs from 8 to 16 kHz. Further, because the differences between repeated thresholds were well within +/-10 dB and had an extremely low false-positive rate in reference to the ASHA 1994 criteria for a significant threshold shift due to ototoxicity, a Sennheiser HDA 200 earphone can be used for serial monitoring to determine whether significant high-frequency threshold shifts have occurred for patients receiving potentially ototoxic drug therapy."
"11320877","[Injuries in the throat-nose-ear area by automobile air bags].","BACKGROUND: Airbags are successful in avoiding or in reducing serious injuries caused by motor vehicle accidents. On the other hand airbag deployment has led to a new kind of injuries. Only a few publications about that item exist. The experiences made with two patients after airbag deployment are described. The relevant literature is discussed.PATIENTS: Two patients after airbag injuries were examined. The face of the first patient hit a regularly expanding airbag. Afterwards his nose was obviously deformed. In the other case both front airbags of a car burst triggered by a frontal crash. The symptoms of this patient were painful itching skinlesions in his face, unilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.RESULTS: The first described patient had a clinical and radiological provable fracture of his nasal bone with a frontal impression. The facial skin of the other patient was etched by the filling gas of the airbags. He was also suffering from an acoustic trauma. These cases are compared to other cases found in the literature.CONCLUSIONS: Oto-rhino-laryngological injuries can be caused by airbag deployment, especially by bursting airbags. Beside of outward injuries like dermatological hurts and fractures of the facial skeleton also more serious and life-threatening traumata can occur with damage of the cervical spine and upper airway. Moreover otologic handicaps like temporary or permanent hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, otalgia and tympanic membrane perforations are possible consequences."

"11314916","The human temporary threshold shift after exposure to 60 minutes' noise in an aerobics class.","The potential hazard of noise to hearing is well documented. However, there are some experiences of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) that are not so well-known, for example the effects of leisure noise, and in particular, leisure noise experienced during an aerobics class. A preliminary study of the noise level in aerobics classes in the Manchester region was carried out and their mean noise level was found to be 89.6 dB(A) (+/-4.7 dB(A)). Pure tone thresholds in the audible frequency range were obtained from 28 young adult volunteers (mean age 21 years; standard deviation (SD) 2.3 years) and 14 subjects (the 'exposure' group) were then invited to join (but not participate in) an aerobics class (mean noise level 91.8 dB(A) (+/-1.5 dB(A)) for 60 minutes. The noise levels in the aerobics class were monitored throughout the 60 minutes and the subjects did not stray from a small marked area (2 m2). Subjects' hearing thresholds were obtained for a second time, beginning within 2 minutes of the cessation of the noise, and any temporary threshold shifts (TTS) were noted. A second group of 14 subjects (the control group) was invited for a second audiogram after at least 60 minutes, during which time subjects were not exposed to any noise. The data obtained here were analysed and of the 14 subjects in the exposure group all had significant TTS at all frequencies except 1,000 Hz. Subjects in the control group, who had not experienced any noise, showed significantly reduced hearing thresholds (all frequencies; p&gt;0.02), showing evidence of a possible practice effect with audiometric testing."
"11296936","Association of leisure-time noise exposure and hearing loss.","The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of noisy leisure activities with hearing loss. Participants (n=3571) were examined in a population-based study of age-related hearing loss conducted in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. Hearing thresholds were determined by audiometry. Hearing loss was defined as the pure-tone average of the frequencies 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 Hz greater than 25 dB HL in either ear. Information regarding exposure to leisure-time noise was obtained by interview. After adjusting for potential confounders, individuals who engaged in leisure activities with average sound levels greater than 90 dBA were significantly more likely to have a hearing loss than participants who did not engage in noisy leisure activities (OR=1.11, 95 per cent CI=1.01-1.22). Individuals who engaged in woodworking were 30 per cent more likely to have a hearing loss than those who had never done woodworking. There was a 6 per cent increased risk of hearing loss for each 5-year period of participation. Health care professionals should consider counseling their patients who engage in noisy leisure activities about the risk of noise-induced hearing loss."
"11257914","Noise-induced hearing loss among textile workers in Lagos metropolis.","A cross-sectional sample of 204 textile workers was selected randomly from all sections (including the non-production areas), and was initially screened to exclude subjects with pathological middle ear as well as those currently working in sections classified as non-noise but who had been exposed to excessive noise in the past. A total of 17 workers were thus excluded leaving 187 who were then assessed by means of air-conduction and bone-conduction audiograms obtained by the use of a manual (medicor-SA 3L), pure-tone audiometer. All audiometric tests were preceded by an otological examination to rule out the presence of any significant aural pathological conditions. The subjects were divided into 3 groups, based on the noise levels observed at their worksites using a Bruel and Kjaer type 2225 (integrating) sound level meter viz: the noise-exposed group (noise levels &gt; 90 dBA); the less-noise-exposed group (noise levels 85-90 dBA); and the non-noise-exposed group (noise levels &lt; 85 dBA). A comparative analysis of the data on hearing threshold levels of the 3 groups showed that the noise-exposed group had significantly (P &lt; 0.05) elevated hearing threshold levels at all frequencies and in each age group, although the maximal threshold shifts were observed at the 4000 Hz frequency. Also, the hearing threshold levels for the noise-exposed group increased with the duration of noise exposure. The study clearly showed the deleterious effects of uncontrolled occupational noise exposure on unprotected workers. A very high prevalence rate of noise-induced hearing loss (79.8%) was recorded for the noise-exposed group. The less-noise-exposed group recorded a comparatively low figure of 11.3%. The weaving section alone recorded the highest prevalence rate of 84.5%, followed very closely by the spinning section with 71.0%. The lowest prevalence rate (2.9%) was recorded for the administrative staff."

Multiple logistic regression analysis was used in this study to determine which factors were most strongly related to outcome for patients with AAT.METHODS: The study group was comprised of 52 patients (52 ears). Separate analyses were performed on the no change and partial recovery groups, and on the no change and full recovery groups. The following eight factors were examined as explanatory variables, age; number of days before the start of treatment; use of earplugs; drug therapy (adrenocortical hormones, low molecular weight dextrans, and vitamin B12), mean hearing levels at 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz (pure tone average, PTA), and mean hearing levels at 4 and 8 kHz (high tone average, HTA).RESULTS: Factors determined to be most strongly related to outcome were the number of days before the start of treatment, PTA, and HTA. No significant relation to outcome was determined for the five following factors, age; use of earplugs; and drug therapy (adrenocortical hormones, low molecular weight dextrans, and vitamin B12).CONCLUSION: Our results will increase the ability to prognosticate the outcome for AAT."
"11196097","[Danger from exploding fireworks and blank firearms].","Explosive amusement and deterrent articles such as New Year's Eve cannons and rockets, toy pistols, and blank guns are not at all harmless items. Their potential dangerousness is often extremely underestimated. Two damaging mechanisms are important: during explosions, high pressures and temperatures develop and a considerable sound pressure level can be measured. If the explosion happens near the human body (intentionally or inadvertently), not only superficial lesions can occur, but also (mainly due to contact shots) serious, deep-seated tissue damage, especially in the head and neck region with its endangered sense organs such as eye and ear, the vessels and nerves supplying the brain, the speech- and voice-forming apparatus, and in particular the face, can be the consequence. Their mutilation can lead to serious and extensive interpersonalchanges. Accidents are published in the relevant otological and forensic medical papers, but nevertheless it seems important to us to point out the dangerousness of these readily available items."
"10753434","Tinnitus program at Brasília University Medical School.","Over the last 6 months, all patients seen at the otologic clinic of Brasília University Medical School answered a questionnaire designed to identify and describe the symptom of tinnitus. A total of 500 patients reported and described this symptom. They underwent physical examination, laboratory tests and audiological evaluation. In their order of frequency, presbycusis, chronic otitis media, otosclerosis, acoustic trauma, Menière's disease, ototoxicity, and vestibular schwannoma were found. Tinnitus was rated as minor in 81%, moderate in 18%, and severely disabling in 1%. Those who requested treatment for tinnitus were treated medically. Central vasodilators, vestibular suppressants, calcium channel blockers, anticholinergic drugs, anticonvulsant drugs, and gingko biloba were used with variable results. Tinnitus maskers were not used, but hearing prostheses were fitted when indicated. Treatment failed in the 1% with severe disabling tinnitus, and they were entered in a double-blind, randomized protocol for intratympanic dexamethasone injection. Under topical anesthesia, 0.2 ml of a 4-mg/ml dexamethasone solution (0.8 mg per injection) or 0.2 ml of normal saline was injected just posterior to the umbo. Patients remained supine for 20 minutes with the injected ear up and received four injections at 1-week intervals. Preliminary results are reported. Tinnitus is a very frequent symptom among our otologic patients, but most of them would not mention the symptom spontaneously, probably because for 81% it was mild. Curiously, the 5% of the severely disabling type tend to exhibit no clear cause, whereas the mild and moderate cases usually have an identifiable etiology."

Drivers were interviewed using questionnaires on job history, shift work and vacation schedules and underwent clinical and laboratory examinations including measures of blood pressure, pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry, and anthropometric data analysis after an informed consent was obtained.RESULTS: The prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss was 32.7%. According to Merluzzi's classification, 91.2% (31 cases) were classified as first and second-degree losses and the most affected frequencies were 6 kHz in 61.3%, and 4 kHz in 38.7%. There were no differences in the laterality of the first affected ear. The prevalence of arterial hypertension was 13.2% (PAD &gt; or =90 mmHg; PAS &gt; or =140 mmHg).CONCLUSIONS: The risk of noise-induced hearing loss was greater for drivers in job for more than 6 years, after controlling for age-related hearing loss.

"12433419","Linear and nonlinear transient evoked otoacoustic emissions in humans exposed to noise.","Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) have been analyzed in a population of 134 ears, divided into three classes: (1) nonexposed ears in bilaterally normal hearing subjects, (2) audiometrically normal ears of subjects exposed to noise and affected by unilateral high-frequency (f&gt;3 kHz) hearing loss in the contralateral ear, and (3) the contralateral impaired ears of the exposed subjects. The statistical distributions of global and spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were analyzed. TEOAEs were recorded both in the linear and nonlinear acquisition mode to evaluate the effectiveness of two standard averaging techniques with respect to their sensitivity to the early effects of noise exposure. Good discrimination between nonexposed and exposed ears was obtained using either the linear or the nonlinear mode. Despite its intrinsically higher SNR, the linear mode is not more sensitive than the nonlinear mode for this purpose because it is not possible to find a window for effectively cancelling the linear artifact while keeping a suitable sensitivity to the short-latency high-frequency aspect of the response. Moreover, with respect to another measurable parameter, the TEOAE latency, good discrimination is obtained only by using the nonlinear mode because, again, the linear artifact masks the high-frequency TEOAE response."

"12186037","Distribution of risk factors for hearing loss: implications for evaluating risk of occupational noise-induced hearing loss.","This paper presents an analysis of hearing threshold levels among 2066 white male workers employed in various U.S. industries studied in the 1968-72 NIOSH Occupational Noise and Hearing Survey (ONHS). The distribution of hearing threshold levels (HTL) is examined in relation to various risk factors (age, prior occupational noise, medical conditions) for hearing loss among a population of noise exposed and control (low noise-exposed) industrial workers. Previous analyses of a subset of these data from the ONHS focused on 1172 highly &quot;screened&quot; workers. An additional 894 male workers (609 noise-exposed and 285 controls), who were excluded for various reasons (i.e., nonoccupational noise exposure, otologic or medical conditions affecting hearing, prior occupational noise exposure) have been added to examine hearing loss in an unscreened population. Data are analyzed by age, duration of exposure, and sound level (8-h TWA) by individual test frequency. Results indicate that hearing threshold levels are higher among unscreened noise-exposed and control workers relative to screened workers. Analysis of risk factors such as nonoccupational noise exposure, medical conditions, and type of industry among unscreened controls indicated that these factors were not significantly associated with increased mean HTLs or risk of material impairment over and above what is expected due to age. Age-specific mean hearing threshold levels (and percentiles of the distribution) among the unscreened ONHS control population may be used as a comparison population of low-noise exposed white male industrial workers for evaluating the effectiveness of hearing conservation programs for workers less than 55 years of age. To make valid inferences regarding occupational noise-induced hearing loss, it is important to use hearing data from reference (control) populations that are similar with respect to the degree of subject screening, type of work force (blue vs white collar), and the distribution of other risk factors for hearing loss."

"11987497","[Hearing disability in relation to audiometric threshold values: hypothesis on the determination of the onset of hearing loss].","BACKGROUND: The term auditory disability (AD) means the presence of auditory symptoms due to hearing loss. Until now the audiometric threshold cut-off between the presence or absence of AD was not clear.OBJECTIVES: In this study we attempted to define the value of audiometric threshold that could be considered as the limit between the presence or absence of weakness of auditory function, considered as the threshold as the 95th percentile of subjects that did not report AD.METHODS: The study group consisted of 1641 males, 891 normally hearing and 750 affected by noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) Each subject was submitted to a questionnaire specifically created in order to determine the presence of AD.RESULTS: Statistical analysis confirmed the reliability of answers to items. AD was present in 577 subjects, not all affected by NIHL. Audiometric threshold and age correlated significatively with the degree of AD.CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained allowed the audiometric threshold values to be determined at the 95th percentile of subjects who did not report AD, in relation to the average of frequencies normally used in hearing loss evaluation."
"11936172","Hearing loss and hearing handicap in users of recreational firearms.","This investigation sought to establish the prevalence of hearing loss and hearing handicap in a population of 232 recreational firearm users. Hearing handicap was calculated based on four methods using pure-tone threshold data from the American Academy of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, and American Speech-Language and Hearing Association in addition to the self-report Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults-Screener (HHIA-S). Subjects (45 female and 187 male) ranging in age from 13 to 77 years (mean = 40 years, SD = 15.1) completed a short questionnaire regarding demographics and shooting practices followed by pure-tone air audiometry at Occupational Safety and Health Administration test frequencies of 500 to 6000 Hz. A total of 177 who exhibited varying degrees of hearing loss also received a face-to-face administration of the HHIA-S. Audiometric and HHIA-S results revealed that both high-frequency hearing loss and hearing handicap varied significantly as functions of age and occupation. Significant gender effects were observed audiometrically but not as a function of hearing handicap. HHIA-S scores varied significantly as a function of high-frequency (1000-4000 Hz) hearing loss. Correlation coefficients between the four different pure-tone methods of calculating hearing handicap and the self-reported HHIA-S were highest for pure-tone methods that do not employ 500 Hz in the calculation."
"11903364","The Audioscan: a high frequency resolution audiometric technique and its clinical applications.","The Audioscan is a form of high definition audiometry based on iso-hearing level frequency sweeps, which was developed by Meyer-Bisch in 1990. Compared with traditional tone audiometry, it sweeps across the preset frequency range at a predetermined sweep rate and provides a continuous audiometric curve. Because the device has a maximum frequency range of 125-16 000 Hz with 64 frequencies per octave, the Audioscan method can, theoretically, give 64 times as many values as fixed-frequency audiometry, which may give greater accuracy and sensitivity. An advantage of this is its capacity to detect mild audiometric deficits such as narrow notches situated between the frequencies normally tested. These may represent very limited auditory lesions, at a stage when they cannot be detected by routine audiological methods. Thus, the Audioscan method can give not only a detailed audiometric curve, but also provide important indicators of mild auditory dysfunction. The Audioscan device (e.g. Essilor model) is commercially available for clinical purpose. It is a software-based system, which can also be used for pure tone audiometry and Békésy audiometry. This paper reviews the general aspects of the Audioscan technique and current applications for detecting auditory dysfunction. This would be valuable to provide some guidelines on the Audioscan assessment, and contribute to a clarification of the clinical application of Audioscan and facilitate further research."
"11860642","Identification of the auditory hazards of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.","The aim of this work was to determine the effect of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) on the hearing of both patients and staff members exposed to such treatment. It used different hearing screening instruments, and compared the sensitivity of these instruments for the detection of the earliest change in hearing induced by this procedure. The results of this study show that ESWL has a potentially hazardous effect on hearing. This effect is subtle, could only be detected by transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE), and is manifested in some of the subjects under study as temporary subjective hearing loss and tinnitus, reflecting a state of temporary biomechanical derangement of the outer hair cells. This effect seems to be related to the frequency of exposure to ESWL."
"11763114","Hearing loss in space.","BACKGROUND: Temporary and, in some cases, permanent hearing loss has been documented after long-duration spaceflights.METHODS: We examined all existing published data on hearing loss after space missions to characterize the losses.RESULTS: Data from Russian missions suggest that the hearing loss, when it occurs, affects mainly mid to high frequencies and that using hearing protection often might prevent the loss. Several significant questions remain about hearing loss in space. While the hearing loss has been presumed to be noise-induced, no clear link has been established between noise exposure and hearing loss during spaceflight. In one documented case of temporary hearing loss from the Shuttle-Mir program, the pattern of loss was atypical for a noise-induced loss. Continuous noise levels that have been measured on the Mir and previous space stations, while above engineering standards, are not at levels usually associated with hearing loss in ground-based studies (which have usually been limited to 8-10 h exposure periods). Attempts to measure hearing in space using threshold-based audiograms have been unsuccessful in both the American and Russian programs due to noise interference with the measurements.CONCLUSIONS: The existing data highlight the need for reliable monitoring of both hearing and noise in long-duration spaceflight."
"14689639","A comparison between middle latency responses and late auditory evoked potentials for approximating frequency-specific hearing levels in medicolegal patients with occupational hearing loss.","To evaluate the medicolegal relevance of middle latency responses for objectively approximating frequency-specific hearing levels in subjects with occupational hearing loss, we compared the middle latency response with the cortical response in 22 reliable subjects who had noise-induced hearing loss and were submitting claims for compensation and 21 subjects who had noise-induced hearing loss but were exaggerating the level of this loss and also were submitting claims for compensation. Middle latency components of auditory evoked potentials, especially the time-saving 40-Hz response, seem efficient and reliable for evaluating the true pure-tone thresholds (1, 2, and 3 kHz). A good correlation exists between the 40-Hz response threshold and the slow vertex response (SVR) threshold (long latency). Both also show a fairly close correlation with behavioral thresholds in cooperating subjects. However, in most cases, the 40-Hz response is less sensitive (mode of difference, 10 dB) than is the SVR. As middle latency response audiometry is not actually a time-saving procedure in comparison with cortical evoked response audiometry and as it seems less sensitive than the SVR for approximating the true threshold, the use of middle latency response audiometry seems best limited to situations in which a control or a confirmation of the SVR is wanted. Further information about the sensitivity of middle latency response to drug effects and to subject wakefulness (specifically, whether the patient is more or less sleepy) is expected."
"14689633","Sonovestibular symptoms evaluated by computed dynamic posturography.","The investigation of stability under bilateral acoustic stimulation was undertaken in an attempt to mimic the real-life conditions of noisy environment (e.g., industry, aviation). The Tullio phenomenon evaluated by computed dynamic posturography (CDP) under acoustic stimulation is reflected in postural unsteadiness, rather than in the classic nystagmus. With such a method, the dangerous effects of noise-induced instability can be assessed and prevented. Three groups of subjects were submitted. The first (group A) included 20 patients who complained of sonovestibular symptoms (i.e., Tullio phenomenon) on the background of an inner-ear disease. The second group (B) included 20 neurootological patients without a history of Tullio phenomenon. Group C consisted of 20 patients with normal hearing, as controls. A pure-tone stimulus of 1,000 Hz at 110 dB was delivered binaurally for 20 seconds during condition 5 and condition 6 of the CDP sensory organization test. The sequence of six sensory organization conditions was performed three times with two intermissions of 15-20 minutes between the trials. The first was performed in the regular mode (quiet stance). This was followed 20 minutes by a trial carried out in quiet stance in sensory organizations tests (SOTs) 1 through 4, and with acoustic stimulation in SOT 5 and SOT 6. The last test was performed in quiet stance throughout (identical to the first trial). A significant drop in the composite equilibrium score was witnessed in group A patients upon acoustic stimulation (p &lt; .0001). This imbalance did not disappear completely until 20 minutes later when the third sensory organization trial was performed. In fact, the composite score obtained on the last SOT was still significantly worse than the baseline. Group B and the normal subjects (group C) showed no significant change in composite score. As regards the vestibular ratio score, again, group A marked a drop on stimulation with sound (p &lt; .004). This decrease contrasted once more with the other two groups. The leading sensory organization pattern was vestibular dysfunction (i.e., 40%, 10%, and 0% before acoustic stimulation in groups A, B, and C, respectively). The initial proportion of vestibular dysfunction increased on acoustic stimulation to 55% in group A, but this subsequently decreased in the third trial. The percentages of vestibular dysfunction remained constant during repeated trials in the other two groups. The positive medical history of sonovestibular symptoms was confirmed objectively by CDP with sound stimulation with a high statistical significance. This establishes the described method as a sensitive testing technique for validating the existence of the Tullio phenomenon in patients with a variety of disorders of the inner ear, especially chronic noise-induced hearing loss and acute acoustic trauma. All patients who suffered phonic trauma, chronic exposure to noise (e.g., aviation employees, industry and army personnel), or other neurootological disorders and who complain of sonovestibular symptoms should be tested for the presence of the Tullio phenomenon. This should be carried out preferably by means of CDP with acoustic stimulation for an objective corroboration of their complaint before continuing activity in a noisy environment, thus preventing dangerous loss of balance when exposed to noise."
"14689614","Cortical evoked response audiometry thresholds and neuroleptic, sedative, hypnotic drugs.","Cortical evoked response audiometry is adequate for approximating hearing threshold levels with frequency specificity when the psychoacoustic responses lack reliability and reproducibility (compensation claim). It is well-known that control of wakefulness is essential for the reliability of slow vertex responses (SVR). Therefore, sedative, hypnotic, and neuroleptic drugs are supposed to have possible adverse effects on the detection of SVR. In contrast, brainstem evoked responses (BER) have proved not to be significantly affected by therapeutic doses of these compounds. The purpose of our study was to assess the reliability of SVR-threshold definition in subjects taking neuroleptic, sedative, and hypnotic drugs. Fifteen subjects examined for occupational hearing loss at the Fund for Occupational Diseases in Brussels and regularly taking one or several of these drugs were compared with 27 comparable controls. In each subject the auditory thresholds were defined with both techniques: SVR (1, 2, and 3 kHz) and BER (clicks). A highly significant difference is observed between the two groups: In the group receiving drugs, the SVR threshold for 3 kHz is 12.1 dB (average) higher than the BER threshold, whereas in the group without drugs, the SVR threshold for 3 kHz is 7.77 dB (average) lower than the BER threshold. In the drug group, large interindividual differences are observed. It may be concluded that the use of neuroleptics, sedatives, and hypnotics renders the auditory threshold definition with SVR completely unreliable. In using SVR for medicolegal threshold definition, controlling the 3-kHz threshold with BER always is necessary."
"14618174","[Hearing loss caused by noise, otitis and head injuries].","BACKGROUND: Results from a recent study of the population in Nord-Trøndelag County are described and estimates given of the magnitude of hearing loss associated with occupational and leisure noise exposure, recurrent ear infections and head injury.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Self reported exposure data were collected by questionnaires and hearing acuity was measured by pure tone audiometry. There were complete data from 50 132 subjects above the age of 19. Effects of various risk factors were estimated using multivariate methods.RESULTS: Noise, ear infections and head injury explained 1-6% of the variance (varying with age, sex and frequency range), apart from what could be explained by age alone (30-58%). The strongest effects were from occupational noise and impulse noise (gun blasts) among middle-aged and older men. Only moderate effects of noise could be detected among women. No effects of amplified music or use of personal stereo players could be demonstrated. There were clear effects of recurrent ear infections and head injury.INTERPRETATIONS: With the possible exception of substantial effects of recurrent ear infections and impulse noise, our results give grounds for somewhat more optimism than most previous results about risk factors for hearing loss."
"14606597","Correlation between blood group and noise-induced hearing loss.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between blood group and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted in 176 factory workers who had been exposed to a noise level of 85-90 dB for 8 h a day for a period of &gt; or = 10 years. Pure-tone audiometric measurements were performed in a standard silent room. The blood groups of the workers were obtained from the factory files.RESULTS: NIHL was found in 23 (32.0%), 35 (58.3%), 10 (38.5%) and 7 (38.9%) persons with blood groups A, O, B and AB, respectively. NIHL was determined to be significantly more frequent in workers with blood group O.CONCLUSION: We suggest that people with blood group O are more prone to develop NIHL."
"14558892","The influence of ageing on noise-induced hearing loss.","A lifetime of exposure to noise is likely to have negative effects on the hearing, but the interaction between noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and age-related hearing loss is difficult to determine. The most commonly accepted assumption is a simple accumulating effects of noise and ageing on the hearing. However, both a less than additive effect as well as a supraadditive effect has been proposed. Recently an interesting interaction between NIHL and age-related hearing loss has been reported (Gates et al., 2000). NIHL before old age reduces the effects of ageing at noise-associated frequencies, but accelerates the deterioration of hearing in adjacent frequencies. Findings from the longitudinal and cross-sectional gerontological and geriatric population study of 70-year-olds in Gothenburg, Sweden supports these observations. The incidence of tinnitus increases in old age, but not at the same high rate as presbyacusis. According to the gerontological and geriatric population study in Gothenburg tinnitus in old age is related more to hearing loss than to ageing. There are no simple correlations between exposure to noise during the active years and tinnitus in old age."
"14502772","Perceived and measured hearing ability in construction laborers and farmers.","BACKGROUND: Construction and farming are characterized by small independently operated enterprises; few are included in hearing loss prevention programs. This study describes perceived and measured hearing ability among construction laborers and farmers in order to further the Healthy People 2010 goal to reduce noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).METHODS: Construction laborers (n = 147) and farmers (n = 150) had screening audiograms at their workplace and a farm show, respectively. The relationship of the audiograms with a one-item measure of perceived hearing ability was explored using non-parametric statistics.RESULTS: At the 4,000 Hz frequency, indicative of NIHL, a high percentage of both groups exhibited hearing loss greater than 25 dB: laborers 53%, farmers 67%. Perceived hearing ability was significantly worse (P &lt; 0.05) for workers with a measured hearing loss. The sensitivities of perceived hearing loss compared to audiometry ranged from 0.30 to 0.72 suggesting that perceived hearing loss was not a good indicator of actual hearing loss in this sample.CONCLUSIONS: The poor relationship between perceived and actual hearing loss in this study suggests that best practice requires inclusion of audiometric screening as part of a complete hearing loss prevention program. Future development of an improved instrument to measure perceived hearing ability may be useful in assessing this dimension of hearing."
"14501448","Hearing loss after direct blunt neck trauma.","OBJECTIVE: To report for the first time hearing impairment resulting from blunt neck trauma.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of clinical, pure tone, and speech audiometric findings. The first obtained within 3 months and the follow-up ones between 6 and 12 months after injury. Three representative examples are given.PATIENTS: Eighty-three patients (166 ears) who reported hearing impairment after blunt neck trauma.RESULTS: Twenty of the 166 ears (12%) had normal hearing and 137 ears (81.3%) showed an acoustic trauma-like hearing impairment. Eight ears (4.8%) had a hearing loss of at least 30 dB in the speech frequencies (500-2,000 Hz) and two ears (1.2%) had additional impairment in the higher frequencies. Only one ear (0.8%) had a conductive hearing loss. No speech discrimination score was poorer than 80%. Forty-six subjects (55.4%) reported tinnitus.CONCLUSIONS: Blunt neck trauma, like whiplash injury, may cause objectively measurable hearing impairment."
"12941983","[Findings of standard and high-frequency audiometry in workers exposed to occupational noise for long durations].","OBJECTIVES: Changes in hearing thresholds were determined by standard and high-frequency audiometry in subjects exposed to occupational noise for long durations.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Hearing thresholds were measured between 250 and 16000 Hz frequencies by standard and high-frequency audiometry in 64 male workers (mean age 42 years; range 31 to 55 years) of a hydroelectric power plant and in 30 age- and sex-matched controls with no hearing problems. The workers were divided into three groups according to the noise level and into four groups according to the duration of exposure.RESULTS: The mean hearing thresholds of workers showed significant increases in all frequencies from 4000 to 16000 Hz (p&lt;0.005), the most affected frequencies being 4000, 6000, 14000, and 16000 Hz (p&lt;0.0005). Increases in hearing thresholds were significantly correlated with the noise level and duration of exposure to noise (p&lt;0.05).CONCLUSION: The results suggest that high-frequency audiometry should be used together with standard audiometry in the detection and follow-up of individuals who are at potential risks for hearing losses."
"12937701","[Hearing health of workers exposed to noise and insecticides].","OBJECTIVE: To examine the peripheral auditory disorders in a group of workers exposed to organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides, used in vector control campaigns.METHODS: The prevalence study examined a population of 98 individuals who sprayed insecticides in campaigns for the prevention of Dengue, Chagas disease and Yellow fever. The sampling approach was finalistic, and included the workers in a health district of Pernambuco, during the year 2000. A questionnaire was used to collect data on occupational and non-occupational risks, safety measures utilized, family history of auditory problems and health symptoms. Previous noise exposure history was also investigated, since noise can be a confounding factor for hearing loss. Hearing sensitivity and middle ear function were assessed by pure tone audiometry.RESULTS: Among those exposed to insecticides, 63.8% demonstrated a hearing loss. For the group of workers exposed to both noise and insecticides, hearing loss was observed in 66.7% of the cases. The median exposure time necessary to detect high-frequency losses was 3.4 years for workers exposed to both agents and 7.3 years for workers exposed to insecticides only. Hearing thresholds were poorest among workers exposed to both agents. Auditory damage for those with combined exposures to the two factors was more severe than the hearing losses observed among those exposed only to insecticides.CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that exposure to insecticides was associated with peripheral sensorioneural hearing loss and that noise exposure can potentiate the ototoxic effects of insecticides. It is necessary to evaluate this possible association through epidemiological studies."
"12890658","Occupational toluene exposure and auditory function: results from a follow-up study.","The ototoxicity of occupational exposure to toluene below 50 p.p.m. was investigated in a longitudinal study over 5 yr with four repeated examinations starting with 333 male workers from rotogravure printing plants. Past lifetime weighted average exposures (LWAE) to toluene and noise were determined from individual work histories; recent individual exposures were measured 10 times during the study (toluene, active sampling; noise, stationary measurements). The auditory thresholds were measured with pure tone audiometry. The mean LWAE exposures to toluene and noise were 45 +/- 17 p.p.m. plus 82 +/- 7 dB(A) for printers (high toluene intensity) and 10 +/- 7 p.p.m. plus 82 +/- 4 dB(A) for end-processors (low toluene intensity). The mean current exposures to toluene and noise during the study were 26 +/- 20 p.p.m. plus 81 +/- 4 dB(A) for printers and 3 +/- 3 p.p.m. plus 82 +/- 4 dB(A) for end-processors. Repeated measurement analyses (grouping factors: toluene intensity, exposure duration and noise intensity) and logistic regressions did not reveal significant effects of toluene intensity, of exposure duration and of interactions between toluene intensity and noise intensity. The stratification dependent on noise intensity itself [79 +/- 3 versus 84 +/- 1 dB(A)] was significantly associated with the auditory thresholds. Regarding the missing toluene effects, it was concluded that the threshold level for developing a hearing loss as a result of occupational toluene exposure might be above the actual limit of 50 p.p.m."
"12830845","Perceived effects of high frequency hearing loss in a farming population.","Previous research has suggested that farmers are at increased risk for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) due to excessive amounts of loud noise exposure from farming equipment. This study was conducted to determine the perceived effects of hearing loss in a small farming population. Ninety-three subjects, ranging in age from 18 to 75 years and actively engaged in the farming industry, were asked to complete a case history form regarding noise exposure and demographic information. Hearing sensitivity was assessed by obtaining air conduction thresholds at audiometric test frequencies 500-8000 Hz bilaterally. Subjects completed the Self Assessment of Communication (SAC) hearing handicap scale if any threshold in either ear was poorer than 25 dB HL. Study results revealed that the presence of high-frequency hearing loss and perceived hearing handicap increased with age, with the largest effects seen in those over 50 years of age. The, relationship between SAC scores and four hearing handicap formulae utilizing different pure-tone averages was also investigated. The highest correlation coefficients occurred for formulae employing higher frequencies and excluding 500 Hz in the calculation. Implications of this study are that audiologists should be aware of the potential hearing handicap associated with high-frequency hearing loss in the farming population and educational programs concerning the dangers of noise and ways to prevent NIHL should be developed for those in farming occupations."
"12768684","[Application of extended high frequency audiometry in the early diagnosis of noise--induced hearing loss].","OBJECTIVE: To assess the application of 10-20 kHz audiometry in early diagnosis of noise-induced hearing loss and to explore the relationship between hearing loss and subjects' age, the exposure time as well as the noise level.METHODS: One thousand workers with noise exposure history were examined by pure tone audiometry(0.5-20 kHz). One hundred and twenty normal subjects served as the control group.RESULTS: The noise levels at working sites ranged from 95 to 115dB(A). Compared with the control group, noise-exposed subjects showed minor changes in the thresholds from 0.5 to 6 KHz, whereas the thresholds were elevated in the high frequency range of 10-16 kHz (P &lt; 0.001). The incidence of ears without any response to the maximum output at the frequency range of 14 to 20 kHz was much higher (P &lt; 0.01) than that of the control group. In the animals exposed to noise, the thresholds of 10-18 kHz increased with the aging and with increase of working time (6-10 years), but there were no significant differences among subjects exposed to the noises at different levels(P &gt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: In noise-exposed ears, the occurrence of threshold changes in the high frequency range (10 to 20 kHz) is earlier than that in the low frequency range (0.5 to 6 kHz). Aging and working time also affect the 10-20 kHz hearing thresholds. The lack of responses to maximum output and the changes in thresholds in the high frequency range (10-20 kHz) can be used as indices for the diagnosis of early noise-induced hearing loss and for the assessment of the susceptibility of the subject to noise damage."
"12761711","Rapid recovery from acoustic trauma: chicken soup, potato knish, or drug interaction?","OBJECTIVES: To describe the phenomenology and consider possible mechanisms mediating rapid and unexpected recovery from acoustic trauma after ingestion of a food substance (potato knish).STUDY DESIGN: Single subject with repeated test measures.SETTING: Regional Veteran's Administration Medical Center, tertiary care medical center.METHODS: Pure-tone audiometry and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) performed at 6 days, 21 days, and 1 year postexposure.RESULTS: Medical treatment with corticosteriods and a diuretic alone failed to improve auditory function and related symptoms (tinnitus and aural fullness) over a 2-week period. Rapid recovery of auditory function (dramatic improvement in pure tone thresholds; reappearance of DPOAEs) and abatement of related symptoms directly followed physiologic reactions from ingesting a food substance.CONCLUSIONS: Rapid recovery from acoustic trauma was temporally correlated with urodynamic and cardiovascular reactions from ingesting food containing sulfite preservative, a substance to which the individual was allergic. Factors that may have contributed to recovery of function include massive diuresis, increased heart rate, release of biochemical mediators, mediator-induced vasodilatation, and changes in vascular or cell membrane permeability. Establishing relationships that lead to recovery of function from acoustic trauma may facilitate research and aid in the development of new treatment options for this condition."
"12755754","Objective assessment of auditory thresholds in noise-induced hearing loss using steady-state evoked potentials.","The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether steady-state evoked potential (SSEP) can be used for objective estimation of auditory thresholds in patients with noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Eleven subjects (22 ears) with a characteristic audiometric notch between 3000 and 6000 Hz participated in this study. Both pure-tone thresholds and SSEP thresholds were obtained for each ear of all subjects. The correlation of SSEP thresholds and pure-tone thresholds was assessed. The results show that SSEP thresholds predicted pure-tone thresholds with correlation coefficients (r) of 0.86, 0.92, 0.94 and 0.95 at 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz respectively. Typically, the SSEP thresholds overestimate the pure-tone thresholds by 10-20 dB, but they closely reflect the configuration of the audiogram. The strength of the relationship between SSEP and pure-tone thresholds increased with increasing frequency and increasing degree of hearing loss. In conclusion, SSEP can be used as a reliable and objective tool to assess auditory thresholds in patients with noise-induced hearing loss with high-frequency dips."
"12701733","Effect of ipsilateral and contralateral low-frequency narrow-band noise on temporary threshold shift in humans.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of ipsilateral and contralateral low-frequency (250 Hz) narrow-band noise (NBN) on the temporary threshold shift (TTS) induced by a 2 kHz tone in young normally hearing subjects with a functioning auditory efferent system.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixteen young volunteers served as subjects. All the subjects were young (20-30 years), disease-free and had a medical history negative for otological disease, noise exposure and use of ototoxic drugs. They had normal hearing [thresholds of 125-8,000 Hz below 20 dB hearing level (HL)], transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions and contralateral suppression. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of three different groups. Subjects in Group A (n = 5) were exposed to a 90 dB HL 2 kHz pure tone for 10 min. Subjects in Group B (n = 6) were exposed to a 90 dB HL 2 kHz pure tone and an ipsilateral 45 dB HL 250 Hz NBN for 10 min. Subjects in Group C (n = 5) were exposed to a 90 dB HL 2 kHz pure tone and a contralateral 45 dB HL 250 Hz NBN for 10 min. The right ear served as the test ear. The TTS 2 min after the end of the exposure (TTS2) was measured in all subjects at 2, 3 and 4 kHz.RESULTS: TTS, in Group A was significantly higher at 3 kHz (p = 0.011) and at 4 kHz (p = 0.003) than TTS2 in Group B. At 4 kHz, TTS2 in Group C was significantly higher (p = 0.013) than TTS2 in Group B. Although TTS2 in Group C was lower than TTS2 in Group A, this difference was not significant. The presence of an ipsilateral low-frequency NBN significantly reduced TTS2 induced by a 90 dB HL 2 kHz tone. A contralateral low-frequency NBN reduced TTS2 in this group of subjects; however, the reduction was not significant.CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that an ipsilateral low-intensity, low-frequency (250 Hz) NBN can give protection from a TTS induced by a 2 kHz tone. Contralateral low-frequency NBN did not induce any protective effect."
"12693766","Prevalence of hearing disorders in Singapore military conscripts: a role for routine audiometry screening?","AIM: To determine the prevalence of hearing disorders in Singapore military conscripts and describe the profile of hearing loss and associated risk factors.METHODS: Population-based descriptive analysis of randomised cohort of 818 Singapore military conscripts presenting for medical examination, using self-administered questionnaire and pure tone audiometry performed for both ears. Main outcome measures are prevalence rate of hearing loss and relative risk of hearing loss by demographic factors and surrogates for noise exposure.RESULTS: Prevalence of hearing loss was 36.7 per 1,000 (95% CI 24.8, 51.9). Of 30 subjects with hearing loss, 19 (63.3%) had loss at high frequency, 7 (23.3%) at low frequency, and 4 (13.4%) in both ranges. Hearing loss was unilateral in 17 (56.7%) subjects and bilateral in 13 (43.3%). Relative risk of hearing loss did not differ by age group, education level, race or frequency of personal stereo use. Relative risk of hearing loss is higher in subjects with frequent discotheque visits compared to those who never do so (RR = 2.72, 95%CI 1.09, 6.76).CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of hearing loss in Singapore military conscripts points to the need for routine audiometry screening prior to enlistment. This will be useful in assigning military vocations, in clinical case management, and for assessing cases of noise-induced hearing loss attributable to military service."
"12689510","Is there a gender difference in coping, perceived disability and handicap in patients with noise-induced hearing loss?","Gender differences in coping strategies and self-rated disability and handicap were explored in individuals with noise-induced hearing loss. The study group consisted of 60 male and 33 female patients, consecutively presenting at the hearing clinics in two hospitals in the western part of Sweden. The females were older and had worse average hearing thresholds over the low frequencies (0.5, 1 and 2 kHz) in the better ear than the males. However, all subjects rated their hearing loss as &quot;moderate&quot; to &quot;severe&quot;. The patients responded to the Communication Strategies Scale, CSS, measuring &quot;maladaptive behaviour&quot;, &quot;verbal strategies&quot; and &quot;non-verbal strategies&quot; and the Hearing Disability and Handicaps Scale, HDHS, which is composed of four factorially derived subscales: &quot;speech perception&quot;, &quot;non-speech sounds&quot;, &quot;interpersonal distress&quot; and &quot;threat to the self-image&quot;. Pure-tone audiometry and sociodemographic data was also assessed. Despite differences in pure-tone audiometry, there were no significant differences between gender in perceived disability or handicap. Significant gender differences in coping were found. The women used &quot;maladaptive behaviour&quot; and &quot;verbal strategies&quot; significantly more often than the men. This is in agreement with results of an interview-study of women with NIHL, showing that the perceived emotional temperature in a specific situation guided the choice of coping strategy. The gender difference in coping could also be related to, and explained by, the conversational goal (transactional or interactional)."
"12689480","A clinical evaluation of the hearing disability and handicap scale in men with noise induced hearing loss.","During the last 30 years several hearing disability and handicap questionnaires have been designed and used for clinical purposes.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Hearing Disability and Handicap Scale (HDHS), which is a shortened and modified version of the Hearing Measurement Scale. Correlations between the Hearing Handicap and Support Scale, the Communication Strategy Scale from the Communication Profile of the Hearing Impaired, pure tone audiometry and speech recognition scores in noise were analysed. Data from 168 men with noise induced hearing loss of different degrees was obtained. Also a test-retest was conducted. The disability section of the HDHS seemed accurate but offered no improvement of prediction compared to previous scales. Even though the reliability of the handicap section was sufficient, its validity and clinical use is discussed and suggestions about improvements given. Since standardised scales are necessary if results are to be compared worldwide, guidelines regarding the clinical use and benefit of hearing disability and handicap scales are required."
"12689368","Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions in acute acoustic trauma.","Acute acoustic traumas are caused by exposure to extremely high noise levels ranging from milliseconds to several hours' duration. In pure tone audiometry they range from the C5 dip to basomediocochlear sensorineural hearing loss. Their pathogenesis is assumed to consist of micromechanical-traumatic and biochemical-metabolic damage to the outer hair cells. In order to establish the changes to the DPOAE (distortion products of otoacoustic emissions), 17 patients were examined after sustaining acute acoustic trauma. The causes included firework explosions, anti-tank rocket launchers, vehicle tyre bursting, rock concerts, hand-gun shots, sub-machine gun fire, hand grenade explosion, exploding car battery. The pure tone audiogram, tympanogram, tinnitus maskability and DPOAE (both DP-gram and growth rate in various frequencies) were determined in all patients. If the event had occurred some time ago, measurements were taken only once; in acute cases measurements were repeated at different times. In nine patients with persistent hearing impairment, clear DPs were found in the unaffected frequencies but were completely absent in the affected frequency range. Four of these patients were unilaterally and two patients were bilaterally affected; three patients had a different (not noise-induced) hearing loss on the opposite side. In eight patients with regressive hearing loss, DPs were by contrast detectable throughout the entire frequency range, their amplitudes only rising slightly as hearing recovered. Of these eight patients, three were unilaterally and five bilaterally affected. DPOAE seem to indicate the likelihood of recovery of hearing threshold after an acute acoustic trauma. In cases with DPs completely absent in the affected frequency range, the prognosis seems to be much worse than in cases with present DPs in the frequency range of hearing."
"12641392","Hearing loss induced by noise, ear infections, and head injuries: results from the Nord-Trøndelag Hearing Loss Study.","Pure-tone audiometry was administered to the adult population in Nord-Trøndelag County, Norway, 1995-97. The 51,975 participants also provided questionnaire information about occupational and leisure noise exposure, previous ear infections, and head injury. Values averaged over both ears were calculated for low (250 and 500 Hz), middle (1 and 2 kHz) and high frequencies (3, 4, 6 and 8 kHz). The aim was to estimate the magnitude of hearing loss associated with various types of exposure by age and sex. Noise, ear infections and head injury explained 1-6% of the variance in hearing loss (varying with age, sex, and frequency range), in addition to what could be explained by age alone (30-58%). Only moderate effects of noise could be detected among women. The upper tenth percentile regarding occupational noise among men older than 44 years had on average an 8-9-dB high-frequency loss, adjusted for other predictors. Exposure to impulse noise (hunting, sports shooting) caused a 7-8-dB high-frequency loss in the same group. No significant effects of frequent use of personal stereo players or regular attendance at discotheques or rock concerts could be demonstrated. There were clear effects of recurrent ear infections and head injury."

"12601323","The use of cortical evoked response audiometry in the assessment of noise-induced hearing loss.","OBJECTIVES: The study aims were to determine the incidence of exaggerated hearing thresholds in individuals complaining of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) as a result of impulse noise using cortical evoked response audiometry (CERA) and to identify any associated audiometric features.SETTING: We conducted an office-based study.STUDY DESIGN: In this prospective case series, 1154 males complaining of NIHL were assessed with pure tone audiometry; 673 had CERA. Pure tone averages (PTA) and hearing disability were calculated using the Irish and American Medical Association systems. A PTA of &gt;10 dB worse than the CERA average was considered evidence of exaggerated thresholds.RESULTS: The mean PTA was 33 dB. Seventy-two percent had a hearing disability of an average of 26% when assessed by the Irish system. Fifty-four percent had a hearing disability of an average of 30% when assessed by the American Medical Association system. Twenty-six percent of subjects had exaggerated thresholds based on CERA. A binaural hearing threshold of &gt;25 dB at 500 Hz had a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 59% for the detection of exaggerated thresholds.CONCLUSION: Exaggerated hearing thresholds are common. A hearing threshold of &gt;25 dB at 500 Hz should be considered an indication for CERA testing."
"12597181","Evaluation of the risk of noise-induced hearing loss among unscreened male industrial workers.","Variability in background risk and distribution of various risk factors for hearing loss may explain some of the diversity in excess risk of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). This paper examines the impact of various risk factors on excess risk estimates of NIHL using data from the 1968-1972 NIOSH Occupational Noise and Hearing Survey (ONHS). Previous analyses of a subset of these data focused on 1172 highly &quot;screened&quot; workers. In the current analysis, an additional 894 white males (609 noise-exposed and 285 controls), who were excluded for various reasons (i.e., nonoccupational noise exposure, otologic or medical conditions affecting hearing, prior occupational noise exposure) have been added 2066) to assess excess risk of noise-induced material impairment in an unscreened population. Data are analyzed by age, duration of exposure, and sound level (8-h TWA) for four different definitions of noise-induced hearing impairment, defined as the binaural pure-tone average (PTA) hearing threshold level greater than 25 dB for the following frequencies: (a) 1-4 kHz (PTA1234), (b) 1-3 kHz (PTA123), (c) 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz (PTA512), and (d) 3, 4, and 6 kHz (PTA346). Results indicate that populations with higher background risks of hearing loss may show lower excess risks attributable to noise relative to highly screened populations. Estimates of lifetime excess risk of hearing impairment were found to be significantly different between screened and unscreened population for noise levels greater than 90 dBA. Predicted age-related risk of material hearing impairment in the ONHS unscreened population was similar to that predicted from Annex B and C of ANSI S3.44 for ages less than 60 years. Results underscore the importance of understanding differential risk patterns for hearing loss and the use of appropriate reference (control) populations when evaluating risk of noise-induced hearing impairment among contemporary industrial populations."
"12592917","Effects of occupational ultrasonic noise exposure on hearing of dental hygienists: a pilot study.","PURPOSE: The purpose of this case-control study was to determine whether long-term ultrasonic noise exposure via the dental office environment is related to dental hygienists' hearing status.METHODS: Registered dental hygienists (N = 698) who live in the Hampton Roads areas of Virginia were mailed a Dental Hygiene Work History Questionnaire to determine who would meet the inclusion criteria and would be willing to participate in the study. Consenting subjects were categorized into one of two groups, according to ultrasonic scaler usage rate, and matched on age. Persons with known hearing loss due to infection, disease, or congenital defect were excluded from the study. The final sample consisted of 20 dental hygienists with a high ultrasonic usage rate and a matched group of 20 dental hygienists who had a low ultrasonic usage rate. Once the groups were formed, a certified audiologist tested subjects' hearing in each ear via the pure-tone audiometer. Audiometric data were analyzed using the analysis of variance for repeated measures procedure to determine if degree of ultrasonic scaler noise exposure in the dental office environment was significantly related to hearing status in these dental hygienists.RESULTS: Results revealed that the right and left ears were not statistically different in the hearing threshold levels, regardless of group status. However, there was a significant difference in the high ultrasonic usage group and the low ultrasonic usage group at the 3000 Hz. No differences were found at the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz.CONCLUSIONS: Based on these outcomes, the ultrasonic scaler is not considered to have a negative effect on the hearing of dental hygienists at 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz, but may be related to hearing loss at 3000 Hz. Ultrasonic noise may in fact be affecting dental hygienists' hearing at 3000 Hz, but loss of hearing observed at the higher frequencies may be attributed to other unidentified factors present in both groups."
"12577807","[Assessment and analysis of the acoustic environment of soldiers exposed to impulse noise].","The aim of the study was to assess the acoustic environment of soldiers attending a one year basic military service. The study material comprised 13 types of weapons used by this group of soldiers. During the target practice, the following parameters were measured separately for the right ear and the left ear: equivalent sound pressure level A (LA eq, Te); maximum sound pressure level A (LA F max) and peak sound pressure level C (LC peak). The measurements covered several single shots or a shot series. In addition, a spectroanalysis in 1/3-octave band frequency of 40-50,000 Hz, was conducted. There were following values of measurements in the direct vicinity of the ears: LA eq, Te fell within the range of 106.2-119.5 dB (mean, 112.2 dB) for the right ear and 104.2 dB-118.4 dB (mean, 113.2 dB) for the left ear; LA F max within the range of 124.5-132.3 dB (mean, 128.3 dB) for the right ear and 116.3-135.1 dB (mean, 128.1 dB) for the left ear; LC pcak within the range of 151.8-156.5 dB (mean, 154.8 dB/155 dB) for the right ear and 151.9-156.2 dB (mean, 155.4 dB) for the left ear. In the noise spectrum, components of audible frequencies predominated, 160-300 Hz (mainly for high caliber weapon); 1600-6300 Hz for the right ear and 2500-4000 Hz for the left peak (small caliber weapons); 6300-16,000 and ultrasonic 25,000-50,000 Hz. No significant differences were found in the measurements of the right ear and the left ear."
"12564513","Temporary threshold shift in military pilots measured using conventional and extended high-frequency audiometry after one flight.","Noise of such a high level that it can result in hearing deterioration is an inherent characteristic of military flying. Susceptibility to hearing impairment was studied using 51 Finnish Air Force military personnel as subjects. The test persons flew missions on a British Aerospace Hawk 51 advanced jet trainer, Boeing F-18 Hornet, Mikoyan &amp; Gurevich MiG-21bis and Saab 35 Draken interceptors, and a Valmet Redigo turboprop liaison aircraft. The duration of noise exposure was one flight mission, which varied from 30 to 60 min. Noise doses and levels were measured using a miniature microphone at the inlet of the ear canal, while a second microphone was located at the level of the subject's shoulder. Hearing thresholds were measured before each flight using conventional (0.125-8 kHz) and extended high-frequency (EHF) (8.20 kHz) audiometry. The measurements were repeated as soon as possible after the flight. The study showed that the pre-flight threshold levels of the subjects were good. Both conventional and EHF audiometry revealed statistically significant temporary threshold shifts (TTS) at several frequencies and with all aircraft types involved. The changes were, however, minor. The risk of noise-induced hearing impairment at the studied exposure levels is, in all probability, rather small. The role of extended high-frequency audiometry would be in research, and it might be performed for flying personnel upon entering service and every fifth year thereafter."
"12553175","Ototoxic effects of occupational exposure to styrene and co-exposure to styrene and noise.","Ototoxicity of styrene and the synergistic action of styrene and noise have been shown in rats. The respective data in humans are scarce and equivocal. This study evaluated the effects of occupational exposure to styrene and combined exposures to styrene and noise on hearing. The study group, comprised of 290-yacht yard and plastic factory workers, was exposed to a mixture of organic solvents, having styrene as its main compound. The reference group, totaling 223 subjects, included (1) white-collar workers, exposed neither to solvents nor noise and (2) metal factory workers, exposed exclusively to noise. All subjects were assessed by means of a detailed questionnaire and underwent otorhinolaryngological and audiometric examinations. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed almost a 4-fold (or 3.9; 95% CI = 2.4-6.2) increase in the odds of developing hearing loss related to styrene exposure. The factors adjusted for were: age, gender, current occupational exposure to noise, and exposure to noise in the past. In cases of the combined exposures to styrene and noise, the odds ratios were two to three times higher than the respective values for styrene-only and noise-only exposed subjects. The mean hearing thresholds--adjusted for age, gender, and exposure to noise--were significantly higher in the solvent-exposed group than in the unexposed reference group at all frequencies tested. A positive linear relationship existed between an averaged working life exposure to styrene concentration and a hearing threshold at the frequencies of 6 and 8 kHz. This study provides the epidemiological evidence that occupational exposure to styrene is related to an increased risk of hearing loss. Combined exposures to noise and styrene seem to be more ototoxic than exposure to noise alone."

There was significant difference of the incidence of presbycusis between urban and rural. The audiometric thresholds chart manifested that the threshold elevated with age increasing especially in high-frequency.CONCLUSION: The etiology of hearing loss of elders was mainly due to presbycusis. The higher incidence of psychotic disorder in urban probably caused a correspondingly higher incidence of presbycusis. So the prevention and cure of some age-induced diseased (e.g. hypertension, arteriosclerosis and diabetes) may be helpful to release and improve presbycusis."

One hundred and seventeen workers were tested in routine pure-tone tested method. The SPVN and ABR were tested within fifty-one workers of all.RESULT: The working noise of Yansan Petrochemical Co. belongs to the broad band and steady noise. The intensity of the working noise were during 85.7-104.0 dB(A) and the main frequency were during 1-8 kHz. About 59 percent workers who exposed to the working noise had hearing loss. The most hearing-loss were in the high frequency. The hearing-loss of speech frequency were slight. Workers who have more six years standing have obviously increased hearing-loss than the workers who have less five years standing. There were significant differences the ABR thresholds and wave-interval between the tested and controlled groups. The SPVN and CP were abnormal in more than 17.4 percent workers with hearing loss.CONCLUSION: The working noise of Yansan Petrochemical Co. belongs to the broad band and steady noise. Working noise can lead to workers' hearing loss of certain degrees who exposed in the noise for a long time. Obvious correlation was not defined between the hearing-loss and the abnormal vestibular response group."
"12516904","Cigarette smoking and hearing loss: lessons from the young adult periodic examinations in Israel (YAPEIS) database.","BACKGROUND: Some studies have indicated a possible link between cigarette smoking and hearing loss.OBJECTIVES: To analyze the association between smoking and hearing loss, other than that induced by noise, and to characterize the type of HL impairment found in smokers.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study in 13,308 men aged 20-68 (median 34.6 years) who underwent a hearing test as part of a routine periodic examination. For each subject, age, smoking status (current, past or non-smokers) and number of cigarettes per day were noted and a hearing test was performed. The test was performed in a sealed, soundproof room by an experienced audiologist and included pure tone audiometry of 250-8,000 Hz. The audiograms were analyzed and subjects were accordingly divided into two groups: those with HL and at least one of the following impairments in at least one ear: sensorineural, conductive or mixed; and those with no hearing loss (control). Audiograms showing HL typical to noise exposure were excluded.RESULTS: The prevalence of any type of HL among subjects &lt; 35 years was 4.5%, compared to 10.5% among those &gt; 35 years (P &lt; 0.0001). A significantly higher incidence of any type of HL was found in current (11.8%) and past smokers (11.7%) than in non-smokers (8.1%) (P &lt; 0.0001). The risk increment of the smoking status for developing HL among subjects under age 35 was 43%, and 17% among those above 35 years. Both mild, flat, sensorineural impairment and conductive impairment were found to be associated particularly with smoking (odds ratio 2.2 and 1.9, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of HL unrelated to noise exposure is higher in smokers than in non-smokers, and in young adults the effect is greater."
"15477283","Predictors of hearing threshold levels and distortion product otoacoustic emissions among noise exposed young adults.","AIM: To examine the relations between noise exposure and other risk factors with hearing function as measured by audiometric thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emissions.METHODS: A total of 456 subjects were studied (393 apprentices in construction trades and 63 graduate students). Hearing and peripheral auditory function were quantified using standard, automated threshold audiometry, tympanometry, and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). The analysis addressed relations of noise exposure history and other risk factors with hearing threshold levels (HTLs) and DPOAEs at the baseline test for the cohort.RESULTS: The cohort had a mean age of 27 (7) years. The construction apprentices reported more noise exposure than students in both their occupational and non-occupational exposure histories. A strong effect of age and years of work in construction was observed at 4, 6, and 8 kHz for both HTLs and DPOAEs. Each year of construction work reported prior to baseline was associated with a 0.7 dB increase in HTL or 0.2 dB decrease DPOAE amplitude. Overall, there was a very similar pattern of effects between the HTLs and DPOAEs.CONCLUSIONS: This analysis shows a relatively good correspondence between the associations of noise exposures and other risk factors with DPOAEs and the associations observed with pure-tone audiometric thresholds in a young adult working population. The results provide further evidence that DPOAEs can be used to assess damage to hearing from a variety of exposures including noise. Clarifying advantages of DPOAEs or HTLs in terms of sensitivity to early manifestations of noise insults, or their utility in predicting future loss in hearing will require longitudinal follow up."
"15457813","A longitudinal study of changes in evoked otoacoustic emissions and pure-tone thresholds as measured in a hearing conservation program.","Non-linear transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) at 74dB pSPL, distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) at 65/45dB SPL and pure-tone audiometry were used to detect noise-induced, inner car changes in a longitudinal study. Repeated-measures ANOVAs were made on the Noise (n=69) and Quiet (n=42) groups. The Noise group's hearing thresholds increased by 1.2 dB and DPOAE amplitude decreased by -0.9 dB. For both groups, TEOAE amplitude decreased by approximately -0.6 dB. Eight of 12 ears with permanent threshold shift (PTS) and 10 of 13 ears with temporary threshold shift (TTS) showed TEOAE decrements or low baseline TEOAE amplitudes. Fewer TTS and PTS ears also showed DPOAE decrements, and there was never a DPOAE decrement without a corresponding TEOAE decrement or low TEOAE baseline. Some TTS ears showed permanent emission decrements. Although otoacoustic emissions show promise in detecting noise-induced inner ear changes, it is premature to use them in hearing conservation programs."

"15285856","Noise exposure in orthopaedic practice: potential health risk.","Noise exposure is one of the major causes of permanent hearing loss in society. Exposure of health service staff to intense levels of noise in the workplace is a potential risk for the development of temporary and permanent hearing loss. In this prospective study, 18 members of the orthopaedic staff underwent hearing assessment by pure tone audiometry and speech discrimination prior to noise exposure at the workplace and immediately following cessation of work. The number of hours of exposure and noise levels in the workplace was also analysed. Only minimal temporary sensorineural threshold shifts were detected post-noise exposure. There was no change in speech discrimination scores and no individuals complained of tinnitus. The number of hours of exposure ranged from 1.5 to 8.5 hours (mean 5.2 hours). Recorded sound levels for instruments ranged from 119.6 dB at source to 73.1 decibels at 3 metres. Although high sound levels are recorded in the orthopaedic operating theatre, the intermittent nature exposure to the intense noise may protect staff against hearing loss, speech discrimination difficulties and tinnitus."

The causes leading to AAT, causative weapons and mode and level of hearing protection were analysed to find out why so many AATs still occur in the FDF. The material consisted of 119 patients of the total 163 AAT patients treated at the Central Military Hospital during the year 2000. In 87.5% of cases, the AATs occurred in unprotected ears. The most common causative weapon was the assault rifle. Most of the AATs occurred during combat training in the field. Immediately after the AAT. 46.7% of conscripts had hearing impairment and 94.2% tinnitus. Hearing loss, tinnitus or both were experienced by 45% of conscripts at the last follow-up. Careful planning of training exercises could probably prevent some but not all AATs."
"15198380","The effects of 'supra-physiological' vitamin B12 administration on temporary threshold shift.","The aim of this study was to evaluate, in 20 young volunteer subjects, the effects of supra-physiological vitamin B12 administration on noise-induced temporary threshold shift (TTS). All subjects had hearing thresholds within 15 dBHL and type A tympanograms. The subjects were randomly assigned to two different groups. Experimental group subjects received cyanocobalamin, 1 mg daily for 7 days, and 5 mg on the eighth day. Control group subjects received a placebo injection daily for 8 days. The vitamin B12 concentration, hearing thresholds and TTS2 (10 min of exposure, narrowband noise centred at 3 kHz, bandwidth of 775 Hz, 112 dBSPL) were measured before and 8 days after treatment. At the end of treatment, the serum vitamin B12 concentration was significantly increased in the experimental group. After 8 days of treatment, the control group showed the same hearing thresholds and TTS2 degrees. Statistical analysis showed that TTS2 decreased significantly at 3 and 4kHz when cobalamin was used to increase the serum concentration of vitamin B12 to &gt; 2350 pg/ml. In addition, a protective effect at 3 kHz in the experimental group was evident when compared with the placebo group. These results suggest that elevated plasma cyanocobalamin levels may reduce the risk of hearing dysfunction resulting from noise exposure in healthy, young subjects."
"15115600","Pathophysiological changes of the central auditory pathway after blunt trauma of the head.","It is the aim of the present paper to correlate clinical symptoms of auditory dysfunction (tinnitus, hyperacusis, hearing loss) one year on average after a blunt trauma of the head with objective audiological test results (otoacoustic emission and auditory brainstem response testing, impedance audiometry) and to compare these findings to controls without history of head trauma. Thirty-one patients (24-56 years) were included. They were largely female (n = 26). The clinical and otolaryngological examination (including otoscopy) of all patients revealed no pathological abnormalities. Pure-tone audiograms were normal with one exception (pre-existing noise-induced hearing loss) as well as tympanograms. The main auditory symptoms were tinnitus (n = 9), hyperacusis (n = 2) and a reported transient hearing loss immediately after the trauma (n = 16) (which had improved at the time of examination). The results of testing the central auditory pathway showed that the transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions (otoemissions) revealed statistically significant differences between amplitude differences of all patients as well as patients with tinnitus and controls in the linear, but not in the non-linear stimulation mode. A complete loss of stapedial reflex responses was found in 12 of the patients and a partial (irregular) loss (in at least more than two frequencies) in four additional patients. Auditory brainstem responses (ABR) were normal in all patients, but 76% had lowered loudness discomfort levels (LDL). Blunt trauma of the head can lead to auditory dyfunction, probably as a result of diffuse axonal injury of the central auditory pathway. An initial sensorineural hearing loss after the trauma (as a result of the inner ear fluid concussion) was transiently reported only. Auditory symptoms play a minor role in the so-called &quot;postconcussive syndrome,&quot; but should be considered and evaluated fully."

"15101286","Epidemiology of occupational noise-induced hearing loss (ONIHL) in Poland.","Noise-induced hearing loss is a major health risk worldwide. In Europe about 35 million people are exposed to detrimental noise levels (&gt; 85 dB-A) in industrial plants, and occupational deafness is a leading occupational compensible disease in the all countries; it is an insidious slow process that develops over a period of approximately 10 to 20 years. Accordingly to the latest estimations, more than 650,000 workers (of a total 5 million employed in industry) are put at risk in Poland. Despite progress in engineering approaches for reducing noise in the work environment and in improving hearing conservation programs (both the technical and medical) the ONIHL still remains a common and costly disability. The aim of this study is presentation of the most recent data on the incidence of ONIHL in Poland in the years 1992-2002 considered to be a base for implementing the effective prophylactic activities. The analysed data were derived from the central state register which collects all cases of occupational diseases recognized in the country. The highest incidence was found in such key industrial branches as coal mining, iron and steel, metallurgical and transport equipment; majority of cases were observed in southern and western provinces, mainly in the Silesian district, known from the significant concentration of noisy enterprises. The most affected were those workers aged 50-59 years and exposed to noise for over 20 years. More than 30 new cases of ONIHL were identified in the years 1992-1998 annually per 100,000 employees, and with beginning 1999 the rate was significantly decreased to 10 cases in 2002. One may presume that it results from the set up of national program of hearing preservation introduced in 1999 with obligatory pre-employment and follow-up pure-tone audiometry, as well as with hearing screening by means of the otoacoustic emissions."
"15041049","Comparative analysis of serum homocysteine, folic acid and Vitamin B12 levels in patients with noise-induced hearing loss.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to determine the levels of homocysteine, folic acid, and Vitamin B12 in subjects with noise-induced hearing loss. Furthermore, possible links between these parameters and noise-induced hearing loss were aimed to be evaluated.METHODS: In the present study, blood samples were obtained from all subjects after overnight fasting for biochemical analysis. We examined the levels of homocysteine, Vitamin B12 and folic acid levels in subjects with noise-induced hearing loss. Twenty-eight male patients with noise-induced hearing loss (mean age 37 +/- 5 year) were included in the study group whereas the control group was composed of 32 healthy male volunteers (mean age 36 +/- 4 year).RESULTS: It was found that homocysteine levels of subjects with noise-induced hearing loss as significantly high compared to healthy controls (P &lt; 0.05). On the other hand, Vitamin B12 and folic acid levels of patients with noise-induced hearing loss were determined to be significantly low compared to the controls (P &lt; 0.05 and &lt; 0.01, respectively).CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that there might be a link between increased homocysteine levels and noise-induced hearing loss. Since increased homocysteine levels cause elevated levels of free radicals in addition to its atherogenic and thrombogenic effects. Further experimental studies are needed to decipher how this relationship is linked."
"15035560","Modelling the risk of noise-induced hearing loss among military pilots.","Noise is a significant risk factor in aviation, especially in military aviation. Even though our earlier studies have shown that the risk of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) among military pilots is small and the monitoring of their hearing is effective, we still need to develop methods of assessing the risk of NIHL more effectively at both the general and individual levels. In addition, many other risk factors are considered to contribute to the development of hearing impairment. The novel NoiseScan data management system enables assessment of the risk of developing hearing impairment on the basis of known risk factors. This study investigates the risk of hearing impairment among Finnish Air Force pilots using reasonably accurate noise exposure data and other risk factors for hearing impairment. This risk is also compared with that of industrial workers, whose risk followed the ISO 1999 prediction. Hearing among Finnish military pilots turned out to be better than predicted by the ISO 1999 model. The industrial workers had a larger number of risk factors than the pilots. Owing to the small number of risk factors, the hearing of pilots corresponds to approximately the 80th percentile, being 9-13 dB better than the 50th percentile obtained with the industrial population."
"14979949","Noise induced hearing loss in dance music disc jockeys and an examination of sound levels in nightclubs.","Noise exposure, hearing loss and associated otological symptoms have been studied in a group of 23 disc jockeys using a questionnaire and pure tone audiometry. The level of noise exposure in the venues where they work has also been studied using Ametek Mk-3 audio dosimeters. Three members of the study group showed clear evidence of noise-induced hearing loss on audiometry, 70 per cent reported temporary threshold shift after sessions and 74 per cent reported tinnitus. Sound levels of up to 108 dB(A) were recorded in the nightclubs. The average level for a typical session was 96 dB(A) which is above the level at which the provision of ear protection is mandatory for employers in industry. It can be concluded that DJs are at substantial risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss and noise exposure in nightclubs frequently exceeds safe levels."
"14763230","Effects of discotheque music on audiometric results and central acoustic evoked neuromagnetic responses.","Audiograms and auditory evoked magnetic fields (AEFs) were observed in young male and female adults at different ages before and after being exposed to discotheque music for 4 hours. Sound pressure levels (SPLs) ranged from 95 dB (SPL) up to 130 dB (SPL). After exposure, subjects had temporary threshold shifts up to 20-25 dB, which almost disappeared after 2 hours. The majority of the subjects suffered from tinnitus that lasted approximately as long as the temporary threshold shift. Correspondingly, a transient delay and prolongation of the main component of the acoustically evoked magnetic field (AEF) negative wave, occurring 100 msec after stimulus (N100 m), was seen after this exposure; other components of the AEF (positive wave, occurring 50, 160, and 200 msec after stimulus [P50 m, P160 m, and P200 m, respectively]) occurred less often as compared to nonexposed controls. Because effects of vigilance on the AEF could be excluded, these changes can be related to the loud music, indicating an influence of noise on central auditory processing. The transient tinnitus could be caused by acoustic microinjuries (hidden acoustic predamage) of outer hair cells, leading to the persistent hearing threshold shifts from which many young adults aged 20-24 years are suffering. Occurrence of tinnitus closely coincides with the changes in hearing threshold and AEF, thus, a limitation of loudness in discotheques is needed to prevent this kind of hearing hazard."
"16377998","Estimating noise-induced permanent threshold shift from audiometric shape: the ISO-1999 model.","OBJECTIVE: To describe the relation between audiometric shape and noise-induced permanent threshold shift averaged across the speech frequencies (N5123).DESIGN: Using an international standard (ISO-1999), 270 audiograms were created, representing both sexes and a variety of ages, exposure levels, and percentiles. Bulge depth (BD) was defined as the difference between pure-tone average for 2, 3, and 4 kHz and PTA for 1 and 6 kHz.RESULTS: N5123 was well-predicted by quadratic functions of BD, which accounted for 72 to 95% of the variance in N5123.CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of N5123, based on BD, can be helpful in medical-legal diagnosis and allocation of hearing loss."
"16112827","Distortion-product otoacoustic emission spectra and high-resolution audiometry in noise-induced hearing loss.","Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) elicited by 60dB SPL pure tones at f1 and f2 were collected at 2f1-f2, in 1/10th octave steps, in a sample of 36 ears from 27 patients with noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). They were analyzed in the frequency domain against the outcome of high-resolution pure-tone audiometry, performed with the help of a Békésy sweep-frequency automatic audiometer. The characteristics of DPOAE level plots as a function of frequency (the so-called DP-grams), relative to the DPOAE levels of a control age-matched group, were compared to their alleged counterparts on the audiograms, i.e., the lower and upper frequency boundaries of the interval with hearing loss. Ears with NIHL split into two subgroups, one (n = 25) with a notch in the DP-gram such that its lower boundary matched the lower limit of the audiometric notch (linear regression with a slope of 0.91, r(2) = 0.644, p &lt; 0.001). Likewise, when it existed, its upper boundary matched its upper counterpart on the audiogram (linear regression with a slope of 0.96, r(2) = 0.89, p &lt; 0.001). In this respect, DP-grams performed better than transient-evoked OAE spectra, which exhibited poor correlations with audiogram patterns. The second subgroup (n = 11) exhibited normal DPOAEs at all frequencies despite audiometric losses similar to those of the first subgroup. In all cases, DPOAE levels were poor predictors of the degree of hearing losses. It is hypothesized that NIHL in the second subgroup involves inner hair cells or auditory neurons, instead of outer hair cells in the first subgroup. Provided NIHL affected outer hair cells, DP-grams provided a comparatively accurate predictor of the spectral extent of hearing loss."
"16111421","Extended high-frequency audiometry in patients with acoustic trauma.","OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine extended high-frequency (EHF) hearing in patients with acoustic trauma.DESIGN: A prospective, case-control study in a group of soldiers with acoustic trauma caused by shooting practice during basic training.SETTING: Tertiary referral centre.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 39 young soldiers hospitalized for hearing loss and tinnitus following exposure to weapon impulse noise were studied. Conventional audiometry in the frequency range 0.25-8 kHz and EHF audiometry in the frequency range 9-20 kHz were performed, both on admittance and before discharge. Thirty healthy recruits of similar age and sex were used as controls.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pure-tone threshold changes documented by conventional and EHF audiometry.RESULTS: The most significant differences in pure-tone thresholds on initial testing were found in the frequency range 0.25-11.2 kHz, and especially in the 4-8 kHz region. Reduction in thresholds across most frequencies was observed after treatment, although recovery was partial in most cases.CONCLUSIONS: The EHF audiometry adds no significant additional information to conventional pure-tone audiometry in assessing and monitoring noise-induced hearing loss."
"16100934","Combined effects of noise and mixed solvents exposure on the hearing function among workers in the aviation industry.","This study aims to evaluate the effect of occupational exposure to noise and organic solvents on hearing loss in the aviation industry. The study population comprised 542 male workers, who worked in avionics jobs in Kimhae, Korea, who kept records of work environment evaluations and medical examinations. The Cumulative Exposure Index (CEI) was constructed to assess the lifetime cumulative exposure of the workers, and pure tone audiometry (PTA) data of the workers from their biannual medical surveillance was used to assess hearing loss. The prevalence of hearing loss found in the group exposed to noise and mixed solvents simultaneously (54.9%) was higher than those in the other groups (6.0% in the unexposed, 17.1% in the noise-only, and 27.8 % in the exposed to only a solvents mixture). The relative risks, adjusted for age, were estimated to be 4.3 (95 % CI 1.7-10.8) for the noise-only group, 8.1 (95% CI 2.0-32.5) for the noise and solvents group, and 2.6 (95 % CI 0.6-10.3) for the solvents-mixture group. These suggest that chronic exposure to mixed solvents had a toxic effect on the auditory system. This raises the issue of whether hearing conservation regulations should be applied to all workers exposed to solvents."
"16018495","Pure tone audiograms and possible aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss in belugas (Delphinapterus leucas).","A behavioral response paradigm was used to measure pure-tone hearing sensitivities in two belugas (Delphinapterus leucas). Tests were conducted over a 20-month period at the Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium, in Tacoma, WA. Subjects were two males, aged 8-10 and 9-11 during the course of the study. Subjects were born in an oceanarium and had been housed together for all of their lives. Hearing thresholds were measured using a modified up/down staircase procedure and acoustic response paradigm where subjects were trained to produce audible responses to test tones and to remain quiet otherwise. Test frequencies ranged from approximately 2 to 130 kHz. Best sensitivities ranged from approximately 40 to 50 dB re 1 microPa at 50-80 kHz and 30-35 kHz for the two subjects. Although both subjects possessed traditional &quot;U-shaped&quot; mammalian audiograms, one subject exhibited significant high-frequency hearing loss above 37 kHz compared to previously published data for belugas. Hearing loss in this subject was estimated to approach 90 dB for frequencies above 50 kHz. Similar ages, ancestry, and environmental conditions between subjects, but a history of ototoxic drug administration in only one subject, suggest that the observed hearing loss was a result of the aminoglycoside antibiotic amikacin."
"15937413","Hearing levels of firefighters: risk of occupational noise-induced hearing loss assessed by cross-sectional and longitudinal data.","OBJECTIVE: It is well known that firefighters face serious risk to their health and safety in the performance of their duties. To determine whether individuals who work as firefighters sustain occupational noise-induced hearing losses, we evaluated results of hearing tests completed by firefighters and compared them with age-matched, non-occupationally exposed groups of individuals.DESIGN: The results of annual audiometric testing and a related questionnaire collected as part of a company-wide hearing conservation program were obtained from two large urban fire departments. The records from 12,609 tests conducted over an 11-year period were evaluated. Hearing levels obtained from the tests were compared with age-matched control populations from an American national standard, and a longitudinal study comparing the rate of hearing loss to that expected due to presbycusis alone was conducted.RESULTS: Comparisons of the data to the national standard indicated that firefighters do not exhibit excessive loss of hearing compared with age-matched, non-occupationally exposed control subjects. The longitudinal study that examined the regression of firefighters' hearing with age compared with the expected presbycasic regression function indicated that the hearing of firefighters in the study declined over the 7-year period at a rate that was less than that expected due to age alone.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this large-scale, cross-sectional, and longitudinal study indicate that firefighters are not at risk for occupational noise-induced hearing loss, even though they work nonstandard shifts and are occasionally exposed to high levels of noise. The results are consistent with the findings but not the conclusions of several other studies of firefighters' hearing."
"15913156","Is there a relevant effect of noise and smoking on hearing? A population-based aging study.","The objectives of the present study were to evaluate both the respective and combined effects of occupational noise exposure and smoking on hearing, taking age into consideration. The evaluation was conducted using 1478 subjects without a history of ear disease out of a population-based sample of 2267 adults, aged 40 79 years. Pure-tone audiometry and a questionnaire were administered. A deleterious effect of noise exposure on hearing was significantly observed in both genders at many frequencies after adjustment for age, income, and education. The smoking habit alone significantly affected hearing deterioration at 4000 Hz in noise-unexposed males. The combined effect of noise and smoking was not interactive but additive. A dose-response effect of smoking on hearing loss was observed in middle-aged males without noise exposure. Smoking and noise exposure were associated with hearing loss respectively.. This result is noteworthy for the preservation of good hearing especially at the beginning of aging."
"15913155","Recreational noise exposure and its effects on the hearing of adolescents. Part II: development of hearing disorders.","Part II, continuation of a previous paper, describes the significant hearing threshold shift found during the third year of the long-term study, which continued to be present in the fourth year, in a number of adolescents classified as Subgroup 2, who showed a higher mean HTL in the middle and especially in the high frequency ranges than the rest of the studied adolescents, classified as Subgroup 1. In both subgroups, the subjects showed high participation in recreational activities; nevertheless, the adolescents in Subgroup 2 showed higher participation in some of them in the last year of the study. From the beginning of the study, the mean HTL of the adolescents in Subgroup 2 was higher than the mean HTL of the adolescents in Subgroup 1. The exposure to high sound levels during leisure activities can be a cause of permanent hearing damage among young people with 'tender ears'."
"15913154","Recreational noise exposure and its effects on the hearing of adolescents. Part I: an interdisciplinary long-term study.","This interdisciplinary long-term study examined the effects of recreational noise exposure on the hearing of adolescents. Boys and girls (aged 14-17 years) were examined during a four-year period. Audiological, psychosocial, and sound measurements were performed yearly to determine the hearing threshold level (HTL) of participants in the 250-16000 Hz range, their participation in recreational activities, and the sound levels at discos and through personal music player use. A tendency of the mean HTL to increase in both genders during the study was observed, especially at 14000 Hz and 16000 Hz. Boys had a higher mean HTL than girls. The participation in musical activities increased yearly, 'attendance at discos' being the favourite musical activity for both groups. In general, boys were more exposed to high sound levels than girls. The equivalent sound levels in discos ranged between 104.3 and 112.4 dBA, and between 75 and 105 dBA from personal music players."
"21783525","Exacerbation of noise-induced hearing loss by co-exposure to workplace chemicals.","BACKGROUND: : Numerous organic solvents applied in industry, like toluene, styrene, xylene and n-hexane have been demonstrated to impair hearing in animals. However, the effects of exposure to a given organic solvent and the interaction of noise and solvents on hearing in humans are still not fully recognized.STUDY DESIGN: : The study was aimed to assess the effects of occupational exposure to solvents alone or in combination with noise on hearing in 1117 employees of yacht, ship, plastic, shoe, and paint and lacquer industry. These persons were exposed either to the mixture of organic solvents with xylene as the main component, or predominantly to styrene, or to the mixture of n-hexane and toluene. Detailed questionnaire data and pure-tone audiometry were compared with data of the reference group that included white collar workers, exposed neither to solvents nor noise and metal factory workers exposed to noise only. In all statistics, the confounding factors were recognized as gender, age, exposure to noise, and other variables occurring at a different rate in study and reference group.RESULTS: : Odds ratio (OR) of hearing loss related with the particular exposure to chemicals was 2.4 (95%CI 1.59-3.74) in case of solvent mixture, 3.9 (95%CI 2.4-6.2) in case of styrene and 5.3 (95%CI 2.6-10.9) in case of n-hexane and toluene exposure. The odds of developing hearing loss substantially increased in the case of combined exposure to organic solvents and noise as compared to isolated exposure to each of these hazards. The highest OR (over 20-fold) was demonstrated in subgroups of subjects exposed simultaneously to noise and two ototoxic solvents (i.e. styrene and toluene or n-hexane and toluene). The mean hearing thresholds were significantly higher in the solvent-exposed groups than in the reference group. The differences in thresholds were observed at high frequencies in the solvent mixture- and n-hexane + toluene-exposed groups and at all frequencies in the styrene-exposed group. A positive linear relationship existed between exposure to solvents and hearing thresholds at high frequencies.CONCLUSIONS: : The results of the study provide the epidemiological evidence that exposure to organic solvents in humans is associated with an increased risk of hearing loss. The simultaneous exposure to organic solvents and noise seems to enhance the hearing deficit if compared with isolated exposures."
"15837852","Prospective noise induced changes to hearing among construction industry apprentices.","AIMS: To characterise the development of noise induced damage to hearing.METHODS: Hearing and noise exposure were prospectively monitored among a cohort of newly enrolled construction industry apprentices and a comparison group of graduate students, using standard pure tone audiometry and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). A total of 328 subjects (632 ears) were monitored annually an average of 3.4 times. In parallel to these measures, noise exposure and hearing protection device (HPD) use were extensively monitored during construction work tasks. Recreational/non-occupational exposures also were queried and monitored in subgroups of subjects. Trade specific mean exposure L(eq) levels, with and without accounting for the variable use of hearing protection in each trade, were calculated and used to group subjects by trade specific exposure level. Mixed effects models were used to estimate the change in hearing outcomes over time for each exposure group.RESULTS: Small but significant exposure related changes in DPOAEs over time were observed, especially at 4 kHz with stimulus levels (L1) between 50 and 75 dB, with less clear but similar patterns observed at 3 kHz. After controlling for covariates, the high exposure group had annual changes in 4 kHz emissions of about 0.5 dB per year. Pure tone audiometric thresholds displayed only slight trends towards increased threshold levels with increasing exposure groups. Some unexpected results were observed, including an apparent increase in DPOAEs among controls over time, and improvement in behavioural thresholds among controls at 6 kHz only.CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that construction apprentices in their first three years of work, with average noise exposures under 90 dBA, have measurable losses of hearing function. Despite numerous challenges in using DPOAEs for hearing surveillance in an industrial setting, they appear somewhat more sensitive to these early changes than is evident with standard pure tone audiometry."
"15699090","Joint effects of smoking, noise exposure and age on hearing loss.","BACKGROUND: Smoking has been shown to have adverse effects on hearing, but it's unclear whether smoking interacts with known causes of hearing loss such as noise exposure and ageing.AIMS: To examine the hypothesis that smoking, noise and age jointly affect hearing acuity.METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out in 535 male adult workers of a metal processing factory. Pure-tone audiometric tests were utilized to assess hearing loss. Noise exposure assessment was based on a job exposure matrix constructed with industrial hygienist scoring and job titles. Each participant answered questionnaires about socio-demographic, life-style, occupational and health-related data. Analysis of the possible underlying biological model was undertaken assessing departures from additivity using measures of the size of the interaction present.RESULTS: Age and occupational noise exposures were, separately, positively associated with hearing loss. For all the factors combined the estimated effect on hearing loss was higher than the sum of the effects from each isolated variable, especially for smoking and noise among those 20-40 years of age, and for smoking and age among those non-exposed to occupational noise.CONCLUSIONS: The synergistic effect of smoking, noise exposure and age on hearing loss, found in this study, is consistent with the biological interaction. Furthermore, it is possible that distinct ototoxic substances in the chemical composition of mainstream smoke may synergistically affect hearing when in combination with noise exposure, which needs to be examined in future studies."
"15692300","Longitudinal study of pure-tone thresholds in older persons.","OBJECTIVE: Pure-tone thresholds for conventional and extended high frequencies were analyzed for 188 older adult human subjects (91 females, 97 males). The objectives were to study longitudinal changes in thresholds as well as the effects of initial threshold levels, age, gender, and noise history on these longitudinal changes.DESIGN: At the time of entry into the study, subjects' ages ranged from 60 to 81 years, with a mean age of 68 years. Subjects had between 2 and 21 visits (mean = 9.81 visits) over a period of 3 to 11.5 years (mean = 6.40 years). Conventional pure-tone thresholds at 0.25 to 8 kHz were measured during most visits. Extended high-frequency (EHF) thresholds at 9 to 18 kHz were measured every 2 to 3 years. The slope of a linear regression was used to estimate the rate of change in pure-tone thresholds at 0.25 to 18 kHz for each ear. A questionnaire was used to identify those subjects with a positive noise history.RESULTS: The average rate of change in thresholds was 0.7 dB per year at 0.25 kHz, increasing gradually to 1.2 dB per year at 8 kHz and 1.23 dB per year at 12 kHz. The rate of change for thresholds increased significantly with age, at 0.25 to 3, 10, and 11 kHz for females and at 6 kHz for males. After adjusting for age, females had a significantly slower rate of change at 1 kHz but a significantly faster rate of change at 6 to 12 kHz than males. For 0.25 and 1 kHz, subjects with more hearing loss at higher frequencies had a faster rate of change at these frequencies, whereas for 6 and 8 kHz, subjects with more hearing loss at mid and high frequencies had a slower rate of change at these frequencies. The rates of threshold change for subjects with a positive noise history were not statistically different from those with a negative noise history.CONCLUSIONS: On average, hearing threshold increased approximately 1 dB per year for subjects age 60 and over. Age, gender, and initial threshold levels can affect the rate of change in thresholds. Older female subjects (&gt; or =70 years) had faster rate of change at 0.25 to 3, 10, and 11 kHz than younger female subjects (60 to 69 years). Older male subjects had faster rate of change at 6 kHz than younger male subjects. Females had a slower rate of change at 1 kHz and a faster rate of change at 6 to 12 kHz than males. Subjects with higher initial thresholds at low and mid frequencies tended to have faster rate of threshold change at 0.25 to 2 kHz in the following years. Subjects with higher initial thresholds at mid and higher frequencies tended to have slower rate of change at 6 to 8 kHz in the following years. Noise history did not have a significant effect on the rate of threshold changes."

A preliminary study].","Smoking and occupational exposure to noise are factors with independent predisposition to sensorineural hearing loss. This is a sinergistic and additive effect.

"17147841","Temporary threshold shift due to recreational firearm use.","OBJECTIVE: To assess whether a temporary threshold shift occurred after recreational firearm use.DESIGN: An observational study of 25 subjects using ear protection in an indoor rifle range. Hearing was evaluated before and after shooting five rounds with a 0.22 calibre rifle over 10 minutes. A threshold shift of 5 dB was found to be statistically significant, while a shift of 10 dB was clinically significant.RESULTS: Twenty-four candidates had a statistically significant threshold shift, while 12 had a clinically significant threshold shift. Two subjects with previous industrial noise exposure had threshold shifts at more frequencies than other subjects. There was no significant preference for either ear. One subject showed no changes.CONCLUSION: This small study sheds some light on impulse noise behaviour in an indoor shooting range, but no definite conclusions can be drawn. The side of shooting did not influence threshold changes in either ear."
"17139737","Modeling distortion product otoacoustic emission input/output functions using segmented regression.","Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) are low-level acoustic signals, the detection of which involves extraction from a background of noise. Boege and Janssen [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 111, 1810-1818 (2002)] described a method for modeling the presence and growth of these responses. While improving growth function parameter estimation, this technique excludes a significant fraction of the data (especially low-level responses), and relies on ad hoc model fit acceptance criteria. The statistical difficulties associated with these limitations are described, and a weighted segmented linear regression model that avoids them is proposed. A simple test is presented for the presence of DPOAE growth. This technique is compared to that of Boege and Janssen in a dataset of 9 556 input/output (I/O) functions collected over 4 years on 866 ears from 379 construction apprentices and 63 age-matched controls. Comparisons are made on the entire dataset and within audiometric hearing loss categories. Segmented regression avoids the statistical pitfalls of the previous method, allows estimation of the threshold and slope of auditory response on a far greater number of I/O functions, and improves estimation of these parameters in this dataset. The potential for this method to yield more sensitive metrics of hearing function and compromise is discussed."
"17086083","Audiogram notches in noise-exposed workers.","OBJECTIVES: Diagnostic criteria for noise-induced hearing loss include the audiometric notch, yet no standardized definition exists. This study tested whether objective notch metrics could match the clinical judgments of an expert panel.DESIGN: A panel of occupational physicians, otolaryngologists, and audiologists reviewed audiograms of noise-exposed workers. In a two-sample process, the panel judged whether a notch was present and whether hearing loss had progressed in a notch pattern. Quantitative notch metrics were compared against expert decisions.RESULTS: At least five of six experts agreed about notch identification in 71 and 72% of the cases in the two samples, and agreement about notch progression was 61 and 67%. Notch depth and professional specialty appeared to affect notch judgments. Despite this variability, a notch metric showed excellent agreement with expert notch consensus in each sample (94.7 and 96.6%; kappa = 0.88 and 0.92).CONCLUSIONS: Audiogram notch metrics can agree with expert clinical consensus and assist in the surveillance of noise-exposed workers."
"17050312","Assessment of central auditory processing in a group of workers exposed to solvents.","CONCLUSION: Despite having normal hearing thresholds and speech recognition thresholds, results for central auditory tests were abnormal in a group of workers exposed to solvents. Workers exposed to solvents may have difficulties in everyday listening situations that are not related to a decrement in hearing thresholds. A central auditory processing disorder may underlie these difficulties.OBJECTIVE: To study central auditory processing abilities in a group of workers occupationally exposed to a mix of organic solvents.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten workers exposed to a mix of organic solvents and 10 matched non-exposed workers were studied. The test battery comprised pure-tone audiometry, tympanometry, acoustic reflex measurement, acoustic reflex decay, dichotic digit, pitch pattern sequence, masking level difference, filtered speech, random gap detection and hearing-in-noise tests.RESULTS: All the workers presented normal hearing thresholds and no signs of middle ear abnormalities. Workers exposed to solvents had lower results in comparison with the control group and previously reported normative data, in the majority of the tests."
"17009596","Association of hsp70 polymorphisms with risk of noise-induced hearing loss in Chinese automobile workers.","Severe noise exposure can induce heat shock proteins (Hsps), and exposure to moderate noise has been reported to confer protection against noise-induced damage to hearing. Whether there is any association of genetic variation in both constitutive and inducible hsp70 genes with noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is presently unknown. Using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism, we genotyped 3 polymorphisms (+190A/ B, +1267A/B, and +2437A/B) in the hsp70-1 (rs1043618), hsp70-2 (rs1061581), and hsp70-hom (rs2227956) genes, respectively, and investigated the associations of these polymorphisms with risk of developing NIHL in 194 automobile workers working in a similar noise environment as evaluated by audiological assessment. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the associations with the risk genotypes, and Whap software was used to analyze their haplotypes. Our results showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the genotype and allele distributions of hsp70-1, hsp70-2, and hsp70-hom between the NIHL group and the normal group (P &gt; 0.05) with and without adjustment for age, sex, smoking, history of explosive noise exposure, and cumulative noise exposure. However, haplotype analysis revealed that the Hap5 (ie, haplotype +190A/+1267B/+2437A) and Hap6 (ie, haplotype +190A/+1267B/+2437B) were significantly more frequent in the NIHL group than in the normal group (20/9, P = 0.022, and 7/0, P = 0.005, respectively). Compared with Hap1 (ie, +190A/+1267A/+2437A), Hap5 was associated with a nearly 3-fold increased risk of NIHL (adjusted odds ratio, 2.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-6.27). Seven of the NIHL patients had Hap6, but none of the controls had this haplotype. Our results suggest that some haplotypes of the hsp70 genes may be associated with a higher susceptibility to NIHL."
"16959884","Progestin negatively affects hearing in aged women.","Female hormone influences on auditory system aging are not completely understood. Because of widespread clinical use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), it is critical to understand HRT effects on sensory systems. The present study retrospectively analyzed and compared hearing abilities among 124 postmenopausal women taking HRT, treated with estrogen and progestin (E+P; n = 32), estrogen alone (E; n = 30), and a third [non-hormone replacement therapy (NHRT; n = 62)] control group. Subjects were 60-86 years old and were matched for age and health status. All had relatively healthy medical histories and no significant noise exposure, middle-ear problems, or major surgeries. Hearing tests included pure-tone audiometry, tympanometry, distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), transient otoacoustic emissions, and the hearing-in-noise test (HINT). The HINT tests for speech perception in background noise, the major complaint of hearing-impaired persons. Pure-tone thresholds in both ears were elevated (poorer) for the E+P relative to the E and control groups. For DPOAEs, the E+P group presented with lower (worse) levels than the E and control groups, with significant differences for both ears. For the HINT results, the E+P group had poorer speech perception than the E and control groups across all background noise speaker locations and in quiet. These findings suggest that the presence of P as a component of HRT results in poorer hearing abilities in aged women taking HRT, affecting both the peripheral (ear) and central (brain) auditory systems, and it interferes with the perception of speech in background noise."

There was no screening by history or otoscopy; all audiograms were included. 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for the engineers' median thresholds for each ear, for the better ear (defined two ways), and for the binaural average. For Annex B, where 95% CIs are also available, it was possible to calculate z scores for the differences between Annex B and the engineers' better ears. Bulge depth, an audiometric shape statistic, measured curvature between 1 and 6 kHz.RESULTS: Engineers' better-ear median thresholds were worse than those in Annex A but (except at 1 kHz) were as good as or better than those in Annexes B and C, which are more appropriate for comparison to an unscreened noise-exposed group like the engineers. Average bulge depth for the engineers was similar to that of the Annex B standard (no added occupational noise) and was much less than that of audiograms created by using the standard with added occupational noise between 90 and 100 dBA.CONCLUSIONS: Audiograms from groups that have been selected for a particular exposure, but, without regard to severity, can appropriately be compared with population standards, if certain pitfalls are avoided. For unscreened study groups with large age-sex subgroups, a simple method to assess statistical significance, taking into consideration uncertainties in both the study group and the comparison standard, is the calculation of z scores for the proportion of better-ear thresholds above the Annex B median. A less powerful method combines small age-sex subgroups after age correction. Small threshold differences, even if statistically significant, may not be due to genuine differences in hearing sensitivity between study group and standard. Audiometric shape analysis offers an independent dimension of comparison between the study group and audiograms predicted from the ANSI S3.44 standard, with and without occupational noise exposure. Important pitfalls in comparison to population standards include nonrandom selection of study groups, inappropriate choice of population standard, use of the right and left ear thresholds instead of the better-ear threshold for comparison to Annex B, and comparing means with medians. The thresholds of the engineers in this study were similar to published standards for an unscreened population."
"16886774","[Prevalence and characterization of hearing loss in workers exposed to industrial noise of the turbogenerated electric plant of a petrochemical industry].","The purpose of the present study was to assess the impact of occupational exposure to noise and its relationship with other factors that can induce hearing loss in the electric plant workers of a petrochemical industry of the west of Venezuela. A cross-sectional study was conducted that included sonometry tests, carried out according to the established methodology by COVENIN rules, and the occupational medical evaluation and liminal tonal audiometrics test in 75 workers. The equivalent noise levels (Leq) was quantified in different workplaces. It was found out that most of the workers are exposed to high noise levels [&gt;85 dB(A)] and during more time than the recommended. All workers use hearing protectors appropriately. The hearing loss prevalence in workers was 16.0%, there were not noise-induced hearing losses. The hearing threshold registered in the audiometrics test was diminished, but inside the normal threshold values. We diagnosed 12 cases of conductive hearing loss, all grade I; there were not sensorial or mixed hearing losses. There was not a relationship between the equivalent noise level and hearing loss. It is suggested the design and implantation of a program of auditory conservation to protect the health and security of the workers and to conduct a longitudinal study considering the findings of the present study as it basis."
"16882540","Hearing loss in workers exposed to toluene and noise.","In this study we investigated the risk of hearing loss among workers exposed to both toluene and noise. We recruited 58 workers at an adhesive materials manufacturing plant who were exposured to both toluene and noise [78.6-87.1 A-weighted decibels; dB(A)], 58 workers exposed to noise only [83.5-90.1 dB(A)], and 58 administrative clerks [67.9-72.6 dB(A)] at the same company. We interviewed participants to obtain sociodemographic and employment information and performed physical examinations, including pure-tone audiometry tests between 0.5 and 6 kHz. A contracted laboratory certified by the Council of Labor in Taiwan conducted on-site toluene and noise exposure measurements. The prevalence of hearing loss of &gt;or=25 dB in the toluene plus noise group (86.2%) was much greater than that in the noise-only group (44.8%) and the administrative clerks (5.0%) (p&lt;0.001). The prevalence rates were 67.2, 32.8, and 8.3% (p&lt;0.001), respectively, when 0.5 kHz was excluded from the estimation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the toluene plus noise group had an estimated risk for hearing loss&gt;or=25 dB, 10.9 times higher than that of the noise-only group. The risk ratio dropped to 5.8 when 0.5 kHz was excluded from the risk estimation. Hearing impairment was greater for the pure-tone frequency of 1 kHz than for that of 2 kHz. However, the mean hearing threshold was the poorest for 6 kHz, and the least effect was observed for 2 kHz. Our results suggest that toluene exacerbates hearing loss in a noisy environment, with the main impact on the lower frequencies."
"16871954","[Analysis of hearing threshold shift measured by otoacoustic emissions in soldiers after shooting with use hearing protectors].","BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to assess the influence of short-term impulse noise on the size of temporary threshold shift in soldiers using hearing protectors during exposure.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study covered 80 subjects with normal tympanic membrane and thresholds measured by pure tone audiometry lower than 20 dB. There were two groups: I--composed of 40 soldiers protected during shooting and II--comprised 40 young males which did not shoot (controls). Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions were performed by an ILO 292 Echoport Otodynamics device 3-5 min before shooting and 2 min, 1, 2 and 3 h after shooting.RESULTS: The results showed that post-exposure changes in soldiers who used ear-muffs were not significant.CONCLUSION: The use of hearing protectors is strongly recommended because most of them seem to sufficiently attenuate impulse noise from firearms."
"16825883","Hearing in nonprofessional pop/rock musicians.","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hearing and subjective auditory symptoms in a group of nonprofessional pop/rock musicians who had experienced repeated exposures to intense sound levels during at least 5 yr of musical activity.DESIGN: An evaluation of both ears in 42 nonprofessional pop/rock musicians included pure-tone audiometry in the conventional and extended high-frequency range, the measurement of uncomfortable loudness levels, and an assessment of tinnitus and hypersensitivity to sound. Exclusion criteria were (a) the occurrence of acoustic trauma, (b) excessive noise exposure during occupational activities, (c) a history of recurrent otitis media, (d) previous ear surgery, (e) a fracture of the cranium, (f) ingestion of potentially ototoxic drugs, and (g) reported hearing difficulties within the immediate family. These audiometric results were then compared with a control group of 20 otologically normal young adults with no history of long-term noise exposure.RESULTS: After adjusting for age and gender, relative to ISO 7029, the mean hearing threshold in the frequency range of 3 to 8 kHz was 6 dB in the musicians and 1.5 dB in the control group. This difference was statistically significant (Mann-Whitney rank sum test, p &lt; 0.001). A significant difference was also observed between musicians using regular hearing protection during their activities (average 3 to 8 kHz thresholds = 2.4 dB) and musicians who never used such hearing protection (average 3 to 8 kHz thresholds = 8.2 dB), after adjusting for age and gender (Mann-Whitney rank sum test, p = 0.006). Eleven of the musicians (26%) were found to be hypersensitive to sound, and seven (17%) presented with tinnitus. Tinnitus assessment, however, did not reveal any clinically significant psychological distress in these individuals.CONCLUSIONS: Tinnitus and hypersensitivity to sound were observed in a significant minority within a group of nonprofessional pop/rock musicians who had experienced repeated exposure to intense sound levels over at least 5 yr but with minimal impact on their lives. Moreover, hearing loss was minimal in the subjects who always used ear protection, being only 0.9 dB higher than the control group. In contrast, hearing loss was significantly more pronounced, at 6.7 dB higher than the control group, in those musicians who never used ear protection. Continued education about the risk to hearing and the benefits of the persistent use of ear protection is warranted for musicians who are exposed frequently to intense sound levels."
"16761701","Efficacy of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in protecting ears exposed to loud music.","Antioxidants have been reported to be effective in reducing acoustic trauma in animal models but have not been studied in humans. In this study, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was evaluated to determine if it would reduce temporary changes in auditory function as a result of exposure to loud music in humans. Pure-tone thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were collected in 31 normal-hearing participants, using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, before and after two hours of live music in a nightclub. Using repeated measures analysis of variance, no statistically significant differences were found between participants who received NAC versus a placebo for any of the outcome measures. Across all subjects, the largest pure-tone threshold shift occurred at 4 kHz. DPOAE measures were characterized by reductions in amplitude and a trend for shorter group delay values. When the 3 and 4 kHz data were examined by imposing specific criteria of greater than 2 dB DPOAE amplitude reductions and 10 dB or greater pure-tone threshold shifts, DPOAE reductions occurred more often at 3 kHz, and pure-tone shifts occurred more often at 4 kHz."
"16735910","Otoacoustic emissions and persistent tinnitus after acute acoustic trauma.","OBJECTIVES: To follow up the auditory status of military personnel after an acute acoustic trauma and to identify the possible predictive value of hearing thresholds and otoacoustic emissions during the first 24 hours after the acoustic trauma.STUDY DESIGN: A group of 24 young military subjects, aged 22 +/- 2.3 years, without any otologic problem before the acoustic trauma, were examined at three time intervals after an accidental acoustic trauma caused by the discharge of a firearm: 24 hours, 72 hours, and 15 days.METHODS: Each subject was submitted to medical examination and to a questionnaire detailing the circumstances of the acoustic trauma. Pure tone audiometry was performed from 1 to 8 kHz per half octave. Transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions were recorded in the nonlinear mode at 80 dB pSPL, and distortion product otoacoustic emissions were recorded from 1 to 6 kHz, using a distortion product-gram type procedure, at 65/55 dB SPL, with f2/f1 = 1.22. Two groups of subjects were defined: group 1 (n = 8) represented subjects with short-lasting tinnitus (&lt;72 h) and group 2 (n = 16) subjects with long-lasting tinnitus (&gt;72 h).RESULTS: Hearing thresholds did not differ significantly between these two groups 24 hours after the acoustic trauma. However, otoacoustic emissions showed significantly lower amplitudes 24 hours after the acoustic trauma in subjects showing a longer lasting tinnitus.CONCLUSION: Otoacoustic emissions appear to be a better predictor of the persistence of tinnitus than hearing thresholds alone 24 hours after an acute acoustic trauma."
"16717022","Hearing loss induced by occupational and impulse noise: results on threshold shifts by frequencies, age and gender from the Nord-Trøndelag Hearing Loss Study.","The aim of the study was to compare the frequency-specific effects of noise on hearing acuity across the range 250-8000 Hz and the extent to which the patterns of frequency-specific threshold shifts differ between occupational noise and impulse noise. Pure-tone audiometry was administered to an adult general population sample with 51 975 subjects who also provided questionnaire information about noise exposure and other risk factors. Threshold shifts induced by life-long occupational noise and impulse noise (mostly shooting) were estimated separately in six age and sex groups for eight frequencies. Reported noise exposure, as well as observed threshold shifts, were moderate among women. Threshold shifts averaged over both ears among subjects in the higher 2% of exposure to occupational noise, reached 13 dB (3000 Hz, age 65 years + ) among men and were generally largest at 3000-4000 Hz. The shifts induced by impulse noise reached approximately 8 dB among men 45-64 years and men 65 years+. The effects of impulse noise were strongest at 3000-8000 Hz and varied little within this frequency range."
"16704911","Occupational exposure to noise, and hearing function among electro production workers.","OBJECTIVE: The present study has the aim to investigate the prevalence and the determinants of hearing loss among electro production workers.METHODS: Ninety-three electro production workers and 51 office workers underwent audiometric test. Information regarding, socio-demographics, present and past medical history of hearing problems, use of ototoxic drugs, hobbies, and smoking habit was obtained using a self administered questionnaire.RESULTS: The levels of noise at workplace have also been measured. Electro production workers were exposed to high levels of noise. Statistical analysis has shown that 44% of electro production workers had sensorineural hearing loss located mainly at 4000 Hz. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that occupational exposure to noise appears to be the strongest predictor (odds ratio, OR: 7.51) of NIHL followed by aging (OR: 5.34), and last by smoking (OR: 2.47).CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that electro production workers are occupationally exposed to high levels of noise, and present high rates of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The observed hearing loss was located mainly at 4000 Hz. These findings underline the need for interventions to reduce the risk for the development of NIHL among electro production workers."
"16702119","Hearing loss in migrant agricultural workers.","BACKGROUND: Farmers have high rates of hearing loss, yet little is known about the hearing status of migrant agricultural workers. We performed a cross-sectional survey to assess the prevalence and impact of hearing loss in this population.METHODS: One hundred fifty migrant and seasonal agricultural workers were surveyed at a series of health fairs held at migrant camps. A bilingual questionnaire included items related to hearing loss risk factors and subjective hearing difficulties. Pure tone audiometry and tympanometry were performed in a mobile testing van.RESULTS: More than half the subjects had some degree of hearing loss at audiometric frequencies between 500 and 6,000 Hz, especially in the higher frequencies. Hispanic males in the sample had significantly greater prevalence of high-frequency hearing loss compared to adults in the national Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES). More than 35% of respondents complained of subjective difficulty hearing or understanding speech, yet no workers reported use of hearing aids. Even after adjusting for measured hearing loss, Hispanic farm workers were more likely than their English- speaking counterparts to complain of difficulty hearing or understanding speech, suggesting that language barriers could worsen the impact of hearing loss. Risk factors for hearing loss included age and abnormal tympanometry. Occupational exposures to noise from tractors and other machinery as well as pesticides were frequently reported, while use of hearing protection was rare.CONCLUSION: Hearing loss is a significant and under-recognized problem in the migrant worker population. Further preventive and treatment efforts are warranted."
"16684706","A study of hearing changes among military conscripts in the Swedish Army.","The aim of the study was to investigate the incidence and the relative risk of significant threshold shift (STS, &gt;or=15 dB deterioration at any ear and audiometric frequency) during primary military service (7-9 months), and to investigate whether subjects with an initial slight hearing loss (thresholds&gt;or=25 dB HL at any audiometric frequency and ear) were under increased risk. The investigation was made as a prospective audiometric study and included 747 men. An age-matched group of 138 individuals served as an unexposed control group, whose incidence of STS was 2.9%. In the exposed group the incidence was 7.9% and the relative risk 2.7 risk ratio (RR). In the subgroup of 95 persons, who already at reporting-for-training had a mild hearing loss, the incidence was 17%. The relative risk for STS in this group compared to the control group was 6.8 (RR), and compared to those with normal hearing at reporting was 3.1 (RR). In spite of hearing conservation efforts, hearing deterioration still occurs, above all in the artillery. Those who already at reporting-for-training had a mild hearing loss were at higher risk for STS compared to those with initially normal hearing."
"16680467","Occupational noise exposure and sensorineural hearing loss among workers of a steel rolling mill.","Hearing loss is one of the most common chronic health conditions and has important implications for the patient's quality of life. However, hearing loss is substantially underestimated and under treated. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of sensorineural hearing loss among the workers in a steel rolling mill in Nigeria. Each of the 150 randomly selected subjects had a structured questionnaire administered to them, followed by a full otological examination. Of these, 116 had tympanometry and pure-tone audiometry. Also a noise mapping of their respective work units was done. The workers were exposed to noise levels varying from 49 to 93 dBA. About 28.2% of the 103 who had their audiogram analysed had mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss in their better ear and 56.8% of them had mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss in their worse ear. The pure-tone average and the average hearing thresholds at 4 kHz for the groups significantly increased with an increasing noise exposure level. The prevalence of sensorineural hearing loss among the study population is high; and noise exposure is at least contributory. Pre-employment and regular audiometry while on the job is highly recommended."

They are continuously exposed to occupational aviation noise and therefore are at risk for chronic neurosensory hypoacusis. Pure tone audiogram registers in them a rise in hearing thresholds throughout the whole band of frequencies studied. This means that aviation maintenance staff is exposed to noise containing highly intensive infrasound and high-frequency components. The detected pathology directly correlated with duration of exposure to noise. Development of neurosensory hypoacusis in aviation maintenance specialists starts earlier than in other specialists exposed to noise."

"18034257","Is the audiologic status of professional musicians a reflection of the noise exposure in classical orchestral music?","The sound in classical orchestral music is louder than noise emissions allowed by national rules in industry. We wanted to assess the audiologic status of professional musicians at different ages of their careers and to look for a coherence of declined hearing ability and the sound emissions in order to substantiate advices for hearing protection and occupational medicine in musicians. Data from questionnaires (anamnestic data on sound exposure in profession and leisure times, use of hearing protection, self-evaluation of hearing function and hearing deficits), audiometric data and amplitudes of OAE were evaluated from 109 professional musicians aged 30-69 years from three major German orchestras and from 110 students of an academy of music (aged 11-19 years). Sound emissions of the whole orchestra and of single instruments/instrument groups were measured at the orchestra stages and pits during rehearsals and performances. None of the musicians was engaged in noisy hobbies and only a few used hearing protectors regularly. More than 50% of the musicians had a hearing loss of 15 dB(A) and more. Highest losses were found among the strings and the brass players. DPOAE amplitudes coincidently declined with the duration of performing music in the orchestras. Professional musicians aged older than 60 years had a significantly greater hearing loss at 4 and 6 kHz than those aged 30-39 years. Among the strings in one orchestra a dominant hearing deficit in the left ears was observed. Musicians need the same health care for their hearing as workers in noisy industry. A better education on the hearing hazards (use of hearing protectors) as well as sound protection in the rehearsal rooms is necessary. Hearing loss in professional musicians should be accepted as an occupational disease."
"17999904","[Acoustic trauma in classical music players].","OBJECTIVE: To confirm the existence of acoustic trauma in classical musicians.MATERIAL AND METHOD: Sixty-five volunteers from the Castilla and León Symphony Orchestra were studied. The hearing thresholds of each musician were age-corrected using the ELI and ISO 7029:2000 scales. Furthermore the sound levels of the instruments in this symphony orchestra were studied.RESULTS: We observed that the sound level of the symphony orchestra instruments is higher than the level permitted by law, ie it constitutes a risk for hearing loss. We also found that 4 kHz hearing loss in the 5th percentile among musicians was double the rate that would be expected for age, and that violinists and viola players showed poorer hearing in the left ear.CONCLUSIONS: Classical music causes acoustic trauma in musicians and should be recognized as a professional illness. Musicians are obliged to protect their hearing and to undergo regular check-ups."

Middle Ear Analyser (MEA), Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA) and Oto-Acoustic Emission (OAE) were used to evaluate changes in the hearing thresholds.RESULTS: There was a change in distortion product (DP) amplitude (temporary shift) in all frequencies. Statistically significant changes were found in the 6 kHz and 4 kHz ranges in the left ear and 6 kHz in the right ear. There was a larger DP shift in the left ear than in the right ear. A comparison of the hearing thresholds of males and females showed a significant difference of 3 kHz in the left ear, where males had a higher hearing loss.CONCLUSION: There were shifts of hearing threshold at 6 kHz and 4 kHz. The danger to hearing from dental clinic working environment in a dental school cannot be underestimated."
"17932017","Central auditory processing effects induced by solvent exposure.","OBJECTIVES: Various studies have demonstrated that organic solvent exposure may induce auditory damage. Studies conducted in workers occupationally exposed to solvents suggest, on the one hand, poorer hearing thresholds than in matched non-exposed workers, and on the other hand, central auditory damage due to solvent exposure. Taking into account the potential auditory damage induced by solvent exposure due to the neurotoxic properties of such substances, the present research aimed at studying the possible auditory processing disorder (APD), and possible hearing difficulties in daily life listening situations that solvent-exposed workers may acquire.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty workers exposed to a mixture of organic solvents (xylene, toluene, methyl ethyl ketone) and 50 non-exposed workers matched by age, gender and education were assessed. Only subjects with no history of ear infections, high blood pressure, kidney failure, metabolic and neurological diseases, or alcoholism were selected. The subjects had either normal hearing or sensorineural hearing loss, and normal tympanometric results. Hearing-in-noise (HINT), dichotic digit (DD), filtered speech (FS), pitch pattern sequence (PPS), and random gap detection (RGD) tests were carried out in the exposed and non-exposed groups. A self-report inventory of each subject's performance in daily life listening situations, the Amsterdam Inventory for Auditory Disability and Handicap, was also administered.RESULTS: Significant threshold differences between exposed and non-exposed workers were found at some of the hearing test frequencies, for both ears. However, exposed workers still presented normal hearing thresholds as a group (equal or better than 20 dB HL). Also, for the HINT, DD, PPS, FS and RGD tests, non-exposed workers obtained better results than exposed workers. Finally, solvent-exposed workers reported significantly more hearing complaints in daily life listening situations than non-exposed workers.CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that subjects exposed to solvents may acquire an APD and thus the sole use of pure-tone audiometry is insufficient to assess hearing in solvent-exposed populations."

However, when both results were considered together, the abnormal rate reached 70% (14 of 20). The hearing threshold of 4 kHz significantly associated with vestibular-evoked myogenic potential results (ie, vestibular-evoked myogenic potential was abnormal in patients with greater degrees of hearing loss), but not with caloric responses.CONCLUSION: Patients with bilateral 4-kHz notched audiogram and hearing threshold of 4 kHz &gt; 40 dB may show abnormal (absent or delayed) vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials, indicating that the vestibular part, especially the sacculocollic reflex pathway, has also been damaged."

We analyzed the relationships of cholesterol and triglyceride levels with NIHL.RESULTS: A total of 4071 cases were analyzed. After adjusting for age and gender, hypertriglyceridemia was found to be related to NIHL (aOR = 1.281; 95% CI, 1.088-1.507), but hypercholesterolemia was not (aOR = 0.951; 95% CI, 0.795-1.138).CONCLUSIONS: This study, one of the largest to date to study the relationship between hyperlipidemia and NIHL, found that individuals with hypertriglyceridemia are at greater risk of NIHL. On the basis of this finding, workers exposed to high noise levels should be educated on control of triglyceride levels to help reduce their risk of NIHL."
"17804978","An assessment of threshold shifts in nonprofessional pop/rock musicians using conventional and extended high-frequency audiometry.","The clinical value of extended high-frequency audiometry for the detection of noise-induced hearing loss has not been established conclusively. The purpose of this study was to assess the relative temporary threshold shift (TTS) in two frequency regions (conventional versus extended high frequency). In this exploratory study, pure-tone thresholds from 0.5 to 14 kHz were measured in both ears of 16 nonprofessional pop/rock musicians (mean age, 35 yr; range, 27 to 49 yr), before and after a 90-minute rehearsal session. All had experienced repeated exposures to intense sound levels during at least 5 yr of their musical careers. After the rehearsal, median threshold levels were found to be significantly poorer for frequencies from 0.5 to 8 kHz (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p &lt;or= 0.004) but were unchanged in the extended high-frequency range from 9 to 14 kHz. Decreases in the median threshold values measured before the rehearsal were present across the conventional frequency range, most notably at 6 kHz, but were not observed in the extended high-frequency range. On the basis of these results, extended high-frequency audiometry does not seem advantageous as a means of the early detection of noise-induced hearing loss."

"17721363","Otoacoustic emissions in early noise-induced hearing loss.","OBJECTIVE: To follow changes in transient evoked and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs, DPOAEs) as they relate to pure-tone audiometry (PTaud) thresholds during the first 2 years of occupational noise exposure.DESIGN: Prospective controlled.METHODS: Pure-tone audiometry thresholds, TEOAE and DPOAE amplitudes, and contralateral medial olivocochlear reflex strength were repeatedly evaluated during 2 years and compared between and within a cohort of 135 ship engine room recruits and a control group of 100 subjects with no noise exposure.RESULTS: Pure-tone audiometry thresholds for 2,000, 3,000 and 4,000 Hz in both ears were significantly elevated in the study group after 2 years of noise exposure. Significantly lower TEOAE amplitudes were found at 2,000 Hz in the right ear and 2,000 and 4,000 Hz in the left ear. Longitudinal intrasubject analysis of the study group revealed significant reductions of TEOAE amplitudes at 2,000 to 4,000 Hz in both ears and reduced DPOAE amplitudes for 5,957 Hz in the right ear and 3,809, 4,736, and 5,957 Hz in the left ear in the second follow-up evaluation. Baseline medial olivocochlear reflex strength showed no correlation to PTaud thresholds after 2 years of noise exposure. Poor to moderate negative linear correlations (r = -0.07 to -0.37) were found between the DPOAE-averaged amplitudes at 2,979 to 5,957 Hz and PTaud threshold means at 3,000 to 6,000 Hz. Abnormal TEOAE parameters after the first year of noise exposure had high sensitivity (86-88%) and low specificity (33-35%) for the prediction of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) after 2 years.CONCLUSION: The DP-gram is not significantly correlated with PTaud and cannot be used as an objective measure of pure-tone thresholds in early NIHL. Medial olivocochlear reflex strength before the beginning of chronic exposure to occupational noise has no relation to individual vulnerability to NIHL. Although TEOAEs changes after 1 year showed high sensitivity in predicting NIHL after 2 years of exposure, they cannot be recommended as an efficient screening tool due to high false-positive rates."

Blocking the signal pathway with D-JNKI-1 is therefore a promising way to protect the morphological integrity and physiological function of the inner ear in various conditions involving acute sensorineural hearing loss.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: For the first application of AM-111 in humans, we organized a clinical phase I/II trial in patients with acute acoustic trauma after exposure to firecrackers in Berlin and Munich on New Year's Eve 2005/2006. We randomly selected 11 patients for intratympanic treatment with AM-111 at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml or 2 mg/ml within 24 h after noise exposure. Pure tone audiometry and otoacoustic emissions were assessed before treatment and on days 3 and 30 thereafter.RESULTS: Based on clinical experience and on a calculation using an empirically derived exponential hearing recovery function AM-111 seems to have had a therapeutic effect. A total of 13 adverse events were reported in 5 study participants. None of the adverse events were serious or severe."
"17687184","Age-related hearing loss and blood pressure.","A review of the literature studying possible correlations between hearing function and cardiovascular disease (CVD) reveals a complex and somewhat contradictory picture. Most studies favor the concept of an association between hearing loss and CVD. The issue of interactions between noise-induced hearing loss and CVD, as well as between age-related hearing loss and CVD, has been discussed in numerous publications. The present study utilizes information from an epidemiological study of elderly people in Gothenburg, Sweden. We found a probable correlation between high systolic blood pressure and hearing loss in the low and mid frequencies in elderly women, 79 years old. A tendency of a similar correlation was also found in a group of 85-year-old women. An association between high diastolic blood pressure and low- and mid-frequency hearing loss was also found in the group of women aged 85 years. No consistent associations between blood pressure or hypertension and auditory function were found in 70- and 75-year-old women or in men 70 to 85 years old."

In total, 39 normal-hearing humans were monaurally exposed to a 1-kHz tone lasting for 3 min at an equivalent threshold sound-pressure level of 105.5 dB. The effects of overexposure were studied in two experiments (1) on the broadband DPOAE and (2) on the DPOAE fine structure, measured using a higher frequency resolution in a narrower frequency range. The obtained DPOAE shifts were compared to temporary threshold shift (TTS) obtained after a similar exposure. Similarities between DPOAE shifts and TTS were found in the affected frequency range and the time course of recovery. The amount of TTS was higher in the early recovery time (1-4-min postexposure), but similar to the DPOAE shift (even in absolute terms) at later recovery times (5-20-min postexposure).

Study model - a prospective clinical trial.</AbstractText>: Teachers frequently report auditory symptoms and excessive noise in classrooms, but noise level measurements are not done routinely. Study model - a prospective clinical trial.AIM: To study auditory symptoms and audiometric exams of teachers and classroom noise levels.MATERIAL AND METHOD: Data from two groups, GI (40 teachers) and GII (40 voluntaries) were studied as follows: age, gender, working conditions, audiometric exams, and classroom noise levels.RESULTS: In GI there were more females (86%), working in basic teaching (75%), in classes with 21-40 students (70%), with workloads between 26 and 40 hours per week (47%), and variable professional teaching time. Most teachers in GI reported excessive classroom noise (93.5%) and auditory symptoms (65%). In GI, 25% of teachers presented audiometric alterations (versus 10% of controls), with an acoustic notch predominating (11.25%; p&lt;0.05). Noise levels close to 87dBA were recorded in classes at all teaching levels.CONCLUSIONS: occupational hearing loss may occur in teachers. Further studies are needed to confirm this proposition."
"17497600","[Asymmetrical hearing loss following symmetrical acute acoustic trauma].","Due to diffraction, acute acoustic trauma usually causes symmetrical hearing loss. Acoustical shadow effects are relevant only at distances greater than 1 m to the sound source and frequencies greater than 1000 Hz. In case of pronounced asymmetrical hearing loss causal connection to acute acoustic trauma is unlikely. We describe two cases with pronounced asymmetrical hearing loss in spite of symmetrical acute acoustic trauma. In the first case two patients headed an exploding giant tyre in a distance of approximately 1-2 m. One of them--as expected--got a symmetrical inner ear damage. On the other hand the other patient, which stayed directly besides him, got a pronounced asymmetrical inner ear damage. In an additional case we found also asymmetrical inner ear damage after symmetrical noise exposure. In this case it was detected, that years ago the patient suffered from a menieriform attack in the now worse ear. Occult inner ear damage is discussed as a reason for the phenomenon of pronounced asymmetrical inner ear damage after symmetrical noise exposure."
"17484317","Noise-induced hearing loss caused by gunshot in South Korean military service.","BACKGROUND: Noise-induced hearing loss is a preventive disease and yet the effective treatment modality has not been established. Acute acoustic traumas caused by an exposure to gunshot noise are common in young South Korean males in military service. Considering the significant lack of awareness on this serious issue as well as the absence of proper protective gear, an in-depth analysis is desperately needed.METHOD: All 3650 soldiers performed regular periodic gunfire exercise without any hearing protective measures. Seven patients with hearing impairment after periodic gunfire visited the aeromedical squadron; all were right-handed males. Six were tested with the K-2 rifle and one was tested with a K-5 revolver. History taking, physical examination, pure-tone audiometry, and impedance audiometry were conducted. In the next periodic gunfire exercise, all 3650 soldiers performed gunfire with unilateral hearing protection.RESULTS: The average outcome of postexposure air conduction thresholds was 6.5 dB in the right ear and 33.1 dB in the left ear. After medical treatment, hearing impairment was much improved; however, tinnitus was not diminished. In the next periodic gunfire exercise, the result of a supplement of unilateral earplug protection proved its effectiveness on acoustic trauma caused by gunfire noise.CONCLUSION: Asymmetry in hearing loss is related to the position of the head during gunfire. A unilateral hearing protection device was enough to protect hearing from gunfire noise. At the same time, it can effectively prevent a potential firearm accident that can be caused by trainees mishearing the instruction of a firearm instructor if both earplugs are worn. Thus, providing a unilateral earplug for protection against acoustic trauma must be taken into serious consideration."
"17478967","Effect of exposure to a mixture of solvents and noise on hearing and balance in aircraft maintenance workers.","Aircraft maintenance workers are exposed to a mixture of solvents in the presence of intermittent noise. For this study these workers exposed to solvent mix and noise, were compared with mill workers exposed to noise alone, printed circuit board operatives exposed to solvents alone and those exposed to none who acted as controls. Tympanometry, acoustic reflex thresholds, transient and distortion product otoacoustic emissions, auditory brainstem potentials, nystagmography and posturography were examined. There was a significant effect on pure tone thresholds for both noise and solvents+noise. The distortion product otoacoustic emissions declined with frequency and exhibited lower DP amplitude with noise compared to solvents and noise group. The transient emissions showed a similar effect. Over 32% of subjects with solvent and noise exposure had abnormalities of the auditory brainstem responses in terms of interwave interval prolongation. The mean acoustic reflex thresholds showed a pattern of differences which differentiate noise from solvent and noise groups. The contralateral pathway appears to be differentially affected by solvent exposure. 32% of subjects in the solvents and noise group had an abnormal posturographic finding. In the solvents and noise group 74% had abnormalities of saccades, 56% of pursuit and 45% of optokinetic nystagmus."

The records of environmental noise and solvents measurements and the results of annual audiometry performed by the company were examined. The audiometric results of workers from olefin operational areas 1 and 2 and aromatic plant areas exposed to solvents and noise and utility area workers exposed only to noise were analyzed for the standard threshold shift (STS). Despite the low exposures to solvents and a moderate exposure to noise, 45.3% of workers had hearing losses and 29.6% had STS."
"17478963","Sleep quality in noise exposed Brazilian workers.","This study investigated the effect of chronic workplace exposure to excessive noise on sleep quality. It involved 40 male workers aged 33 to 50 years, 20 of whom had been exposed to environmental workplace noise levels of 85 dB or more on 40-hour-a-week jobs. Another 20 workers who were not exposed to excessive noise were used as controls. All subjects were interviewed and submitted to physical examination, pure tone and speech audiometry, immittance testing and nocturnal polysomnography. Comparative analysis demonstrated that the two groups were similar, except for the exposure to noise. Fisher's test comparison of pure tone and speech audiometry and immittance testing revealed mild to moderate noise-induced hearing loss (P &lt; 0.001) in the &gt; or = 85-dB group. Indicators of sleep continuity were abnormal in both groups, demonstrating poor sleep quality; however, sleep quantity was normal. Of the 40 individuals, 13 (32.5%) presented respiratory sleep disorders. Of those 13, 10 presented daytime somnolence according to the Epworth Scale. The Mann-Whitney test showed that sleep was identical in the two groups. Fisher's exact test revealed no association between altered sleep and hearing status in either group. Our results show that active men working 40-hour-a-week in the presence of excessive noise without adequate protection for more than eight years presented with noise-induced hearing loss but their quality or quantity of night sleep was unaffected. Sensori-neural deafness may represent an element of adaptation against noise during sleep."
"17402219","Individual susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss: choosing an optimal method of retrospective classification of workers into noise-susceptible and noise-resistant groups.","OBJECTIVES: Individual susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) depends on the interaction between intrinsic and environmental factors. To proceed with the study on NIHL susceptibility genes an appropriate selection of workers susceptible and resistant to noise is crucial. The aim of the study was to compare four different methods of subject classification by the susceptibility to NIHL in a group of 949 workers of an electric power plant exposed to steady-state noise at the workplace.MATERIALS AND METHODS: One method based the classification of the workers on the international reference standard ISO 1999:1990; from the entire group of workers, 10% of the subjects with the worst hearing thresholds (HT) in the model were categorized as susceptible to NIHL, whereas 10% of the subjects with the best HT were categorized as resistant to noise. According to three other methods, the entire group of workers was first divided into subgroups by age, duration of employment and the level of noise, and then 10% of the subjects at each HT extreme were selected.RESULTS: The first classification allowed to achieve an excellent separation between HT of the susceptible and resistant subgroups. The susceptible subgroup was significantly younger than the resistant one, showed a shorter duration of employment and a lower level of noise exposure, which is in line with the definition of increased vulnerability to NIHL. The three other methods produced poorer separation of HT with smaller or no gap between HT values in subgroups.CONCLUSIONS: The selection of subjects from the entire worker population of a given industry based on the ISO 1999:1990 standard can be regarded as the most reliable method of classification of noise-susceptible and noise-resistant workers to be used in the future genetic studies on NIHL susceptibility genes."
"17298149","Hearing-impairment among workers in a surface gold mining company in Ghana.","A study to determine the impact of hazardous noise on workers was conducted in a surface gold mining company in Ghana. The procedure adopted included noise survey, case history, otoscopy and conventional pure-tone audiometry. Five main areas were surveyed for hazardous noise namely, Pit, Processing, Ana Laboratory, Bore-hole and Mess area. The results showed that all the above areas except the Mess area produced noise levels above 85 dBA. Again, a total of 252 workers were seen at the company, and out of this number 59(23%) had the classical noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) at 4 KHz. In addition, NIHL increased as a function of age and duration of exposure. It is also noted that out of 81 workers with a preemployment history of noise exposure, 41(51%) had NIHL. NIHL also varied with regard to job location. 14(6%) of the workers had hearing loss greater than 25 dB at the speech frequencies. Thus, factors not under the control of the company may affect the hearing of an employee."
"17228988","Efficacy of a computer-based hearing test and tailored hearing protection intervention.","Advances in computer technology and accessibility enable researchers to provide individually tailored interventions for behavioral change. Using multimedia technology, this study developed and tested a computer-based hearing test and a tailored intervention. The purpose of this study was to evaluate, using a randomized experimental design, the efficacy of the intervention to increase workers' use of hearing protection. The tailored intervention developed by the research team showed more significant short-term effect measured immediately after the intervention than the control intervention. For the long-term effect measured 1 year after the intervention, both tailored and control groups showed significant increase in their reported use (7% vs. 6%) from preintervention to postintervention, but no significant difference between the two groups. The change accomplished in this study was small progress toward the desired level of 100% use of hearing protection to prevent noise-induced hearing loss. This finding showed that changing workers' hearing protection behavior is difficult."
"17202923","Intratympanic dexamethasone for sudden sensorineural hearing loss after failure of systemic therapy.","OBJECTIVE: Intratympanic steroids are increasingly used in the treatment of inner ear disorders, especially in patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) who have failed systemic therapy. We reviewed our experience with intratympanic steroids in the treatment of patients with sudden SNHL to determine overall success, morbidity, and prognostic factors.HYPOTHESIS: Intratympanic steroids have minimal morbidity and the potential to have a positive effect on hearing recovery in patients with sudden SNHL who have failed systemic therapy.STUDY DESIGN: The authors conducted a retrospective review.METHODS: Patients presenting with sudden SNHL defined as a rapid decline in hearing over 3 days or less affecting 3 or more frequencies by 30 dB or greater who underwent intratympanic steroids therapy (24 mg/mL dexamethasone) were reviewed. Excluded were patients with Meniere disease, retrocochlear disease, autoimmune HL, trauma, fluctuating HL, radiation-induced HL, noise-induced HL, or any other identifiable etiology for sudden HL. Patients who showed signs of fluctuation of hearing after injection were excluded. Pretreatment and posttreatment audiometric evaluations including pure-tone average (PTA) and speech reception threshold (SRT) were analyzed. Patient variables as they related to recovery were studied and included patient age, time to onset of therapy, status of the contralateral ear, presence of diabetes, severity of HL, and presence of associated symptoms (tinnitus, vertigo). A 20-dB gain in PTA or a 20% improvement in SDS was considered significant.RESULTS: : Forty patients fit the criteria for inclusion in the study. The mean age of the patients was 54.8 years with a range from 17 to 84 years of age. Overall, 40% (n = 16) showed any improvement in PTA or SDS. Fourteen (35%) men and 26 (65%) women were included. Using the criteria of 20-dB improvement in PTA or 20% improvement in SDS for success, 27.5% (n = 11) showed improvement. The mean number of days from onset of symptoms to intratympanic therapy was 40 days with a range of 7 days to 310 days. A statistically significant difference was noted in those patients who received earlier injection (P = .0008, rank sum test). No patient receiving intratympanic dexamethasone after 36 days recovered hearing using 20-dB PTA decrease or a 20% increase in discrimination as criteria for recovery. Twelve percent (n = 5) of patients in the study had diabetes with 20% recovering after intratympanic dexamethasone (not significantly different from nondiabetics at 28.6%, Fisher exact test, P = 1.0). Comparison to other studies that used differing steroid type, concentration, dosing schedule, inclusion criteria, and criteria for success revealed, in many instances, a similar overall recovery rate.CONCLUSIONS: Difficulty in proving efficacy of a single modality is present in all studies on SNHL secondary to multiple treatment protocols, variable rates of recovery, and a high rate of spontaneous recovery. Forty percent of patients showed some improvement in SDS or PTA after treatment failure. When criteria of 20-dB PTA or 20% is considered to define improvement, the recovery rate was 27.5%. Modest improvement is seen with the current protocol of a single intratympanic steroid injection of 24 mg/mL dexamethasone in patients who failed systemic therapy. Dramatic hearing recovery in treatment failures was rarely encountered. No patient showed significant benefit from intratympanic steroids after 36 days when using this protocol for idiopathic sudden SNHL. If patients injected after 6 weeks are excluded from the study, the improvement rate increases from 26.9% to 39.3%. Earlier intratympanic injection had a significant impact on hearing recovery, although with any therapeutic intervention for sudden SNHL, early success may be attributed to natural history. If we further exclude seven patients treated with intratympanic steroids within 2 weeks of the onset of symptoms (i.e., study only those patients treated with intratympanic dexamethasone between 2 and 6 weeks after onset of symptoms), still, 26% improved by 20 dB or 20% SDS. The recovery rates after initial systemic failure are higher than would be expected in this treatment failure group given our control group (9.1%) and literature review. These findings indicate a positive effect from steroid perfusion in this patient population."

"19052439","Audiological findings in individuals exposed to organic solvents: case studies.","Millions of people around the world are exposed to industrial organic solvents such as toluene and xylene in the manufacturing sectors. Solvents are neurotoxic substances that are detrimental to the functioning of the nervous system, including the central auditory nervous system (CANS). This study investigated hearing and auditory processing in seven individuals with a history of exposure to industrial solvents. A battery of audiological tests was administered to all subjects: pure tone, speech, and impedance audiometry, otoacoustic emissions tests, auditory brainstem responses, middle latency responses, as well as the SCAN-A and R-SPIN tests with low predictability sentence lists. All individuals in this study exhibited findings consistent with retrocochlear and/or central abnormality. Two of the seven subjects in this study had normal pure tone thresholds at all frequencies bilaterally, yet showed abnormal retrocochlear/central results on one or more tests. The auditory test battery approach used in this study appears to be valuable in evaluating the pathological conditions of the CANS in solvent-exposed individuals."
"19042192","The effects of toluene plus noise on hearing thresholds: an evaluation based on repeated measurements in the German printing industry.","OBJECTIVES: The ototoxicity of occupational exposure to toluene plus noise was investigated in a longitudinal study in rotogravure printing and existing findings in the literature were evaluated.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprised four repeated examinations during 5 years and started with 333 male workers. Lifetime weighted average exposures (LWAE) to toluene and noise were determined from individual work histories and historic recordings; recent individual exposures were measured 10 times during the study (toluene, active sampling; noise, stationary measurements). Auditory thresholds were measured with pure tone audiometry at 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 kHz.RESULTS: Mean LWAE exposures to toluene and noise were 45+/-17 ppm plus 82+/-7 dB(A) for high toluene exposed and 10+/-7 ppm plus 82+/-4 dB(A) for low toluene exposed subjects, mean current exposures were 26+/-20 ppm plus 81+/-4 dB(A) and 3+/-3 ppm plus 82+/-4 dB(A). Mean exposure duration was 21.3+/-6.5 years for long exposed and 5.9+/-2.2 years for short exposed subjects. Repeated measurement analyses of variance did not reveal effects of toluene intensity, exposure duration and interactions between toluene intensity and noise intensity. Noise intensity [79+/-3 dB(A) vs. 84+/-1 dB(A)] was significant for auditory thresholds. A case concept utilising developments of individual auditory thresholds did not reveal significant toluene effects. Logistic models including age, exposure duration, toluene in ambient air, current noise and either hippuric acid or ortho-cresol (o-cresol) found only age to be significant for elevated OR of high frequency hearing loss.CONCLUSIONS: Due to missing toluene effects, it was concluded that the threshold level for developing hearing loss as a result of occupational exposure to toluene plus noise might be above the current limit of 50 ppm toluene."
"18972126","Hearing status among cabin crew in a Swedish commercial airline company.","PURPOSE: To study hearing loss in commercial airline cabin crew (CC).METHODS: Totally 155 male and 781 female CC (n = 936) in a Swedish airline company underwent repeated audiometric tests during 1974-2005. The last test was used to study hearing loss. The mean test values at 3, 4, 6 kHz were used for the ear with worse hearing loss. Data were compared with a Swedish population (n = 603) who were not occupationally exposed to noise. Equivalent noise levels (Leq) were measured in different aircraft.RESULTS: Leq was 78-84 dB (A), maximum A-weighted exposure was 114 dB. Median values for all ages were close to the reference group. No association was found between years of employment and hearing loss, when adjusting for age and gender by multiple logistic regression analysis.CONCLUSION: Cabin crew are exposed to equivalent noise levels below the current Swedish occupational standard, and have normal age-matched hearing threshold levels."
"18939709","Noise-induced hearing loss and hearing aids requirement.","Subjective disturbances, due to hearing loss, are auditory disability and handicap which can be evaluated with a questionnaire. The present study refers to a population of industrial workers affected by noise-induced hearing loss. Aim of the study is to identify the minimal level of hearing loss over which the patient felt changes in his quality of life, and the average auditory threshold at which the patient considered the application of a hearing aid useful or necessary. The sample comprised 180 males with noise-induced hearing loss. Each subject received a questionnaire designed for this study. Data show a correlation between disability, handicap and the degree of noise-induced hearing loss. The most relevant problems in noise-induced hearing loss are correlated with disability rather than handicap. 35 dB can be considered as the level above which these devices can be suggested to patients. Hearing aids can become a therapeutic instrument even in the presence of a low degree of hearing loss."
"18936359","Physiological and morphological assessment of the saccule in Guinea pigs after noise exposure.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the saccule exhibits temporary or permanent functional loss resembling threshold shifts in auditory brainstem response (ABR) of guinea pigs following noise exposure.DESIGN: Randomly bred guinea pigs were divided into 3 groups: A (short-term noise exposure, 30 minutes, n = 15), B (long-term noise exposure, 40 hours, n = 9), and C (no noise exposure, n = 5).SETTING: University hospital.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All animals underwent vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) and ABR tests. Chronological changes of VEMP and ABR responses following noise exposure were analyzed and compared. After audiovestibular function testing, animals were killed for morphological study with light and electron microscopy.RESULTS: In group A, temporary VEMP loss and ABR threshold shifts recovered 2 and 4 days, respectively, after short-term noise exposure, with an interval of 2 days earlier in the recovery of VEMPs than that of ABR thresholds. In contrast, in group B, 78% and 83% of the ears exhibited permanent VEMP loss and ABR threshold shifts, respectively, 10 days following long-term noise exposure. In group C, all animals showed normal VEMPs and ABRs throughout the study period. Light and electron microscopic studies confirmed that loss of VEMPs correlated with saccular lesion.CONCLUSIONS: The saccule can exhibit temporary or permanent functional loss resembling hearing threshold shifts in guinea pigs following noise exposure. Recovery of VEMP precedes restoration of hearing threshold after damage from short-term noise exposure. Conversely, permanent VEMP loss after long-term noise exposure may reflect permanent hearing threshold shifts."
"18839846","Evaluation of noise-induced hearing loss with audiometer and distortion product otoacoustic emissions.","OBJECTIVE: To compare the results of audiogram and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) parameters between staffs working in a noisy environment and normal subjects.MATERIAL AND METHOD: Hearing function of 32 noise-exposed workers and 18 reference subjects were assessed with DPOAEs and pure-tone audiometry. Results were compared among three groups: 1) ears of reference subjects, 2) audiometrically normal ears of noise-exposed subjects, and 3) audiometrically abnormal ears of noise-exposed subjects.RESULTS: DPOAEs parameters, statistically significant difference were found between group 1 and 2 and group 1 and 3 at all frequencies. Statistically significant differences in pass rate for DPOAEs at 4-6 kilohertz (kHz) were also found between group 1 and 2.CONCLUSION: DPOAEs are more sensitive than audiometry to detect pre-symptomatic inner ear damage. It may play a role as screening and monitoring test for noise-exposed workers."
"18616091","Course of hearing recovery according to frequency in patients with acute acoustic sensorineural hearing loss.","Through pure-tone audiometry, we studied the course of hearing recovery in 24 ears of 20 men (ages 18-48 years) who had acute acoustic sensorineural hearing loss (ASHL). All subjects were members of the Japanese Self-Defense Force. The hearing level in 5 ears returned to normal, the hearing level of 13 ears recovered but was not within the normal range, and the hearing level of 6 ears was unchanged. The time from noise exposure to presentation was longer in patients with unchanged hearing than in other patients. Recovery of hearing was poorest at 4,000 Hz, followed by 8,000 and 2,000 Hz. We concluded that hearing in patients with acute ASHL is likely to return to normal when the hearing level at 4,000 Hz recovers gradually; partial recovery of hearing is expected when the hearing level at 4,000 Hz reaches an early plateau."

A total of 634 male and 30 female pilots (N=664) in a Swedish airline company underwent repeated audiological tests during the period 1974-2005. The last test was used to study hearing impairment. The mean values for the hearing test at 3, 4, and 6 kHz were used for the ear with worse hearing impairment. Data was compared with a general adult Swedish population (n=603) not occupationally exposed to noise. Equivalent noise levels gate to gate (Leq) were measured in the cockpit of different aircraft. Leq was 75-81 dB (A), peak exposures were 105 dB (A) from the cabin call signal. Median values were similar as in the reference group at all ages. There was no association between years of employment, tobacco smoking, and hearing impairment, when adjusted for age and gender by multiple logistic regressions analysis.

"18587592","Can Rh antigens be a risk factor in noise-induced hearing loss?","Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is one of the most common occupational problems and is one of the main causes of deafness. Many factors cause NIHL. Individual susceptibility is one of them. Rhesus (Rh) antigens and ABO blood groups can be factors in determining individual susceptibility. We aim to investigate the relationship between the Rh antigens and NIHL. The study was conducted in 438 factory workers who had been exposed to a noise level more than 85 dB for 8 h a day for a period of &gt;/=15 years. The audiologic results and blood groups were obtained from the individual health records of the factory workers. We determined NIHL in 236 (53.9%) workers. Two hundred and nineteen (55.4%) of Rh-positive workers and seventeen (39.5%) of Rh-negative workers have NIHL, and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05), whereas no statistically significant difference was determined between the NIHL and ABO blood groups. In conclusion, we suggest that the people with Rh-positive blood group are more prone to develop NIHL."

To establish age- and sex-adjusted normative hearing thresholds based on results of subjects free of noise and ototoxic drug exposure and to compare them with hearing thresholds of exposed (E) subjects.DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of a longitudinal epidemiologic cohort study.SETTING: Montpellier suburb, south of France.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 778 subjects 70 years old and older were examined. Noise exposure, ototoxic medication use, and medical history were collected. Hearing thresholds were obtained via pure-tone audiometry. After excluding patients with ear-related disease, 659 subjects were further analyzed (270 men and 389 women). Noise or ototoxic medication exposure was found in 364 subjects (E subjects), whereas 295 had no exposure (nonexposed [NE] subjects).METHODS: Median pure-tone thresholds, lower deviation, and upper deviation were calculated for the NE subjects with a statistical method similar to the ISO 7029 norm and were compared with thresholds of E subjects.RESULTS: Hearing thresholds, especially in high frequencies, increased with age more for women than for men. Median thresholds of E subjects were significantly higher than those for the NE sample in men.CONCLUSION: Age- and sex-adjusted hearing thresholds could well be useful in the study of the impact of environmental and genetic factors on hearing loss in the elderly. The next step would be to quantify the impact of noise, ototoxic drug exposure, and genetics using these age- and sex-adjusted thresholds."
"18479630","Occupational noise-induced tinnitus: does it affect workers' quality of life?","OBJECTIVES: This prospective study aimed to investigate the quality of life of workers in a steel factory.METHODS: The study group was composed of 16 male workers with tinnitus and 30 ears. Fifteen male workers without tinnitus and 30 ears were included into the control group. Workers were evaluated by questionnaire, pure-tone audiometry, and the SF-36 Health Survey. In the study group, tinnitus loudness levels (TLLs) were found.RESULTS: In the study group, the domains general mental health and role limitations owing to emotional problems were significantly lower than in the control group. Older age, industrial noise exposure over a long period, higher noise exposure during work, and hearing loss secondary to occupational noise caused workers to experience higher TLLs. Earheadings protected workers more than earplugs, and TLLs were lower. Important factors that affect workers' quality of life are maximum exposed noise levels, daily and total noise exposure time, and exposure to continuous noise. Occupational noise-induced tinnitus mainly causes emotional disability rather than physical disability. Emotionally impaired QOL results may be due to tinnitus-related psychological problems.CONCLUSION: Workers should have knowledge about the hazardous effects of noise. Periodic health checkups and regular seminars have great importance. Workers must be aware of other ototoxic factors, such as medications and noisy music. In the future, researchers should develop a screening method to detect those with a more hereditary affinity to hearing loss."
"18469718","The burdens of age-related and occupational noise-induced hearing loss in the United States.","OBJECTIVES: Aging and noise are generally considered the most common causes of adult hearing loss in developed countries. This study estimates the contributions of aging and occupational noise in the United States.DESIGN: A model of hearing loss burden in American adults was constructed using data from the Census Bureau, from an international standard that predicts age-related and noise-induced hearing loss (ISO-1999), from the American Medical Association method of determining hearing impairment, and from sources estimating the distribution of occupational noise exposure in different age and sex groups.RESULTS: Occupational noise exposure probably accounts for less than 10% of the burden of adult hearing loss in the United States; most of the rest is age-related. Most of the occupational noise burden is attributable to unprotected exposures above 95 dBA, and becomes apparent in middle age, when occupational noise exposure has ceased but age-related threshold shifts are added to prior noise-induced shifts, resulting in clinically significant impairment.CONCLUSIONS: In our current state of knowledge, noise-induced hearing loss is still the most important preventable cause of hearing loss in the United States. The burden of occupational noise-induced hearing loss could probably be reduced by stricter enforcement of existing regulations. Longer lifespans in developed countries and migration of manufacturing jobs to developing countries will continue to reduce the relative contribution of occupational hearing loss in countries like the United States. Preventive interventions for age-related hearing loss, even if only partially effective, could potentially reduce the burden of adult hearing loss more than elimination of occupational noise."

These patients were divided into three groups: (1) group A (20 patients) in which the treatment began within the first hour after the AAT, (2) group B (17 patients) in which the treatment started more than 1 h later and less than 16 h after the AAT and (3) group C (15 patients) in which the treatment began after 24 h or more. One month after the treatment onset, 36 (69%) patients of all the groups showed hearing improvement (complete-partial recovery) in the pure tone audiometry. The greater number of patients who showed complete recovery after AAT was noted in group A (65%) compared to group B (23.5%) and C (13.3%). Moreover, in group A, in the final audiogram, the averaged hearing threshold was statistically better (P &lt; 0.001) than that of groups B and C. In spite of the lack of control group, our data demonstrated the possible effectiveness of the immediate onset of treatment of AAT."

Main questions are: (1) Should musicians be treated as a special group with regard to hearing, noise, and noise related hearing problems (2) Do patterns of hearing damage differ for different instrument types (3) Do OAE have an added value in the diagnosis of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) in musicians.METHODS: 241 professional musicians, aged between 23-64 participated. A brief medical history and the subjective judgment of their hearing and hearing problems were assessed. Musicians were subjected to an extensive audiological test battery, which contained testing of audiometric thresholds, loudness perception, diplacusis, tinnitus, speech perception in noise, and otoacoustic emissions.RESULTS: Most musicians could be categorized as normal hearing, but their audiograms show notches at 6 kHz, a frequency that is associated with NIHL. Musicians often complained about tinnitus and hyperacusis, while diplacusis was generally not reported as a problem. Tinnitus was most often localized utmost left and this could not be related to the instrument. It was usually perceived in high frequency areas, associated with NIHL. In general, musicians scored very well on the speech-in-noise test. The results of the loudness perception test were within normal limits. Otoacoustic emissions were more intense with better pure-tone thresholds, but due to large individual differences it can still not be used as an objective test for early detection of NIHL.CONCLUSIONS: Musicians show more noise induced hearing loss than could be expected on the basis of age and gender. Other indicators, such as complaints and prevalence of tinnitus, complaints about hyperacusis and prevalence of diplacusis suggest that musicians' ears are at risk. Continuing education about the risks of intensive sound exposure to musicians, with the emphasis on the possible development of tinnitus and hyperacusis and the need for good hearing protection is warranted."
"18363008","Effect of basic military training on hearing in the Singapore Armed Forces.","INTRODUCTION: In the military service, hearing is at risk through exposure to impulse noise from firing and detonations. This study aims at looking into the consequences of military training on hearing acuity, as it would be useful to confirm the effectiveness of the hearing conservation programme in the Singapore Armed Forces.METHODS: A self-controlled study of 118 Singapore military conscripts was carried out, using questionnaires administered by trained personnel and pure tone audiometric assessments performed for both ears. The questionnaire and audiometry were done at the start of basic military training (BMT), with follow-up audiometry done at the end of BMT and one year into vocational military training (VT).RESULTS: 33 military conscripts were excluded subsequently in latter phases of the study. Of the 85 remaining conscripts, 16.5 percent of the study population were found to have abnormal audiograms at the start of BMT. At the end of the BMT phase, the percentage of enlistees with abnormal audiograms was 9.4 percent. By the end of one year of VT, the percentage of enlistees with abnormal audiograms was still 9.4 percent. Analysis of the differences in number of enlistees with hearing loss was done with the McNemar's test, and was found to be statistically insignificant (p-value equals 0.238).CONCLUSION: The prevalence of 16.5 percent abnormal audiograms at the pre-BMT stage is probably related to unfamiliarity with the audiogram testing and/or &quot;temporary threshold shift&quot; effect. There was no significant difference in the number of enlistees with hearing loss upon enlistment and after one year of military training in this cohort of soldiers."
"18307091","Iris pigmentation and susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss.","The purpose of this retrospective study is to examine the possible association between iris pigmentation and susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss in 2407 noise-exposed workers. The workers were between 16 to 65 years of age and were exposed to 2 to 42 years of work-related noise. Results demonstrated that dark-eyed workers presented a greater percentage of normal pure-tone thresholds than fair-eyed workers. Fair-eyed workers had threshold averages of 25.1 dB (right ear) and 26.0 dB (left ear) at 3, 4, and 6 kHz, which were significantly worse than workers with dark irises, with threshold averages of 15.8 dB and 17.2 dB in the right and left ear, respectively (p&lt;0.01). Fair-eyed workers with less than 10 years of noise exposure had the same audiometric pattern as the dark-eyed workers exposed for more than 10 years. Workers not exposed to noise did not present significant differences in their audiometric pattern as a function of eye colour. These results suggest that iris pigmentation may be an additional indication of susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss."
"18307090","The risk of tinnitus following occupational noise exposure in workers with hearing loss or normal hearing.","The purpose was to investigate the relationship between noise exposure and tinnitus among workers with normal hearing and hearing loss, respectively. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 752 workers employed at 91 workplaces, that were investigated by means of full work-shift noise levels, questionnaire data, and bilateral pure-tone audiometry. Tinnitus was not associated with the present noise level, the duration of noise exposure, or the cumulative noise exposure if participants had normal hearing. As expected, such trends were demonstrated if participants had a hearing handicap. Based on these data, we will be cautious in ascribing tinnitus to noise exposure in our patients' workplaces if they have a normal audiogram. Furthermore our data indicates no risk of noise-induced tinnitus at exposure levels where no hearing loss would be expected, e.g. as usually encountered in non-industrial workplaces."

Sound pressure levels were measured during a rehearsal, indicating mean levels ranging from 96.4 dB(A) to 106.9 dB(A). Subjects answered questionnaires and underwent audiometry. They attended a lecture in which folders and hearing protection aids were provided; subjects were asked to try using the protectors for 3 months.RESULTS: At the end of the study period, 56.2% reported not liking hearing protection, while 43.7 % accepted such protection. The most common complaints were discomfort with sounds (58.8 %) and tinnitus (47%). 77.1% said that music might cause hearing impairment. A statistically significant difference was observed in the right ear at 4 and 6 kHz and at the left ear in 3, 4 and 6 kHz when median thresholds were compared with those from unexposed controls.CONCLUSION: Although most subjects seemed aware of the risk, few took preventive measures against hearing loss. This suggests the need for periodic educational campaigns and specific legislation tailored to music professionals."
"18165194","Relationship between styrene exposure and hearing loss: review of human studies.","Styrene is an aromatic solvent belonging to the alkylbenzene family. Occupational exposure to styrene occurs mainly in the manufacturing of fiberglass-reinforced polyester products, e.g. reinforced plastics and composites. Since 1988, nine studies have been published on the relationship between occupational exposure to styrene and hearing loss. All studies were the cross-sectional epidemiological studies or clinical studies from occupational health clinics. A total of more than 1000 workers exposed to styrene, both with and without concurrent noise exposure, were examined using different outcome measures for hearing loss. Exposure assessment was usually based on styrene measurements in the breathing zone during several hours of one working day. Some of the studies employed also the biological monitoring of styrene exposure based on determination of its urinary metabolites. The current exposures to styrene varied between 2 and 35 ppm. In some studies, lifetime exposure was calculated using company records and questionnaire data. The current exposure to noise was estimated by noise dosimetry or standard noise measurements. Lifetime noise exposure was assessed using questionnaire data and occupational noise estimates. In many studies, noise-exposed groups were used as controls together with the unexposed workers. Of the nine studies, seven show some effects on the auditory system that were associated with styrene-alone exposure. These effects are examined using different outcome measures such as pure tone audiometry, high frequency hearing loss, and central hearing tests. In some studies, an increased risk for hearing loss was associated with exposure estimates."
"20024522","Occupation and the risk of hearing impairment--results from the Nord-Trøndelag study on hearing loss.","OBJECTIVES: We studied the effect of occupation on hearing and if it remained after adjustment for noise exposure, education, income, and other risk factors.METHODS: Audiometry and a questionnaire concerning exposure was administered to a general adult population sample in Norway (N=49,948). Information on occupation, education, and income was obtained from population census registers.RESULTS: Occupation had marked effects on hearing loss. Occupation explained 2-3% of the variance in hearing loss among men &gt; or =45 years in addition to the hearing loss due to age (10-19%). Occupation explained &lt; or =1% of hearing loss among women of all ages and young men. Controlling for self-reported occupational noise exposure reduced the occupational effect by 20-40% in men &gt; or =45 years. Controlling for leisure-time noise, ear infections, and head injuries did not change the effect of occupation, which was slightly reduced after controlling for education and income. The most elevated hearing thresholds in men were observed among: wood workers; miners; linemen and cable jointers; construction carpenters and workers; seamen; and workshop mechanics.CONCLUSIONS: There was a moderate association between occupation and hearing loss. Unbiased estimates of occupational hearing loss may help identify high-risk occupations, for which interventions are needed, and identify individuals with hearing loss."

DNA samples were collected from the 10% most susceptible and the 10% most resistant individuals. Four SNPs in the introns of SOD1 were genotyped and their effects and interactions with noise exposure were analyzed.RESULTS: Genotype AA of rs2070424 conferred protection against NIHL (adjusted OR = 0.45, p = 0.005), while GG of rs10432782 was a risk genotype (adjusted OR = 1.88, p = 0.026).

Significant interactions between SOD1 SNPs and noise levels were found. Further analysis of effects of SOD1 SNPs found that those carrying GG genotype of rs10432782 had significantly higher SOD1 activity (p = 0.022), but a significantly lower level of malondialdehyde in plasma, compared with TT carriers (p = 0.007)."

"19786896","Peripheral and central auditory dysfunction induced by occupational exposure to organic solvents.","OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of solvent exposure on hearing function, through an audiological test battery, in a population not occupationally exposed to high levels of noise.METHODS: One hundred ten workers from a coating factory were studied. Jobs at the factory were divided into three different levels of solvent exposure. Hearing status was assessed with a test battery including pure-tone hearing thresholds (0.5-8 kHz), high-frequency hearing thresholds (12 and 16 kHz), and dichotic listening measured through dichotic digits test. Multiple linear regression models were created to explore possible association between solvent exposure and each of the hearing outcomes.RESULTS: Significant associations between solvent exposure and the three hearing outcomes were found. Covariates such as age, gender, race, and ethnicity were also significantly associated with the studied hearing outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: Occupational exposure to solvents may induce both peripheral and central auditory dysfunction. The dichotic digits test seems as a sensible tool to detect central auditory dysfunction associated with solvent exposure. Hearing loss prevention programs may use this tool to monitor hearing in solvent-exposed workers."
"19766602","Follow-up of latency and threshold shifts of auditory brainstem responses after single and interrupted acoustic trauma in guinea pig.","Thresholds of auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) are widely used to estimate the level of noise-induced hearing loss or the level of acquired resistance to acoustic trauma after repeated exposures, i.e., the &quot;toughening&quot; effect. Less is known about ABR latencies and their relation to threshold changes. Guinea pigs were exposed to a traumatic pure tone at 5 kHz, 120 dB SPL, as either single (2 h, 4 h) or repeated (1 h every 48 h, four times) sessions. Thresholds and latencies of ABRs were monitored up to 45 days following the acoustic trauma. We show that latencies are prolonged in the case of large temporary threshold shifts observed in the days following trauma. The latency shift decreases after several repeated exposures, then stabilizes, similar to thresholds, suggesting that the &quot;toughening&quot; effect also applies to latencies. Permanent latency shift is usually very small compared to the permanent threshold shift. This effect could produce a recovery in the ability to process auditory information through the precise timing of neuronal events. Our study indicates that when estimated at suprathreshold stimulation level (70 dB SPL), latency provides complementary information to the sole threshold."

Based on the average of the frequencies 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz, approximately 1% of the general UK population aged 18-80 years have an asymmetry of 15 dB or more. The prevalence is greater in older than in younger people.CONCLUSIONS: Inter-aural threshold differences greater than attributable to measurement error are not uncommon in the adult population, even after screening for conductive hearing loss and substantial noise exposure. They are typically of unknown origin."

Glutathione is an important cellular antioxidant that limits cell damage by ROS. We aimed to determine the effect of genetic polymorphisms of glutathione S-transferase (GST) T1, GSTM1, and GSTP1, on temporary threshold shift (TTS) in 58 noise-exposed male workers from a steel factory. The pre-shift hearing impairment at high frequency (HF, average of 3, 4, and 6kHz) was 30.7dB HL (S.D.=19.3). The amount of daily noise exposure was 83.0dBA (S.D.=5.0). Noise-induced TTS at HF by pure-tone audiometry (PTA) was related to the daily noise exposure (p&lt;0.05). Based on combinatory analysis, we found that individuals carrying all genotypes with GSTT1 null, GSTM1 null, and GSTP1 Ile(105)/Ile(105) were more susceptible to NIHL. These results suggest that pre-shift hearing impairment and daily noise exposure had impacts on TTS at HF by PTA. In addition, GST genetic polymorphisms may modify the susceptibility to noise-induced TTS."
"19633561","Notched audiograms and noise exposure history in older adults.","OBJECTIVE: Using data from a population-based cohort study, we compared four published algorithms for identifying notched audiograms and compared their resulting classifications with noise exposure history.DESIGN: Four algorithms: (1) , (2) , (3) , and (4) were used to identify notched audiograms. Audiometric evaluations were collected as a part of the 10-yr follow-up examinations of the Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study, in Beaver Dam, WI (2003-2005, N = 2395). Detailed noise exposure histories were collected by interview at the baseline examination (1993-1995) and updated at subsequent visits. An extensive history of occupational noise exposure, participation in noisy hobbies, and firearm usage was used to evaluate consistency of the notch classifications with the history of noise exposure.RESULTS: The prevalence of notched audiograms varied greatly by definition (31.7, 25.9, 47.2, and 11.7% for methods 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). In this cohort, a history of noise exposure was common (56.2% for occupational noise, 71.7% for noisy hobbies, 13.4% for firearms, and 81.2% for any of these three sources). Among participants with a notched audiogram, almost one-third did not have a history of occupational noise exposure (31.4, 33.0, 32.5, and 28.1% for methods 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively), and approximately 11% did not have a history of exposure to any of the three sources of noise (11.5, 13.6, 10.3, and 7.6%). Discordance was greater in women than in men.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that there is a poor agreement across existing algorithms for audiometric notches. In addition, notches can occur in the absence of a positive noise history. In the absence of an objective consensus definition of a notched audiogram and in light of the degree of discordance in women between noise history and notches by each of these algorithms, researchers should be cautious about classifying noise-induced hearing loss by notched audiograms."

Ten male divers with normal hearing were exposed to active sonar of the Italian Navy for more than 100 exposures, each of at least 1-h duration, in the course of 6 months. Before, at the end, and six months after the end of noise exposure, we performed pure-tone audiometry, Carhart test, Peyser test, thresholds of discomfort test (TDT), tympanometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), and auditory brainstem response (ABR). At the end of the noise exposure, the audiological tests showed a worsening of the mean air and bone audiometric thresholds at the 2,000 (1/10), 4,000 (7/10), and 8,000 Hz (6/10); a fail status of the TEOAE and DPOAE, which were previously present, in all the divers; temporary threshold shift, at the Peyser test, in 9/10 divers; discomfort for pulse tone presented at the TDT test, in all the divers; no post exposure significant differences at the Carhart and ABR tests, in any of the divers. Six months after the end of noise exposure, all the divers presented a complete recovery of their audio-vestibular functions. Our results show the temporary negative effects of repeated and lasting exposure to active sonar (Hull MF) on the divers; the last control demonstrate the absence of permanent noise-induced hearing loss in divers exposed to active sonar."

Test results were categorized as defined by Merluzzi. Individuals complaining of tinnitus answered the adapted and validated Brazilian Portuguese version of the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory. A generalized linear model was adjusted for binomial data to test the interaction between these factors.RESULTS: Over 60% of the ears analyzed had hearing loss, while more than 46% of them had tinnitus. Tinnitus prevalence and risk rates increased as pure tone audiometry results got worse. The association between both, considering all hearing loss degrees, was statistically significant.CONCLUSION: The results point to a statistical association between hearing loss and tinnitus; the greater the hearing loss, the greater the discomfort introduced by tinnitus."

"19344615","Exploiting otoacoustic emission testing to identify clinical and subclinical inner ear barotrauma in divers: potential risk factor for sensorineural hearing loss.","INTRODUCTION: Divers may sustain subclinical inner ear barotrauma (IEBT) that is not identified on pure-tone audiometry (PTA) but is potentially an important contributor to chronic sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Otoacoustic emission (OAE) testing, which identifies transient emission shifts (TESs) stemming from noise-induced inner ear injury, may be a more sensitive measure than PTA. Recognizing the salubrious health implications in mitigating the incidence and severity of SNHL in divers with earlier detection, we performed a pilot study investigating the potential of OAEs to identify clinical and subclinical IEBT (defined as a TES without an accompanying transient threshold shift) in divers subject to a provocative repetitive diving protocol.METHODS: Eight US Navy-trained male divers participated in a repetitive diving protocol encompassing up to a maximum of 10 weeks of diving. All subjects received an otoscopic examination, tympanometry, and OAE testing on both ears prior to and immediately after each dive. Audiometry was evaluated prior to and after each week of repetitive diving.RESULTS: There were 212 data pairs for comparison in the OAE testing. The average group wideband transient-evoked OAE shift was -1.24 dB. Only 25 significant threshold shifts were identified in over 1000 comparisons via audiometry.CONCLUSIONS: OAE testing identified significant TES in a provocative repetitive diving protocol, supporting the assertion that both clinical and subclinical IEBT may contribute to chronic SNHL in divers. Exploiting this technology as an integral component of diving medical surveillance may identify those at risk for subsequent IEBT and hearing loss, facilitating opportunities for interventions to mitigate its severity or circumvent its development."

The drivers were interviewed and underwent clinical and laboratory examinations including measurement of blood pressure, anthropometric data, and pure-tone audiometry in a sound-treated booths. The mean (SD) age of the participants was 40.8 (11.0) years with a mean (SD) duration of professional driving of 14.7 (9.6) years.RESULTS: The prevalence of bilateral noise-induced hearing loss was 18.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 17.0~19.3]. The prevalence rates were higher in the left ear only 6.5% (95% CI: 5.8~7.3) than the right ear only 3.0 percent; (95% CI: 2.5~3.9). Using a stepwise binary logistic regression model for the right and left ear only and for both ears separately, age was a significant independent predictor of bilateral noise-induced hearing loss and for the left or right ear only. When bilateral noise-induced hearing loss was entered in the model, fasting blood glucose was a significant predictor of noise-induced hearing loss. Blood pressure, cholesterol, triglyceride, body mass index, and marital status had no significant independent association with noise-induced hearing loss when other covariates were considered.CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that noise-induced hearing loss among the long-distance drivers appears to be similar to the world's population endures noise-induced hearing loss caused by occupational exposure to noise, with higher prevalence in the left ear only."

At pre-test, audiometric thresholds for all ears were &lt;or=25 dB HL from 0.5 to 3 kHz and &lt;or=30 dB HL at 4 kHz. Ears with low-level or absent OAEs at pre-test were more likely to be classified with significant threshold shifts (STSs) at post-test. A subgroup of 60 noise-exposed volunteers with complete data sets for both ears showed significant decreases in OAE amplitude but no change in audiometric thresholds. STSs and significant emission shifts (SESs) between 2 and 4 kHz in individual ears were identified using criteria based on the standard error of measurement from the control group. There was essentially no association between the occurrence of STS and SES. There were more SESs than STSs, and the group of SES ears had more STS ears than the group of no-SES ears. The increased sensitivity of OAEs in comparison to audiometric thresholds was shown in all analyses, and low-level OAEs indicate an increased risk of future hearing loss by as much as ninefold."

"21302411","Prevention of acute acoustic trauma by earmuffs during military training.","BACKGROUND: Impulse noise produced from firearms can potentially damage hearing organs resulting in sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). In Chiang Mai during 1997, Detphithak et al reported a prevalence of acute acoustic trauma (AAT) in 22% of new military privates using an H.K.33 for shooting practice without hearing protection. The H.K.33 renders an average sound pressure level of 128 dBA. Earmuffs are claimed by their manufacturing company to attenuate noise 27 dB, and they have been recently introduced in Chiang Mai to prevent AAT.OBJECTIVE: To study the outcomes of hearing protection against AAT using earmuffs during shooting training (H.K.33) in the Military Reserve Officer Training Corps (MROTC).MATERIAL AND METHOD: A quasi - experiment study was conducted among 267 normal hearing MROTCs in the Reserve Officers Student Training Center (ROSTC) of the 33rd Military Circle, Chiang Mai, Thailand. Their condition of hearing was examined by an otolaryngologist and an audiologist using pure tone audiometry (PTA) before shooting practice, within 2 hours after the practice, 3 days after the practice at the ROSTC; and 1 month later at Fort Kawila Hospital, Chiang Mai, Thailand.RESULTS: All 267 MROTCs used earmuffs during shooting practice. Their mean age was 17.95 years. Average sound pressure level of an HK.33 was 127 dBA (range; 126.5-130 dBA). AAT was found in 4 persons (1.5%) within two hours after shooting. Repeat testing 3 days later revealed that only one person (0.37%) still had SNHL. Fortunately, this case reached complete recovery within 1 month. When comparing these findings with those of 1997, earmuffs can reduce AAT by 15 times (95% confidence interval 5.3-40.5, p-value &lt; 0.0001) to a negligible level.CONCLUSION: Shooting training with an H.K. 33 produces a dangerous sound pressure level at the shooting site, resulting in a possible high risk of acute acoustic trauma. Earmuffs can effectively reduce this risk by approximately 15 times, and they should be widely used in all shooting training."

"21059594","Use of historical data and a novel metric in the evaluation of the effectiveness of hearing conservation program components.","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of hearing conservation programs (HCP) and their specific components in reducing noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at one food-processing plant and two automotive plants. Audiometric and work-history databases were combined with historical noise monitoring data to develop a time-dependent exposure matrix for each plant. Historical changes in production and HCP implementation were collected from company records, employee interviews and focus groups. These data were used to develop time-dependent quality assessments for various HCP components. 5478 male (30,427 observations) and 1005 female (5816 observations) subjects were included in the analysis.RESULTS: Analyses were conducted separately for males and females. Females tended to have less NIHL at given exposure levels than males. Duration of noise exposure stratified by intensity (dBA) was a better predictor of NIHL than the standard equivalent continuous noise level (L(eq)) based upon a 3-dBA exchange. Within this cohort, efficient dBA strata for males were &lt;95 versus = 95, and for females &lt;90 versus = 90. The reported enforced use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) significantly reduced NIHL. The data did not have sufficient within-plant variation to determine the effectiveness of noise monitoring or worker training. An association between increased audiometric testing and NIHL was believed to be an artifact of increased participation in screening.CONCLUSIONS: Historical audiometric data combined with noise monitoring data can be used to better understand the effectiveness of HCPs. Regular collection and maintenance of quality data should be encouraged and used to monitor the effectiveness of these interventions."

After audiological evaluation (pure tone audiometry, middle ear analysis, TEOAE and DPOAE) hearing protective devices were provided to be used for three months. After that musicians answered a satisfaction assessment questionnaire.RESULTS: The prevalence of hearing loss was of 21.7%. The most common complaints about the hearing protectors were: autophonia, pressure in the ears, interference in high frequencies perception and full time use of the hearing protector during concerts. There was a positive correlation between a reduction in tinnitus after the use of the HPD with the following complaints: tinnitus after beginning the career (p= 0.044), discomfort with the sound intensity in the work place (p= 0.009) and intolerance to loud sound (p= 0.029).CONCLUSIONS: There was a high prevalence of hearing loss and a positive tendency towards the use of the ear protector device among the sample population."

"20828512","Predicting hearing thresholds and occupational hearing loss with multiple-frequency auditory steady-state responses.","OBJECTIVE: An objective investigation is needed to verify the existence and severity of hearing impairments resulting from work-related, noise-induced hearing loss in arbitration of medicolegal aspects. We investigated the accuracy of multiple-frequency auditory steady-state responses (Mf-ASSRs) between subjects with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) with and without occupational noise exposure.DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.SETTING: Tertiary referral medical centre.METHODS: Pure-tone audiometry and Mf-ASSRs were recorded in 88 subjects (34 patients had occupational noise-induced hearing loss [NIHL], 36 patients had SNHL without noise exposure, and 18 volunteers were normal controls).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Inter- and intragroup comparisons were made. A predicting equation was derived using multiple linear regression analysis.RESULTS: ASSRs and pure-tone thresholds (PTTs) showed a strong correlation for all subjects (r = .77  .94). The relationship is demonstrated by the equationThe differences between the ASSR and PTT were significantly higher for the NIHL group than for the subjects with non-noise-induced SNHL (p &lt; .001).CONCLUSIONS: Mf-ASSR is a promising tool for objectively evaluating hearing thresholds. Predictive value may be lower in subjects with occupational hearing loss. Regardless of carrier frequencies, the severity of hearing loss affects the steady-state response. Moreover, the ASSR may assist in detecting noise-induced injury of the auditory pathway. A multiple linear regression equation to accurately predict thresholds was shown that takes into consideration all effect factors."
"20689029","Listening habits of iPod users.","PURPOSE: To estimate real-environment iPod listening levels for listeners in 4 environments to gain insight into whether average listeners receive dosages exceeding occupational noise exposure guidelines as a result of their listening habits.METHOD: The earbud outputs of iPods were connected directly into the inputs of a digital recorder to make recordings of listening levels. These recordings were used to estimate listening levels using reference recordings made in a real ear. Recordings were made in 4 environments with a wide range of background noises: (a) a library, (b) a student center, (c) busy streets, and (d) the subway.RESULTS: None of the 64 listeners were estimated to exceed allowable occupational dosages, with a maximum dose of 7.57% based on Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA; 1998) methods and 10.83% based on National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH; 1998) methods.CONCLUSIONS: All of the listeners surveyed were exposed to dosages well below OSHA and NIOSH occupational regulations. Although this does not guarantee individual safety, the results do not support the widespread concern regarding the safety of common iPod usage. However, measurements made in this study agree with the finding that iPod output can exceed safe levels and further support recommendations to monitor and limit listening volume and listening duration."
"20603576","Vestibular evoked myogenic potential in noise-induced hearing loss.","Noise affects one's hearing as well as balance mechanism. The hearing mechanism of the noise-exposed individuals has been extensively studied. However, in view of the poor research focus on the sacculo-collic reflexes, especially in this study area, the present study was undertaken to examine the vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP) in subjects with noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). A total of 30 subjects (55 ears) with NIHL participated in the present study within the age range of 30-40 years. VEMP recordings were done at 99 dBnHL using IHS instrument. The results indicated that as the average pure tone hearing threshold increased, the VEMP latencies were prolonged and peak to peak amplitude was reduced in NIHL subjects. Out of the 55 ears, VEMP was absent in 16 (29.0%) ears. The latency was prolonged and the peak to peak amplitude was reduced in 19 (34.6%) ears. VEMP results were normal in 20 (36.4%) ears. Therefore, VEMP was abnormal or absent in 67% of NIHL subjects in the present study. Hence it can be concluded that the possibility of vestibular dysfunction, specially the saccular pathway, is high in individuals with NIHL. VEMP, a non-invasive and user friendly procedure, can be employed in these individuals to assess sacculo-collic reflex."

We calculated percentage loss of hearing (PLH) and used regression models to examine whether there was an association between PLH and F-111 fuel tank maintenance, adjusting for possible confounders. In addition, the difference between the observed hearing thresholds and the expected thresholds based on an otologically normal population (ISO-7029-2003) was determined.RESULTS: The PLH ranged from nil to 96 (median 1.5, quartiles 0.3, 5.5). A logistic regression model showed no statistically significant difference in PLH among the three exposure groups (exposed vs. non-technical controls 1.1: 95% CI 0.7, 2.0 and exposed vs. technical OR 0.9: 95% CI 0.6, 1.3). The model also highlighted a number of other risk factors for PLH including age, tinnitus, smoking, depression, and use of depression medications. However, at all eight frequencies measured, all populations had lower than expected hearing thresholds based on published ISO-7029 medians.CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no difference in PLH between the three exposure groups, the study did reveal a high degree of hearing loss between the 3 groups and a normal population."
"20584863","Temporary threshold shifts at 1500 and 2000 Hz induced by loud voice signals communicated through earphones in the pinball industry.","To assess the risk of hearing loss among workers using earphones as communication devices at noisy worksites, we compared temporary threshold shifts (TTS) between ears on which workers wore earphones and ears on which no earphones were worn. We measured ambient noise and personal noise exposure as well as noise generated by and passed through earphones by applying frequency analysis at three pinball facilities during their hours of actual operation. We assessed hearing levels before and after a work shift (prework and postwork) of 54 workers by pure tone audiometry at six frequencies. The time-weighted averages for ambient noise and personal noise exposure exceeded 85 dB(A) and 90 dB(A), respectively. Overall sound pressure levels generated by and passing through earphones reached 109 dB(A). The one-third octave band spectrum of the earphone noise during the shift exceeded 90 dB(SPL) in the range of 315-2000 Hz. The number of ears demonstrating a TTS, defined as a shift of 10 dB or more in postwork over prework hearing thresholds, was significantly greater at 1500 and 2000 Hz among ears with earphones (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively) compared to those without. The reverse was observed at 4000 Hz for ears without earphones (P &lt; 0.01). Workers wearing earphones or headsets as communication devices in noisy environments are exposed to high risk of hearing loss, particularly at the frequencies of 1500 and 2000 Hz. Ideally, hearing conservation programs for such workers should account for potential hearing losses at frequencies of 2000 Hz or lower frequencies induced by amplified voice signals."
"20516680","The Annex C fallacy: why unscreened databases are usually preferable for comparison of industrially exposed groups.","One can study occupational noise exposure by comparing hearing thresholds of exposed people to control data from national or international standards. ANSI S3.44 (1996) offers Annex C--thresholds for people without occupational noise exposure--as appropriate control data for such comparisons. Annex C is based on the false assumption that people who have had occupational noise exposure are similar in all other important ways to those without such exposures. In fact, people with noisy jobs are more likely than others to be smokers, diabetics, poorly educated, white and exposed to non-occupational noise. Taking these other risk factors into account, the appropriate thresholds for comparison to industrial study populations are closer to those of the unscreened population than to an 'Annex C' population that simply excludes occupationally noise-exposed persons."
"20430548","The impact of arterial sclerosis on hearing with and without occupational noise exposure: a population-based aging study in males.","OBJECTIVES: Arterial sclerosis contributes to inadequate blood supply to multiple organs, suggesting that general atherosclerosis may play an important role in the inner ear. Since noise is a major etiology for hearing loss, the aim of this study was to evaluate both the respective and the combined effects of arterial sclerosis and occupational noise exposure on hearing after accounting for age in middle-aged and elderly men.METHODS: The evaluation was conducted using 773 subjects from a population-based sample of 1189 men, aged 40-83 years. The impact of carotid atherosclerosis (CA) or retinal arteriolosclerosis (RA) on hearing was assessed according to history of occupational noise exposure (Noise) obtained in a questionnaire. Differences in the mean pure-tone thresholds at each frequency, between the CA (+) and CA (-) groups or between the RA (+) and RA (-) groups, based on noise exposure were compared using the general linear model (GLM) Procedure in SAS, with adjustments for age. Then, the main effect of CA or RA, and the interactive effect of noise and either CA or RA on pure-tone threshold at seven frequencies were analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), after adjusting for age.RESULTS: In the Noise (+) group, a statistically significant deterioration in hearing was found in the CA (+) group compared with the CA (-) group at 500 and 1000 Hz. The results in RA were significant at even lower frequencies than in CA. In the results from ANCOVA, the significant main effect of CA was shown in the pure-tone threshold at 8000 Hz, but not in the analysis of RA. A significant interactive effect of either CA or RA and Noise was observed in hearing at the range from 125 to 1000 Hz.CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that the impact of arterial sclerosis on hearing is limited but significantly hazardous in middle-aged and elderly men, and that arterial sclerosis exacerbates the deleterious effects of noise on hearing. Early recognition of arterial sclerosis might be contributory to the hearing prognosis after middle age, especially for noise-exposed men."

"20233141","Prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss in student musicians.","This study describes the prevalence and characteristics of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in student musicians (N = 329) aged 18-25 years. Students completed a questionnaire regarding exposures before a hearing assessment. NIHL was defined by the presence of a notch 15 dB in depth at 4000 or 6000 Hz relative to the best preceding threshold. Overall prevalence of NIHL was 45%, with 78% of notches occurring at 6000 Hz. The proportion of the total population with bilateral notching at any frequency was 11.5%, mostly occurring at 6000 Hz. There was a significant increase in the frequency of notching in students who reported more than two hours per day of personal practice. There were no significant associations for instrument group or other noise exposures. The data suggest that susceptibility to NIHL among students of music is not uniform and cannot be ascribed solely to the instrument played and other exposures. Students with bilateral losses tend to have deeper notches and may represent a group that has an inherent predisposition to NIHL."
"20192875","Otoacoustic emissions in a hearing conservation program: general applicability in longitudinal monitoring and the relation to changes in pure-tone thresholds.","The hearing status of workers (N = 233) in a printing office was assessed twice within seventeen months by pure-tone audiometry and otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). One of the questions was how a quality criterion of OAE-measurements based on a minimum signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) would affect the applicability on the entire population. Secondly, effects of noise exposure were investigated in overall changes in audiogram and OAE-measurements. For TEOAEs (transient evoked OAEs) in the frequency band of 4 kHz, only 55% of the data points meet the SNR-inclusion criterion. For DPOAEs (distortion product OAEs) around 6 kHz approximately 80% of the data points satisfy the criterion. Thus OAEs have a limited applicability for monitoring the hearing status of this entire population. Audiometry shows significant deteriorations at 6 and 8 kHz. TEOAEs show a significant decline at all frequency bands (1-4 kHz), DPOAEs between 4 and 8 kHz and less pronounced between 1 and 2 kHz. On group level, OAEs show a decline in a larger frequency region than the audiogram, suggesting an increased sensitivity of OAEs compared to audiometry."

The sample was made up of 214 teenagers from a high-school in Mexico City; subjects were selected randomly per strata. We applied a questionnaire to identify risk factors for hearing loss and performed a battery of audiologic tests consisting of otoscopy, tympanometry, and pure-tone audiometry. The mean age of the sample was 16 +/- 1.07 years; 73% were male and 27%, female. Hearing loss was found in 21% of students. The main hearing loss-related risk factor was exposure to recreational noise: frequent attendance at discotheques and pop-music concerts; use of personal stereos; and noise exposure in school workshops. The high frequency of hearing loss in high school students from one Mexico City school (nearly one fifth of the sample) was found to be related to noise exposure mainly during recreational activities."

This study was performed to compare the results of audiogram and the newer diagnostic method distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) parameters due to acoustic shock injury in call center professionals working in a noisy environment and prone to acoustic injury.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hearing functions of 340 subjects were first assessed with pure tone audiometry and then DPOAEs results were compared among acoustic shock exposed subjects with normal audiogram and those with abnormal audiogram.RESULTS: Out of 340 acoustic shock exposed subjects 304 were normal on audiometric testing and 34 had abnormal audiograms. Subsequently on DPOAE testing out of 304 acoustic shock exposed subjects with normal audiogram 125 failed and 181 passed.CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that DPOAEs are more sensitive than audiometry to detect pre-symptomatic inner ear damage. It may play a role as screening and monitoring test for acoustic shock-exposed workers."
"20160390","Noise induced hearing loss risk assessment in truck drivers.","Hearing sense is one of the key elements which may have impact on the driver's task quality. This cross-sectional study investigates the hearing status of 500 truck drivers by pure tone audiometry (AC) in one of the cities in Fars province, Iran. Hearing threshold levels of the subjects were measured in frequencies of 500Hz-8000Hz. Screening and determination of permanent threshold shift (PTS) was the first aim of this study. Hence tests were done at least 16 hours after any exposure to noticeable sound. The effect of age as a confounding factor was considered using ISO equation and subtracted from whole hearing threshold. The threshold of 25 dB HL and above was considered abnormal but the calculation of hearing was also carried out using 0 dB HL as reference. Subjects were categorized into two groups on the basis of working experience and the hearing threshold of 25 dB was considered a boundary of normal hearing sense. The results of Pearson Chi-Square test showed that working experience as an independent variable has significant contributing effect on hearing thresholds of truck drivers in frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz (p greater than 0.05). Also, it was shown that currently nine and 12.6 % of truck drivers suffer from impaired hearing sense in left and right respectively (hearing threshold level greater than 25 dB) in mid frequencies (500, 1000, 2000 Hz) and 45% in high frequencies of both ears (4000 and 8000 Hz). The results indicated that hearing damage of professional drivers was expected to occur sooner at 4000 and 8000 Hz than lower frequencies. Finally it was deduced that the occupational conditions of truck drivers may have bilateral, symmetrical harmful effect on hearing threshold sense in all frequencies mainly in frequency of 4000 Hz, so health surveillance programs such as education and periodic medical examinations are emphasized for pre-diagnosing and prevention of any possible impairment and an urgent need to take up some interventions such as better maintenance of roads, automobile industry efforts to reduce the noise level emission of vehicles and reducing number of working hours per day of drivers are highlighted to improve the harmful working conditions of truck drivers."

We conducted personal interviews of 350 male workers of these units through a comprehensive questionnaire and collected information on heat and noise exposure, use of protective equipment, sweat loss and water intake, working hour. The ambient wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT index) was measured using quest temp 34/36o area heat stress monitor. A-weighted Leq ambient noise was measured using a quest sound level meter &quot;ANSI SI. 43-1997 (R 2002) type-1 model SOUNDPRO SE/DL&quot;. We also incorporated OSHA norms for hearing conservation which include - an exchange rate of 5dB(A), criterion level at 90dB(A), criterion time of eight hours, threshold level is equal to 80dB(A), upper limit is equal to 140dB(A) and with F/S response rate. Results of the study revealed that occupational heat exposure in melting, casting, forging and punching sections is high compared to ACGIH/NIOSH norms. Ambience noise in various sections like casting / molding, drop forging, cutting presses, punching, grinding and barreling process was found to be more than 90dB(A). About 95% of the workers suffered speech interference where as high noise annoyance was reported by only 20%. Overall, 68% workers were not using any personal protective equipment (PPE). The study concluded that the proportion of SME workers exposed to high level heat stress and noise (60 - 72 hrs/week) is high. The workers engaged in forging and grinding sections are more prone to noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) at higher frequencies as compared to workers of other sections. It is recommended that there is a strong need to implement the standard of working hours as well as heat stress and noise control measures."
"20151883","High frequency audiometric notch: an outpatient clinic survey.","It is a common misconception that high frequency audiometric notches are diagnostic of noise induced hearing loss. The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of high frequency notch (HFN) in an audiovestibular medicine outpatient clinic population at a district general hospital. One hundred and forty nine consecutive adult patients were assessed. According to standard practice at the audiovestibular clinic, a full clinical history with particular emphasis on neuro-otological symptoms, noise exposure, and medical risk factors for sensorineural hearing loss was taken. After standard 8-frequency pure tone audiometry, subjects were divided into those with HFN and those without. There were 84 (56%) females and 65 (44%) males with a mean age of 45 years (range: 19 to 91 years). A total of 39.6% had notches not attributable to noise (occupational or recreational) or any other known risk factor. In 29 (49.2%) and 15 (25.4%) the HFN was present in the left and right ear respectively whereas 15 (25.4%) were bilateral. The frequency least affected was 3 kHz while 4 kHz and 6 kHz were affected in almost equal proportions. In 53 ears (71.6%), the notch depth was less than 20 dBHL (10-19 dB) compared to 21 ears (28.4%) with a depth of 20 dBHL or more. This study concludes that high frequency notch without excessive noise exposure or any other known factor is common. It is neither diagnostic of, nor invariable with NIHL unless a convincing history of hazardous noise exposure is elicited from the history."

The impact will be demonstrated using a case example. The reasons for incorrect assessment are often insufficient examination conditions or simulation and aggression of the subject. The results of a study on this topic will be presented.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 61 patients who underwent a psycho-acoustic medical assessment were grouped into 1 of 4 categories ranging from category 0 for no simulation or aggravation to category III for severe simulation and aggravation. For category III reliable and valid thresholds of pure tone audiometry can only be achieved using objective audiological measurements. The frequency, extent and socio-economic factors were evaluated.RESULTS: Of the 61 individuals 26 showed no simulation or aggravation behavior (category 0), 10% were grouped into category III and 48% into categories I and II. The tendency to simulation and aggravation increased with the patients' age, the level of education and the frequency of medical examinations prior to this investigation.CONCLUSIONS: Simulation and aggravation is a more frequent phenomenon than previously assumed (approximately 58% of all audiological examinations). The effect in terms of economical damage could be substantial. The usage of a well-defined classification is highly recommended in order to improve the quality of medical assessment in ENT."

Noise-induced hearing losses have become more common among adolescents due to increased exposure to personal music players. We, therefore, investigated the use of personal music player among Korean adolescents and the relationship between hearing threshold and usage pattern of portable music players.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 490 adolescents were interviewed personally regarding their use of portable music players, including the time and type of player and the type of headphone used. Pure tone audiometry was performed in each subject.RESULTS: Of the 490 subjects, 462 (94.3%) used personal music players and most of them have used the personal music player for 1-3 hours per day during 1-3 years. The most common type of portable music player was the MP3 player, and the most common type of headphone was the earphone (insert type). Significant elevations of hearing threshold were observed in males, in adolescents who had used portable music players for over 5 years, for those over 15 years in cumulative period and in those who had used earphones.CONCLUSION: Portable music players can have a deleterious effect on hearing threshold in adolescents. To preserve hearing, adolescents should avoid using portable music players for long periods of time and should avoid using earphones."

A single audiologist reviewed the results. Students completed a survey assessing their noise exposures.SETTING: A public high school in Pennsylvania.PARTICIPANTS: Eleventh-grade students.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Notched audiometric configurations on the pure-tone threshold test.RESULTS: Among 296 participants, 78 (26.4%) failed pure-tone threshold testing compared with 15 (5.1%) failing rapid hearing screening. Among those failing the pure-tone threshold testing, 67 (85.9%) failed due to notched audiometric configurations. Self-reported headphone use with an MP3 player was significantly associated with notched audiometric configurations compared with use of earbuds or stereo connection/docking systems.CONCLUSIONS: Pure-tone threshold testing incorporating high frequencies detects adolescent hearing loss more often than rapid hearing screens. Most state hearing screens omit high-frequency testing, potentially missing high-frequency losses, such as noise-induced hearing loss. Because noise-induced hearing loss in particular is preventable and hazardous noise exposures have increased, a reliable school hearing screen to detect high-frequency hearing loss in adolescents is warranted."

"22122960","Increased vitamin plasma levels in Swedish military personnel treated with nutrients prior to automatic weapon training.","Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a significant clinical, social, and economic issue. The development of novel therapeutic agents to reduce NIHL will potentially benefit multiple very large noise-exposed populations. Oxidative stress has been identified as a significant contributor to noise-induced sensory cell death and NIHL, and several antioxidant strategies have now been suggested for potential translation to human subjects. One such strategy is a combination of beta-carotene, vitamins C and E, and magnesium, which has shown promise for protection against NIHL in rodent models, and is being evaluated in a series of international human clinical trials using temporary (military gunfire, audio player use) and permanent (stamping factory, military airbase) threshold shift models (NCT00808470). The noise exposures used in the recently completed Swedish military gunfire study described in this report did not, on average, result in measurable changes in auditory function using conventional pure-tone thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) amplitudes as metrics. However, analysis of the plasma samples confirmed significant elevations in the bloodstream 2 hours after oral consumption of active clinical supplies, indicating the dose is realistic. The plasma outcomes are encouraging, but clinical acceptance of any novel therapeutic critically depends on demonstration that the agent reduces noise-induced threshold shift in randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective human clinical trials. Although this noise insult did not induce hearing loss, the trial design and study protocol can be applied to other populations exposed to different noise insults."
"22094854","Hearing profile of gold miners with and without tuberculosis.","OBJECTIVES: To compare the hearing of gold miners with and without tuberculosis (TB) to determine the effect of TB and its associated risk profile on hearing.METHODS: Audiological and medical surveillance data of 2698 South African gold miners for 2001-2009 were analysed in a retrospective cohort design. Hearing thresholds for the air conduction frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 kHz) in both ears were analysed together with biographical and occupational data. Subjects were divided into two experimental (single TB treatment, n=911 and multiple TB treatment, n=376) and one control group (n=1411). Comparisons between groups included (1) change from baseline to most recent audiogram, (2) most recent hearing thresholds and (3) most recent thresholds in a subset of noise exposed and unexposed groups.RESULTS: Hearing thresholds for the TB groups were significantly (p&lt;0.01) elevated compared to the control group, after correcting for time between baseline and most recent audiogram, threshold at baseline and age at test. Pair-wise comparisons demonstrated the largest threshold differences between the control and multiple TB group. Changes in mean thresholds across TB treatment groups were independent of noise exposure. Hearing thresholds over time also deteriorated significantly more (p&lt;0.01) in workers with TB (single and multiple treatment) than in workers without TB.CONCLUSION: Gold miners with TB, especially with more than one episode of TB, demonstrate significantly poorer hearing thresholds and more pronounced decline in hearing over time independent of noise exposure. The exact cause is likely a complex interaction between TB, including treatment, and its associated risk profile."

"21988504","Speech-in-noise screening tests by internet, part 1: test evaluation for noise-induced hearing loss identification.","OBJECTIVE: In the Netherlands three internet-based self-screening tests have been developed; the National Hearing Test (NHT), Earcheck (EC), and Occupational Earcheck (OEC). These tests are adaptive speech-in-noise tests using either digit triplets or monosyllables, presented in stationary speech-shaped noise. These tests can be highly valuable in increasing the awareness and prevention of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). This study evaluates these online speech-in-noise tests and investigates their potential to detect NIHL.DESIGN: In a multi-centre study the results of the three online screening tests are compared to pure-tone audiometry and to the Dutch sentence SRT test ( Plomp &amp; Mimpen, 1979a ), which is considered the clinical standard.STUDY SAMPLE: In total, 49 normal-hearing listeners and 49 patients with different degrees of NIHL participated.RESULTS: The online tests show good reliability, but there is much overlap in outcomes between normal-hearing listeners and participants with early NIHL. In addition, rather low correlations of the test results with both the Dutch sentence SRT test and pure-tone thresholds are found. These findings result in rather low test sensitivity: 54% (NHT) and 51% (EC), or low specificity: 49% (OEC).CONCLUSIONS: The online screening tests in their current form are unsuitable to be used for early NIHL screening purposes."
"21970351","Speech-in-noise screening tests by internet, part 2: improving test sensitivity for noise-induced hearing loss.","OBJECTIVE: An easily accessible screening test can be valuable in the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The Dutch National Hearing Foundation developed 'Earcheck', an internet-based speech-in-noise test, presenting CVC-words in stationary broadband noise. However, its sensitivity to detect NIHL appeared to be low, 51% ( Leensen et al, 2011 , part 1). The aim of the current study is to examine ways to improve Earcheck's sensitivity for (early) NIHL using different forms of noise filtering.DESIGN: The test's stationary broadband masking noise is replaced by six alternatives, including noises that have been temporally modulated, spectrally filtered by high-pass or low-pass filters, and combinations of temporal modulation and spectral filtering.STUDY SAMPLE: In this multi-centre study, 49 normal-hearing and 49 subjects with different degrees of NIHL participated.RESULTS: Hearing-impaired subjects deviated more clearly from normal performance when executing the test with alternative masking noises, except for the high-pass filtered conditions. Earcheck with low-pass filtered noise made the best distinction between normal hearing and NIHL, without reducing test reliability. The use of this noise condition improved the sensitivity of Earcheck to 95%.CONCLUSION: The use of low-pass filtered masking noise makes speech-in-noise tests more sensitive to detect NIHL in an early stage."
"21959115","Hearing impairment among workers exposed to excessive levels of noise in ginning industries.","Cotton ginning workers have a risk of hearing loss due to excessive noise levels at the workplace environment. In this study, estimates of typical sound levels prevailing at the workplace environment and its effects on hearing ability of the exposed workers were made among cotton ginning workers. Data on self-reported health status was collected by a questionnaire survey at 10 cotton ginning industries located at Jalgaon district of Maharashtra state, India. The cotton ginning workers were exposed to continuous noise levels between 89 and 106 dBA. The hearing ability of the subjects was accessed by pure tone audiometry. The results of audiometry show mild, moderate and moderately severe degree of hearing impairment among the cotton ginning workers. The data generated during the study show that hearing loss was significantly associated with period of exposure to the workplace noise (P &lt;0.0001). The prevalence of audiometric hearing impairment defined as a threshold average greater than 25 dB hearing level was 96% for binaural low-frequency average, 97% for binaural mid frequency average and 94% for binaural high-frequency average in the cotton ginning workers. We recommend the compulsory use of personal protective equipment like ear plug by the cotton ginning workers at the workplace environment. A regular maintenance of ginning and pressing machineries will avoid the emission of excessive noise at the workplace environment of cotton gins. A regular periodic medical examination is necessary to measure the impact of workplace noise on the health of cotton ginning workers."
"21936701","Clinical characteristics of acoustic trauma caused by gunshot noise in mass rifle drills without ear protection.","One of the major occupational hazards of working in military service is being subjected to intense impulse noise. We analyzed the clinical presentation of acoustic traumas, induced by mass rifle gunshot noise during military training, in unprotected patients. We evaluated 189 soldiers who had otologic symptoms after rifle shooting exercises without using any hearing protection. All soldiers had been training on the K2 rifle. We took medical histories; conducted physical examinations and hearing evaluations (pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry, and impedence audiometry); and distributed the Newmann's Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) survey. In addition, we evaluated a normal control group of 64 subjects of similar age who had never fired a rifle. In the patient group, the most common and irritating reported symptom was tinnitus (94.2%), and the average THI score in the patient group was 39.51 ± 14.87, which was significantly higher than the control group score (0.56 ± 3.94) (p &lt; 0.001). Average outcomes of post-exposure air conduction thresholds were 21.33 ± 13.25 dB HL in the affected ears. These levels also were significantly higher than those of the control group (9.16 ± 4.07dB HL) (p &lt; 0.001). Hearing loss was most prominent at high frequencies. An asymmetry of hearing loss related to head position during shooting was not observed. Acoustic trauma induced by gunshot noise can cause permanent tinnitus and hearing loss. Hearing protection (bilateral earplugs) and environmental reform are necessary."

"21873915","Validity of self-rated hearing compared with audiometric measurement among construction workers.","BACKGROUND: A valid assessment of hearing status is important to detect hearing loss early and prevent further loss in noise-exposed individuals or older adults. Self-report is used widely in research and is often the only possible measure to evaluate hearing ability.OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to establish the level of validity of self-rated hearing by comparing it with the results of audiograms and to examine correlations and changes in self-rated and measured hearing status over time.METHODS: Survey and audiogram data collected from 403 construction workers at two different time points (Years 1 and 2) were used in the hearing protection intervention study. Self-rated hearing was assessed on a 5-point rating scale using a single question (&quot;How do you rate your hearing?&quot;). Hearing was measured via audiograms conducted at frequencies 0.5 through 8 kHz. Three pure-tone threshold average (PTA) indicators, PTA 0.5-2 kHz, PTA 0.5-3 kHz, and PTA 4-6 kHz, of the worse ear were used and compared with self-ratings at two time points.RESULTS: Percentage of agreement between the self-rated and measured hearing was lowest in PTA 4-6 kHz and highest in PTA 0.5-3 kHz for both years. Cohen's kappas showed fair to moderate (.25-.45) agreement. Sensitivity was higher (.82-.89) in the speech frequencies and lower (.51-.55) at higher frequencies. Specificity was better at higher frequencies than at lower frequencies (.83-.89 vs .68-.74). Although there was no appreciable change in self-rated hearing and limited change in measured hearing on all 3 indicators from Years 1 to 2, correlations between self-rated and measured hearing were higher in Year 2.DISCUSSION: A single-item question about an individual's hearing ability is moderately useful and valid to assess hearing loss and can be recommended for a population-based study only if audiograms are not available, but self-report hearing screening should not be considered an adequate substitute for the standardized audiometric test. Providing audiograms and feedback on the results apparently enhanced individuals' ability to judge their hearing status."
"21846812","Development and validation of a screening questionnaire for noise-induced hearing loss.","BACKGROUND: An audiometric health surveillance programme can be perceived to be a relatively costly exercise and employers, especially in developing countries, might therefore be reluctant to undertake this. A questionnaire might be a cheaper alternative.AIMS: To develop a questionnaire to help determine the prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in the vernacular (language) of a developing country and to validate it against an audiometric standard.METHODS: A questionnaire was developed, translated and administered in a face-to-face interview. Otoscopic examination was followed by conventional pure-tone audiometry (at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 kHz) for both ears of each respondent. The questionnaire responses were compared to the audiometric standard.RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty workers from three companies (two printing and one woodworking) participated in this study. The sensitivity of the hearing loss questionnaire in detecting noise-induced hearing loss was 32%, while its specificity was 79%. There was an evidence to suggest good agreement (r = 0.523) between the total number of years worked in noisy jobs and NIHL (P &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The questionnaire developed in this study was found to have an unacceptably low sensitivity for noise-induced hearing loss and therefore cannot be a valid substitute for audiometry. Pure tone industrial audiometry needs to be used more widely than currently in developing countries."
"21822855","Audiological implications of earplugs used for the prevention of aural exostoses.","External auditory canal exostoses may be a preventable disease, so it is surprising that the regular use of water precautions is not greater among surfers. One reason for this is the impairment of hearing whilst wearing earplugs. The objective of this study is to establish the hearing impairment of commonly available earplugs used by surfers. Staff and patients with normal hearing were recruited to have pure tone audiometry performed multiple times, initially with no earplugs, and subsequently with earplugs. Three earplug types were tested which differed in their nature and material (prefabricated elastomer, custom-fitted silicone, and custom-fitted acrylic). Vented and non-vented forms of the earplugs were tested. 30 normal hearing ears were included. Two-tailed paired t-tests comparing hearing thresholds between different earplugs identified that the elastomer earplugs caused the least hearing impairment (p &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference in hearing thresholds between vented and non-vented elastomer earplugs (p = 0.148), but the difference between vented and non-vented forms of other earplugs was statistically significant (silicone p = 0.010, acrylic p = 0.018). Prefabricated ear plugs produce less hearing impairment than other commonly available earplugs. A customised earplug made of hard material causes the greatest impairment of hearing. We therefore recommend that for aquatic sports where hearing is important, a soft prefabricated earplug is preferable."

Specific diagnoses of otological and audiological disorders, which can result in hearing loss, were searched for.DESIGN: A retrospective register study.STUDY SAMPLE: Three age cohorts, 474 70- and 75-year olds (&quot;younger&quot;), and 252 85-year olds (&quot;older&quot;), were studied. Clinical pure tone and speech audiometry was used. Data from medical files were included.RESULTS: Conductive hearing loss was diagnosed in 6.1% of the &quot;younger&quot; elderly persons, and in 10.3% of the &quot;older&quot; ones. Specific diagnoses (chronic otitis media and otosclerosis) were established in about half of the cases. Sensorineural hearing loss, other than age-related hearing loss and noise induced hearing loss, was diagnosed in 3.4 % and 5.2% respectively. Severely impaired speech recognition, possibly reflecting age-related auditory neuropathy, was found in 0.4% in the &quot;younger&quot; group, and in 10% in the &quot;older&quot; group. Bilateral functional deafness was present in 3.2% of the 85-year-old persons, but was not present in the 70-75-year group.CONCLUSION: The incidence of probable age-related auditory neuropathy increases considerably from 70-75 to 85 years. There are marked differences between &quot;younger&quot; and &quot;older&quot; elderly persons regarding hearing loss that severely affects oral communication."

Participants exposed to styrene, alone or with noise, were from reinforced fiberglass products manufacturing plants (n = 862). Comparison groups were comprised of workers noise-exposed (n = 400) or controls (n = 358). Current styrene exposures ranged from 0 to 309 mg/m(3), while mean current noise levels ranged from 70-84 dB(A). Hearing thresholds of styrene-exposed participants were compared with Annexes A and B from ANSI S3.44, 1996.RESULTS: The audiometric thresholds of styrene exposed workers were significantly poorer than those in published standards. Age, gender, and styrene exposure met the significance level criterion in the multiple logistic regression for the binary outcome 'hearing loss' (P = 0.0000). Exposure to noise (&lt;85 dBA p = 0.0001; =85 dB(A) p = 0.0192) interacted significantly with styrene exposure.CONCLUSIONS: Occupational exposure to styrene is a risk factor for hearing loss, and styrene-exposed workers should be included in hearing loss prevention programs."
"21802644","Dichotic multiple-frequency auditory steady-state responses in evaluating the hearing thresholds of occupational noise-exposed workers.","An objective, fast, and reasonably accurate assessment test that allows for easy interpretation of the responses of the hearing thresholds at all frequencies of a conventional audiogram is needed to resolve the medicolegal aspects of an occupational hearing injury. This study evaluated the use of dichotic multiple-frequency auditory steady-state responses (Mf-ASSR) to predict the hearing thresholds in workers exposed to high levels of noise. The study sample included 34 workers with noise-induced hearing impairment. Thresholds of pure-tone audiometry (PTA) and Mf-ASSRs at four frequencies were assessed. The differences and correlations between the thresholds of Mf-ASSRs and PTA were determined. The results showed that, on average, Mf-ASSR curves corresponded well with the thresholds of the PTA contours averaged across subjects. The Mf-ASSRs were 20±8dB, 16±9dB, 12±9dB, and 11±12dB above the thresholds of the PTA for 500Hz, 1,000Hz, 2,000Hz, and 4,000Hz, respectively. The thresholds of the PTA and the Mf-ASSRs were significantly correlated (r=0.77-0.89). We found that the measurement of Mf-ASSRs is easy and potentially time saving, provides a response at all dichotic multiple frequencies of the conventional audiogram, reduces variability in the interpretation of the responses, and correlates well with the behavioral hearing thresholds in subjects with occupational noise-induced hearing impairment. Mf-ASSR can be a valuable aid in the adjustment of compensation cases."
"21800245","[Hearing loss in adolescents due to leisure noise. The OHRKAN study].","Alarming reports have been published about hearing loss in adolescents, and increasing leisure time noise exposure has been blamed. If the exposure limits from the Noise at Work Regulations are applied, discotheque music as well as music from portable music players are associated with the risk of hearing loss. The empirical evidence for this association, however, is not sufficient. Not even an increase in the prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss among adolescents can be documented. OHRKAN is a prospective cohort study aimed to produce information on the prevalence of hearing loss as well as its risk factors in adolescents. Currently, a total of 2,240 pupils in grade 9 at schools in the city of Regensburg, Germany, have been recruited. Data on noise exposure were collected using standardized questionnaires. In addition, hearing status was assessed by medical examination including tympanometry, audiometry, and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions. Developments in noise exposure as well as hearing status will be assessed in follow-up data collections. Independent of this empirical assessment preventive measures are already needed now to reduce the risk of hearing loss in adolescents and young adults."
"21769579","[Update: blast and explosion trauma].","In recent decades, acoustic shock and explosion traumas have increased in frequency in the general population. Beside the use of fireworks and firearms, airbag ignitions and explosions caused by terror or suicidal acts are also relevant. Depending on duration and strength of the sound pressure affecting the human ear, isolated inner ear damage or additional ear drum perforation and interruption of the middle ear ossicle chain can result. By means of otoscopy, pure tone audiometry, measurement of otoacoustic emissions, and other neurootological examinations, the severity of the trauma can be determined. With prompt and adequate therapy, permanent hearing loss can be minimized. In particular, the measurement of otoacoustic emissions allows conclusions to be made on the functionality of the outer hair cells which are damaged first in most cases. Histological investigations on noise-exposed cochleas show extensive damage to the outer hair cells in the frequency range between 1.0 and 4.0 kHz, which correlates well with audiometric measurements."

They were all exposed to noise over the risk-limits from weapons and vehicles and used earmuffs and/or earplugs. Questionnaires and pure tone screening audiometry were studied at the start and the end of the military service. Retrospective information regarding audiometry at conscription before military service was included as control. The prevalence values of tinnitus were 23% before and 32% after the service and of sensitivity to noise 16% and 19% respectively. The prevalence values of hearing impairment were 6.3% at conscription, 14.5% at reporting to military service, and 24% after the training period. The incidence values of hearing decline were 3.7% during the period with no military noise exposure and 6.6% during the military service. Acoustic accident increased the risk of worsened tinnitus and sensitivity to noise four times and for a high frequency hearing decline six times. We observed elevated prevalence values of tinnitus, sensitivity to noise and hearing impairment at discharge compared to before military service. We observed an elevated risk of hearing decline during military service. Acoustic accident increased the risk of tinnitus, noise sensitivity and hearing decline. We suggest improvements regarding inclusion criteria for military service, and for education regarding the HCP."

These students are generally involved in music-making/recording and listening to a high level, usually in environments with amplified music. Recent studies have shown that these students are potentially exposed to a high risk of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL( and are not covered by the same regulatory framework as employees. This study examined the pure tone air conduction hearing thresholds of 50 undergraduate students, including recent school leavers, on a range of popular music courses, to assess if there was evidence of hearing loss. Forty-four percent of students showed evidence of audiometric notch at 4-6 kHz, and 16% were classified under the UK Occupational Health and Safety guidelines as exhibiting mild hearing loss. Instance of audiometric notch was considerably higher than reported from studies of the general population but was around the same level or lower than that reported from studies of &quot;traditional&quot; music courses and conservatoires, suggesting no higher risk for popular music students than for &quot;classical&quot; music students. No relationship with age was present, suggesting that younger students were as likely to exhibit audiometric notch as mature students. This indicates that these students may be damaging their hearing through leisure activities while still at school, suggesting a need for robust education measures to focus on noise exposure of young people."
"21682404","Is it necessary to penalize impulsive noise +5 dB due to higher risk of hearing damage?","It is studied whether the +5 dB penalty for impulsiveness established by ISO 1999:1990 accounts for a higher risk of noise-induced hearing loss. A total of 16 normal-hearing human subjects were exposed for 10 min to two types of binaural industrial-recordings: (1) a continuous broad-band noise normalized to L(EX,8 h)=80 dBA and (2) the combination of the previous stimulus with an impulsive noise normalized to L(EX,8 h)=75+5(db penalty)=80 dBA (peak level 117 dBC and repetition rate of 0.5 impacts per second). Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were measured in a broad frequency range before and in the following 90 min after the exposure. The group results show that the continuous exposure had a bigger impact on DPOAE levels, with a maximum DPOAE shift of approximately 5 dB in the frequency range of 2-3.15 kHz during the first 10 min of the recovery. No evident DPOAE shift is seen for the impulsive + continuous stimulus. The results indicate that the penalty overestimated the effects on DPOAE levels and support the concept that the risk of hearing loss from low-level impulses may be predicted on an equal-energy basis."
"21674401","Audiometric thresholds and prevalence of tinnitus among male veterans in the United States: data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2006.","Hearing loss and tinnitus are the two most prevalent service-connected disabilities among U.S. veterans. The number of veterans receiving compensation and services from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for these conditions continues to increase annually. However, the majority of veterans in the United States do not use VA medical centers or clinics for healthcare and do not receive VA compensation payments. Therefore, the prevalence of hearing loss and tinnitus among U.S. veterans is unknown. This study used National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data to estimate the prevalence of these auditory conditions among male veterans. Between 1999 and 2006, pure tone audiometric data collected from 845 male veterans were compared with pure tone thresholds collected from 2,086 male nonveterans. We used questionnaire data collected between 1999 and 2004 to calculate and compare the prevalence of tinnitus for 2,174 veterans and 4,995 nonveterans. In general, pure tone thresholds did not differ significantly between veterans and nonveterans for most frequencies tested (500-8,000 Hz). The overall prevalence of tinnitus was greater for veterans than that for nonveterans (p &lt; 0.001), with statistically significant differences in the 50 to 59 and 60 to 69 age groups."

"21518430","High-frequency hearing loss, occupational noise exposure and hypertension: a cross-sectional study in male workers.","BACKGROUND: The association between occupational noise exposure and hypertension is inconsistent because of an exposure bias caused by outer-ear measurements of noise levels among workers. This study used hearing loss values (HLVs) measured at 4 kHz and 6 kHz in both ears as a biomarker to investigate the chronic effects of noise exposure on hypertension in 790 aircraft-manufacturing workers.METHODS: Participants were divided into a high hearing loss (HL) group (n = 214; average HLVs = 30 decibel [dB] at 4 kHz or 6 kHz bilaterally; 83.1 ± 4.9 A-weighted decibel [dBA]), a median HL group (n = 302; 15 = average HLVs &lt; 30 dB at 4 kHz or 6 kHz bilaterally; 83.1 ± 4.4 dBA) and a low HL group (n = 274; average HLVs &lt; 15 dB at 4 kHz or 6 kHz bilaterally; 82.2 ± 5.1 dBA) based on the results of pure tone audiometry. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to estimate the risk of hypertension between groups.RESULTS: The prevalence rates of hypertension were significantly higher in the high HL (43.5%; p = 0.021) and median HL (42.1%; p = 0.029) groups than in the low HL group (33.2%). The high HL and median HL workers had 1.48-fold (95% confidence interval [95%CI] = 1.02-2.15; p = 0.040) and 1.46-fold (95%CI = 1.03-2.05; p = 0.031) higher risks of hypertension relative to the low HL workers. Employment duration was significantly and positively correlated with the risk of hypertension among workers with average HLVs = 15 dB at 4 kHz (p &lt; 0.001) and 6 kHz (p &lt; 0.001) bilaterally.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that high-frequency hearing loss is a good biomarker of occupational noise exposure and that noise-induced hearing loss may be associated with the risk of hypertension."
"21419067","Some observations on the nature of the audiometric 4000 hz notch: data from 3430 veterans.","BACKGROUND: Pure-tone, air-conduction audiograms notched at 4000 Hz have long been considered the signature configuration for noise-induced hearing loss even though there is an extensive literature that does not mesh with this simple explanation. There are many reports of notched audiograms from individuals with no history of noise exposure and, conversely, reports of audiograms with no notches from individuals with a history of noise exposure. Recent reports increasingly suggest that unilateral 4000 Hz notches are common. The prevalence of notched audiograms at 4000 Hz is dependent on the definition of the notch and the population under study.PURPOSE: To examine the prevalence and characteristics of audiograms that are notched at 4000 Hz.RESEARCH DESIGN: Retrospective, descriptive.STUDY SAMPLE: The participants were 3430 veterans evaluated in the Audiology Clinic at the VA Medical Center, Mountain Home, Tennessee. The mean age was 62.3 yr. Data Collection and Analyses: The data were collected in the course of a 60 min, routine audiological evaluation. In addition to pure-tone audiometry, a history, otoscopy, speech audiometry in quiet and in noise, and aural-acoustic immittance measures were included in the clinic protocol but were not evaluated in this report. A notch was defined when the 4000 Hz threshold minus the 2000 Hz threshold and the 4000 Hz threshold minus the 8000 Hz threshold both were =10 dB.RESULTS: Overall the mean LE (left ear) thresholds at 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz were at hearing levels 2-3 dB higher than the hearing levels for the corresponding mean RE (right ear) thresholds; the differences were significant. A notched audiogram was observed in 40.6% of the participants in at least one ear with 15.4% having bilateral notches, 28.8% LE notches, and 27.1% RE notches. Unilateral 4000 Hz notches were almost twice as prevalent as bilateral 4000 Hz notches. Viewed as a function of age, notched audiograms were most common (~35% of the participants) in the 40 and 50 yr groups with a diminishing prevalence in the 60-80 yr groups. The mean notch depth at 4000 Hz was consistently 20-26 dB across the seven age groups. In comparison to the thresholds of the audiograms that were not notched, the thresholds of the audiograms with 4000 Hz notches (1) at 250-2000 Hz were at hearing levels 2-3 dB lower, (2) at 3000 and 4000 Hz were at hearing levels 8-17 dB higher, and (3) at 8000 Hz were at hearing levels 3-4 dB lower; the threshold differences were significant at all frequencies for both ears.CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that unilateral, 4000 Hz notched audiograms are as common or more common than bilateral notched audiograms and that unilateral notched audiograms are equally common for the LE and RE. The prevalence and characteristics of 4000 Hz notched audiograms in this veteran sample are similar to those observed in the population as a whole."

"21236610","Hearing loss after noise exposure.","The higher field strength magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) such as 3 Tesla (T) and above generates noise that has potential detrimental effects on the hearing. Temporary threshold shifts following MRI examination have been reported for MRI with lower field strength. Such effect, however, have not been reported so far for a 3T MRI. We report a case that exemplifies the possible detrimental effects of a 3 T MRI generated noise on the auditory system. Our patient underwent investigation of his chronic backache in a 3 T MRI unit and developed hearing loss and tinnitus post-MRI examination. Hearing assessment was done using pure tone audiogram, distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) and brainstem electrical response audiometry (BERA) which revealed a unilateral sensorineural hearing loss which recovered within 3 days. However the tinnitus persisted. This is possibly a case of temporary threshold shift following noise exposure. However a sudden sensorineural hearing loss remains the other possibility."
"21203771","A retrospective analysis of noise-induced hearing loss in the Dutch construction industry.","PURPOSE: Noise exposure is an important and highly prevalent occupational hazard in the construction industry. This study examines hearing threshold levels of a large population of Dutch construction workers and compares their hearing thresholds to those predicted by ISO-1999.METHODS: In this retrospective study, medical records of periodic occupational health examinations of 29,644 construction workers are analysed. Pure-tone audiometric thresholds of noise-exposed workers are compared to a non-exposed control group and to ISO-1999 predictions. Regression analyses are conducted to explore the relationship between hearing loss and noise intensity, noise exposure time and the use of hearing protection.RESULTS: Noise-exposed workers had greater hearing losses compared to their non-noise-exposed colleagues and to the reference population reported in ISO-1999. Noise exposure explained only a small proportion of hearing loss. When the daily noise exposure level rose from 80 dB(A) towards 96 dB(A), only a minor increase in hearing loss is shown. The relation of exposure time and hearing loss found was similar to ISO-1999 predictions when looking at durations of 10 years or more. For the first decade, the population medians show poorer hearing than predicted by ISO-1999.DISCUSSION: Duration of noise exposure was a better predictor than noise exposure levels, probably because of the limitations in noise exposure estimations. In this population, noise-induced hearing loss was already present at the beginning of employment and increased at the same rate as is predicted for longer exposure durations."

"22992262","Pure-tone hearing asymmetry: a logistic approach modeling age, sex, and noise exposure history.","BACKGROUND: Asymmetric hearing loss (AHL) can be an early sign of vestibular schwannoma (VS). However, recognizing VS-induced AHL is challenging. There is no universally accepted definition of a &quot;medically significant pure-tone hearing asymmetry,&quot; in part because AHL is a common feature of medically benign forms of hearing loss (e.g., age- or firearm-related hearing loss). In most cases, the determination that an observed AHL does not come from a benign cause involves subjective clinical judgment.PURPOSE: Our purpose was threefold: (1) to quantify hearing asymmetry distributions in a large group of patients with medically benign forms of hearing loss, stratifying for age, sex, and noise exposure history; (2) to assess how previously proposed hearing asymmetry calculations segregate tumor from nontumor cases; and (3) to present the results of a logistic regression method for defining hearing asymmetry that incorporates age, sex, and noise information.RESEARCH DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.STUDY SAMPLE: Five thousand six hundred and sixty-one patients with idiopathic, age- or noise exposure-related hearing loss and 85 untreated VS patients.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Audiometric, patient history, and clinical impression data were collected from 22,785 consecutive patient visits to the audiology section at Mayo Clinic in Florida from 2006 to 2009 to screen for eligibility. Those eligible were then stratified by VS presence, age, sex, and self-reported noise exposure history. Pure-tone asymmetry distributions were analyzed. Audiometric data from VS diagnoses were used to create four additional audiograms per patient to model the hypothetical development of AHL prior to the actual hearing test. The ability of 11 previously defined hearing asymmetry calculations to distinguish between VS and non-VS cases was described. A logistic regression model was developed that integrated age, sex, and noise exposure history with pure-tone asymmetry data. Regression model performance was then compared to existing asymmetry calculation methods.RESULTS: The 11 existing pure-tone asymmetry calculations varied in tumor detection performance. Age, sex, and noise exposure history helped to predict benign forms of hearing asymmetry. The logistic regression model outperformed existing asymmetry calculations and better accounted for normal age-, sex-, and noise exposure-related asymmetry variability.CONCLUSIONS: Our logistic regression asymmetry method improves the clinician's ability to estimate risk of VS, in part by integrating categorical patient history and numeric test data. This form of modeling can enhance clinical decision making in audiology and otology."
"22940166","Effect of recreational noise exposure on hearing impairment among teenage students.","Several studies have focused on the potential impact of children's hearing loss on learning and development. Recently, numerous teenage students have been found to be fond of listening to music on personal devices and participating in recreational music activities. The objective of this study was to investigate teenage students' hearing impairment, their experience with recreational noise exposure, and their self-reported hearing. The participants were 1878 first-year students at a university in Taiwan. The result of the pure tone audiometry test showed that 11.9% of the participants had one or two ears with a hearing threshold over 25 dB. Over the past year, approximately 80.9% of the participants had taken part in at least one loud-noise recreational activity, and 90.9% of the participants were in the habit of using earphones. Among the participants, 190 students with a high level of recreational noise exposure were assigned to the exposure group, and 191 students with a low level of recreational noise exposure constituted the control group. The exposure group had more hearing problems than the control group, but no significant difference existed between the two groups in the pure tone audiometry test (p=0.857). It is suggested that the schools should reinforce hearing health education and proactively provide intervention measures, such as hearing tests, evaluation of noise exposure, and hearing protection."

Thirty soldiers served as a control group.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pure tone threshold changes detected by PTA and EFA, amplitude and reproducibility changes in transiently evoked OAE, distortion products, and tinnitus analysis based on a visual analog scale.RESULTS: Assault rifle-induced AAT caused unilateral temporary threshold shifts (TTS) in PTA and bilateral TTS in EFA. Two frequency regions with the largest threshold shifts were identified: one between 3 and 6 kHz and another between 11 and 14 kHz. The reproducibility of transiently evoked OAEs revealed changes related to the acoustic trauma in the 3- to 5-kHz frequency window. The amplitudes of the low stimulation level distortion products at 6 kHz were correlated with the audiometric AAT-induced TTS.CONCLUSION: Acute acoustic trauma-induced audiometric TTS are predominantly confined to 2 specific frequency regions. PTA and EFA are both necessary to identify the full extent of acute acoustic trauma. PTA and EFA revealed that the TTSs were correlated to with distortion product OAE amplitude shifts at 6 kHz and changes in the reproducibility of transiently evoked OAE in the 3- to 5-kHz frequency window. PTA remains the most important measurement to monitor AAT. It may be useful to complement it with EFA, focusing on the 11 to 14 kHz frequency range. If used, OAE should be analyzed in the frequency range of 3 to 6 kHz."

The thresholds of higher frequency band, 3 kHz and 4 kHz were compared with the threshold of ABR. The thresholds of auditory frequency ban and 0.5 kHz were compared with the threshold of 40 Hz AERP.RESULTS: A better correlation was found between thresholds of ABR and higher frequency pure tone audiometry. There was a significant difference of thresholds between 40 kHz AERP and pure tone audiometry. The correction values of thresholds between 40 kHz AERP and pure tone audiometry in the light noise-induced hearing impairment group and the moderate noise-induced hearing impairment group were (16.43 ± 1.08) and (11.80 ± 1.12) dBn HL, respectively.CONCLUSION: In diagnosis of occupational noise-induced hearing impairment, the threshold of ABR can be used to estimate the hearing threshold of pure noise higher frequency. Because there is the significant difference of the thresholds between pure tone audiometry and 40 Hz AERP, the response threshold can not be served as the audiometry threshold, and the behavioral hearing thresholds can only be obtained by adjusting the response threshold with respective correction value."
"22718110","Prevalence of permanent hearing threshold shift among workers of Indian iron and steel small and medium enterprises: a study.","Occupational noise exposure and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) have been recognized as a problem among workers in Indian industries. The major industries in India are based on manufacturing. There are appreciable numbers of casting and forging units spread across the country. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of permanent hearing threshold shift among the workers engaged in Indian iron and steel small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and compared with control group subjects. As a part of hearing protection intervention, audiometric tests were conducted at low (250-1000 Hz), medium (1500-3000 Hz), and high (4000-8000 Hz) frequencies. The occurrence of hearing loss was determined based on hearing threshold levels with a low fence of 25 dB. Comparisons were made for hearing threshold at different frequencies between the exposed and control groups using Student's t test. ANOVA was used for the comparison of hearing threshold dB at different frequencies among occupation and year of experience. A P value &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All data were presented as mean value (SD). Over 90% of workers engaged in various processes of casting and forging industry showed hearing loss in the noise-sensitive medium and higher frequencies. Occupation was significantly associated with NIHL, and hearing loss was particularly high among the workers of forging section. The analyses revealed a higher prevalence of significant hearing loss among the forging workers compared to the workers associated with other activities. The study shows alarming signals of NIHL, especially in forging workers. The occupational exposure to noise could be minimized by efficient control measures through engineering controls, administrative controls, and the use of personal protective devices. Applications of engineering and/or administrative controls are frequently not feasible in the developing countries for technical and financial reasons. A complete hearing conservation programme, including training, audiometry, job rotation, and the use of hearing protection devices, is the most feasible method for the protection of industrial workers from prevailing noise in workplace environments in the developing countries."

Failure of the screening was defined by missing at least one frequency in one ear. In addition to hearing screening, the students filled out a questionnaire asking for practices related to exposure to loud music.STUDY SAMPLE: 1296 adolescents aged 14 to 15 years.RESULTS: The overall rate of failing the hearing screening was 14.9% (95% CI: 13.0%-16.8%). The rate was similar in adolescents with no, little, or moderate exposure to loud music (10% to 15%), but significantly increased (22% to 25%) in adolescents with high exposure.CONCLUSIONS: The observed failing rate compares well to findings on the prevalence of hearing deficits in adolescents reported in other studies. In addition, our study suggests that the risk for hearing damage from loud music is not steadily increasing with increase of exposure, but exists only under conditions of extreme listening."
"22568995","The effect of noise exposure on the cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential.","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of noise exposure on the cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP) in individuals with asymmetric noise-induced sensorineural hearing loss (NIHL).DESIGN: A cross-sectional observational study was used to compare cVEMP characteristics in 43 individuals with a history of noise exposure greater in one ear (e.g., the left ear of a right-handed rifle shooter) and asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss consistent with the history of noise exposure and in 14 age-matched controls. The characteristics of hearing loss were examined further for the noise-exposed participants with abnormal cVEMPs and the noise-exposed participants with normal cVEMPs.RESULTS: Thirty-three percent of the noise-exposed participants had abnormal cVEMPs, whereas cVEMPs were present and symmetrical in 100% of the age-matched controls, and cVEMP threshold was greater in the noise-exposed group than in the control group. Abnormal cVEMPs occurred most often in the ears with poorer hearing (or greater NIHL), and the noise-exposed participants who had abnormal cVEMPs had poorer high-frequency pure-tone thresholds (greater NIHL) and greater interaural high-frequency pure-tone threshold differences than the noise-exposed participants with normal cVEMPs.CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with previous studies that suggest that the sacculocollic pathway may be susceptible to noise-related damage. There is emerging evidence that the severity of NIHL is associated with the presence or absence of cVEMPs."
"22517306","Early occupational hearing loss of workers in a stone crushing industry: our experience in a developing country.","Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is an irreversible sensorineural hearing loss associated with exposure to high levels of excessive noise. This paper aims to assess the prevalence of early NIHL and the awareness of the effects of noise on health among stone crushing industry workers. This was a comparative cross-sectional study in Ghana of 140 workers from the stone crushing industry compared with a control group of 150 health workers. The stone workers and controls were evaluated using a structured questionnaire, which assessed symptoms of hearing loss, tinnitus, knowledge on the health hazards associated with work in noisy environment and the use of hearing protective device. Pure tone audiometric assessment was carried out for stone workers and controls. Noise levels at the work stations of the stone workers and of the controls were measured. Statistical Analysis of data was carried out using SPSS package version 16. The mean age of stone workers and controls was 42.58±7.85 and 42.19±12 years, respectively. Subjective hearing loss occurred in 21.5% of the workers and in 2.8% of the controls. Tinnitus occurred in 26.9% of stone workers and 21.5% of controls, while 87.5% stone workers had sound knowledge on the health hazards of a noisy environment. Early NIHL in the left ear occurred in 19.3% of the stone workers compared with 0.7% in controls and in the right ear, it occurred in 14.3% of the stone workers and in 1.3% of the controls; P&lt;0.005.

TEOAEs showed an overall deterioration while both individual deteriorations and enhancements were larger than chance. DPOAE at 6 kHz showed the largest group-averaged change, while the number of individual shifts was not significant. There were no clear relations between changes in audiometry and changes in OAE.CONCLUSION: Significant individual OAE changes do not necessarily follow the same pattern as the group-averaged results. This limits the applicability of OAE testing for the monitoring of individual subjects. Furthermore, hearing deterioration might manifest itself in a local enhancement of otoacoustic emissions and not only in the form of decreases in amplitude."

Group A underwent therapy with sodium enoxaparin for 10 days, followed by an additional 10 days of treatment after 10 days of no treatment. Group B received placebo as a control. Before treatment, at the end of treatment, and 2 months after the end of treatment, all patients underwent evaluation by laboratory tests, pure tone audiometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) testing, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) testing, and auditory brain stem response testing.RESULTS: In contrast to group B, at the end of the treatment in group A pure tone audiometry showed a significant (p &lt; 0.05) improvement of the audiometric thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 kHz. Depending on the air and bone conduction thresholds, TEOAEs and DPOAEs, which had previously been absent, were evoked at the frequencies examined. These improvements were confirmed at last follow-up.

"22387711","Validation of a questionnaire to identify hearing loss among farm operators.","Workers in certain industries (e.g., agriculture) do not participate in a hearing conservation program and rarely receive this important preventive care. The National Institute for Deafness and Communication Disorders (NIDCD) has published a questionnaire to assess a person's need for medical examination of their hearing. The use of a self-administered questionnaire may pose a simple, low cost opportunity to assess the hearing health of workers not included in a hearing conservation program. However, the validity of the NIDCD questionnaire has not been tested. A study was conducted to compare the results of audiometric screening and the NIDCD questionnaire in identifying persons at risk for hearing impairment who may benefit from a medical referral. Data were collected from 103 farm operators at a regional farm show. Receiver-operator characteristic curves, measuring the ability of the questionnaire to correctly classify those with and without the disease suggested that the level of performance of the questionnaire as a whole, ranged from 0.74 to 0.69 (fair to poor). However, selected questionnaire items (e.g., Do you have to strain to understand conversations?) had moderate agreement (0.38 to 0.41) with screening audiogram results. Overall, the 10-item instrument did not perform as well as instruments with fewer items reported in separate studies. These findings suggest that, while less desirable than audiometry, alternative self-administered instruments might perform the better in this group. This approach may be useful as an alternative screening method to detect risk of hearing loss and identifying the need for medical evaluation of hearing sensitivity, particularly among farm operators."
"22387708","Validity of hearing impairment calculation methods for prediction of self-reported hearing handicap.","Worker's compensation for hearing loss caused by occupational noise exposure is calculated by varying methods, from state to state within the United States (US), with many employing arithmetic formulas based on the pure-tone audiogram, to quantify hearing loss. Several assumptions unsupported or weakly supported by empirical data underlie these formulas. The present study evaluated the ability of various arithmetic hearing impairment calculations to predict a self-reported hearing handicap in a sample of presenting with sensorineural hearing loss. 204 adults (127 male, 77 female) ranging in age from 18 to 94 served as participants. The sample was selected to exclude patients who had been referred for hearing testing for a medicolegal examination or a hearing conservation appointment. A hearing handicap was measured by the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults/for the Elderly (HHIA/E). The covariance analysis of linear structural equations was used to assess the relative strength of correlation with the HHIA/E score among the six formulas and various forms of pure-tone average. The results revealed that all the hearing impairment calculations examined were significantly, but weakly, correlated with the self-reported hearing impairment scores. No significant differences among the predictive abilities of the impairment calculations were evident; however, the average binaural impairment assigned differed significantly among the six calculations examined. Individuals who demonstrated 0% impairment had significantly lower (i.e., better) HHIA/E scores compared to those with non-zero impairment for each formula. These results supported the idea that audiometric data provided an insufficient explanation for real-world hearing difficulties."
"22387707","Audiological and electrophysiological assessment of professional pop/rock musicians.","In the present study, we evaluated peripheral and central auditory pathways in professional musicians (with and without hearing loss) compared to non-musicians. The goal was to verify if music exposure could affect auditory pathways as a whole. This is a prospective study that compared the results obtained between three groups (musicians with and without hearing loss and non-musicians). Thirty-two male individuals participated and they were assessed by: Immittance measurements, pure-tone air conduction thresholds at all frequencies from 0.25 to 20 kHz, Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions, Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR), and Cognitive Potential. The musicians showed worse hearing thresholds in both conventional and high frequency audiometry when compared to the non-musicians; the mean amplitude of Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions was smaller in the musicians group, but the mean latencies of Auditory Brainstem Response and Cognitive Potential were diminished in the musicians when compared to the non-musicians. Our findings suggest that the population of musicians is at risk for developing music-induced hearing loss. However, the electrophysiological evaluation showed that latency waves of ABR and P300 were diminished in musicians, which may suggest that the auditory training to which these musicians are exposed acts as a facilitator of the acoustic signal transmission to the cortex."

The purposes of this study were to determine the intensity and frequency components of dental instruments used by dental staff nurses and the prevalence of noise induced hearing loss.METHODOLOGY: We performed a comparative, cross sectional study on a group of dental staff nurses. Participants underwent ear examination followed by pure tone audiometry. Pure tone audiometry was performed at least 48 hours after the participants were free from noise exposure. Noise induced hearing loss was defined as failed definitive threshold at a frequency of 4000 Hz greater than 20 dB. The intensity level, noise spectrum, and frequency of hand piece, saliva suction, and scaler were recorded during the dental procedure.RESULTS: A total of 65 dental staff nurses were included. The mean intensity of hand pieces, scalers, and saliva suctions were 88.7 (SD2.2), 87.1 (SD2.6), and 77.4 (SD6.3) dBA while their most prominent frequencies were 3880, 7997, and 3513 Hz, respectively. Three of the subjects had slightly more than 20 dB hearing loss at 4 kHz on audiogram; all were affected unilaterally. These three individuals worked as dental nurses for 11, 13, and 21 years, respectively. Therefore, the prevalence of noise induced hearing loss was 5.0% (95% CI: -1.0%, 10.0%).CONCLUSIONS: Dental staff nurses might have an increased risk of noise induced hearing loss, depending upon individual factors influencing susceptibility and duration of noise exposure."
"22326290","Relative risk of elevated hearing threshold compared to ISO1999 normative populations for Royal Australian Air Force male personnel.","OBJECTIVE: This paper introduces a new method to calculate relative risks of elevated hearing thresholds, at various ages and frequencies, between a study population and ISO1999:2003: Annex A Screened, Annex B Unscreened and ISO1999 Section 5.3 adjustment for noise exposure using Annex A Screened data. We demonstrate this method on a study population of male Royal Australian Air Force personnel.STUDY DESIGN: Using a retrospective cohort design, hearing thresholds were assessed in 583 F-111 aircraft maintenance personnel, 377 technical-trade comparisons and 492 non-technical comparisons using pure-tone audiometry. A quantile regression model was used determine whether an association exists between median hearing thresholds and F-111 maintenance, adjusting for possible confounders. The new method involves using quantile regression models with bootstrapped standard errors to estimate percentiles for the study population and thus determine the probability of a greater than 25 dB hearing threshold. This was done for the three ISO datasets as follows; for the ISO1999 Annex A screened population data the formula provided allows the calculation of these probabilities. ISO1999 Annex B unscreened population data only provides the values for the 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles at ages 30, 40, 50 and 60 only, therefore it was necessary to fit a curve to these values in order to estimate the probabilities. For ISO1999 Section 5.3 adjustment for noise exposure population we used the Annex A screened population data plus the formula. The probabilities were then divided to give the relative risks of a greater than 25 dB hearing threshold, at various ages and frequencies.RESULTS: While no difference was observed between the three groups, the model identified a number of significant confounders, namely tinnitus, smoking, diabetes and the use of anti-depressant medications. Relative risks were high at frequencies 2 kHz and less for the study population of all ages compared to ISO A screened data. The increased relative risks at 4 and 6 kHz give the appearance of a &quot;noise notch&quot; for ages 30 and 40 years. The comparison with the ISO B unscreened data are significantly less than one for frequencies above 2 kHz, particularly for young men and greater than one less than 2 kHz. The relative risks for the comparison to the ISO A screened data with ISO 5.3 adjustments, are highest for young men decreasing with age, with the highest relative risk are at frequencies less than 2 kHz.CONCLUSIONS: This paper demonstrates a new method for quantifying the probability of a clinically relevant hearing loss and the relative risk of the loss due to a risk factor. Prior to this, researchers were reduced to simplistic methods such as visual comparison of deciles which did not enable the estimation of risk. The new method can use all observed hearing thresholds per study participant, adjust for known confounding factors such age and gender, and calculate the relative risk of a clinically relevant increase in hearing threshold due to a risk factor of interest."
"22234848","[Göttingen sentence in noise for different audiogram classes].","BACKGROUND: In addition to the standardized Freiburg sentence test in silence validated speech tests in noise are available. They are mainly used to test the benefit of hearing systems in everyday-life situations. In diagnostics tests in noise can also give additional information of the patients' hearing impairment. The determined speech reception threshold (SRT) depends on the degree of hearing loss and the used speech and noise test material. Aim of this study was to analyze the results of the Göttingen sentence test in noise in relation to different audiogram classes.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Göttingen sentence test in stationary noise (65 dB) was performed for 135 patients with different degrees of hearing losses. Based on the air-conducted threshold all ears were categorized to an audiogram class by an automated procedure.RESULTS: For the mild hearing losses the results of the Göttingen sentence test increased with increasing pure-tone-average (PTA) and the values are smaller than 0 dB SNR with a small standard deviation (± 1-2 dB SNR). For the moderate hearing losses values of 5 dB SNR with a standard deviation of 6 dB SNR were achieved on average. Patients with a high hearing loss achieved values higher than 20 dB SNR.CONCLUSION: For the mild hearing losses the results were located in a small range. However, they can give important information about the patient's hearing impairment mainly appears in a noisy environment. With increasing hearing loss also the reduced hearing in silence affects the results achieved with the Göttingen sentence test in noise. Therefore the hearing in silence has to be taken into account at the interpretation of the results."
"24220478","Occupational safety threats among dental personnel and related risk factors.","Occupational diseases are primarily considered to be important health problems for individuals with occupations in heavy industry fields. Although dentists work in very clean and elegant offices, they are frequently exposed to various chemicals and high-intensity, sound-producing instruments, such as compressors and aerators. In our study, we aimed to investigate the risk for occupational hearing loss of dental personnel, by performing pure-tone audiometry in 40 dentists and comparing the results with those of healthy individuals. We also sampled the nasal mucosa to investigate the effects of occupational chemicals on the nasal mucosa of the dentists. The pure-tone audiometric thresholds at 5 different frequencies (1000, 2000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz) and working time were evaluated as potential risk factors. The pure-tone audiometric results (as decibels) at each frequency and the median values for each side (right and left ears) were significantly higher for dentists than for the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The pure-tone audiometric results did not significantly differ between the women and men in the study group (P &gt; 0.05). The findings in the nasal mucosa (goblet cell hyperplasia, neutrophil/eosinophil/basophil distribution, metaplasia, dysplasia, premalignant or malignant cells) were similar in the study and control groups (P &gt; 0.05). In conclusion, our study indicated that high-intensity, sound-producing equipment is an important occupational threat for dentists, whereas chemical agents have minimal hazardous effects. "
"24212050","Left hemisphere fractional anisotropy increase in noise-induced tinnitus: a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study of white matter tracts in the brain.","Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a contemporary neuroimaging modality used to study connectivity patterns and microstructure of white matter tracts in the brain. The use of DTI in the study of tinnitus is a relatively unexplored methodology with no studies focusing specifically on tinnitus induced by noise exposure. In this investigation, participants were two groups of adults matched for etiology, age, and degree of peripheral hearing loss, but differed by the presence or absence (+/-) of tinnitus. It is assumed that matching individuals on the basis of peripheral hearing loss, allows for differentiating changes in white matter microstructure due to hearing loss from changes due to the effects of chronic tinnitus. Alterations in white matter tracts, using the fractional anisotropy (FA) metric, which measures directional diffusion of water, were quantified using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) with additional details provided by in vivo probabilistic tractography. Our results indicate that 10 voxel clusters differentiated the two groups, including 9 with higher FA in the group with tinnitus. A decrease in FA was found for a single cluster in the group with tinnitus. However, seven of the 9 clusters with higher FA were in left hemisphere thalamic, frontal, and parietal white matter. These foci were localized to the anterior thalamic radiations and the inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi. The two right-sided clusters with increased FA were located in the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and superior longitudinal fasciculus. The only decrease in FA for the tinnitus-positive group was found in the superior longitudinal fasciculus of the left parietal lobe. "
"24131608","Extended high-frequency thresholds in college students: effects of music player use and other recreational noise.","BACKGROUND: Human hearing is sensitive to sounds from as low as 20 Hz to as high as 20,000 Hz in normal ears. However, clinical tests of human hearing rarely include extended high-frequency (EHF) threshold assessments, at frequencies extending beyond 8000 Hz. EHF thresholds have been suggested for use monitoring the earliest effects of noise on the inner ear, although the clinical usefulness of EHF threshold testing is not well established for this purpose.PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study was to determine if EHF thresholds in healthy, young adult college students vary as a function of recreational noise exposure.RESEARCH DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of a laboratory database was conducted; all participants with both EHF threshold testing and noise history data were included. The potential for &quot;preclinical&quot; EHF deficits was assessed based on the measured thresholds, with the noise surveys used to estimate recreational noise exposure.STUDY SAMPLE: EHF thresholds measured during participation in other ongoing studies were available from 87 participants (34 male and 53 female); all participants had hearing within normal clinical limits (=25 HL) at conventional frequencies (0.25-8 kHz).RESULTS: EHF thresholds closely matched standard reference thresholds [ANSI S3.6 (1996) Annex C]. There were statistically reliable threshold differences in participants who used music players, with 3-6 dB worse thresholds at the highest test frequencies (10-16 kHz) in participants who reported long-term use of music player devices (&gt;5 yr), or higher listening levels during music player use.CONCLUSIONS: It should be possible to detect small changes in high-frequency hearing for patients or participants who undergo repeated testing at periodic intervals. However, the increased population-level variability in thresholds at the highest frequencies will make it difficult to identify the presence of small but potentially important deficits in otherwise normal-hearing individuals who do not have previously established baseline data."
"24116664","The audiological health of horn players.","Among orchestral musicians, horn players are one of the most at-risk groups for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). To investigate this group further, pure tone audiometry and a 14-item questionnaire were used to assess the hearing health, as well as attitudes and practices regarding hearing conservation, among 142 French horn players attending an international horn conference in Brisbane, Australia. Of this study's French horn players, 11.1% to 22.2%, and 17.7% to 32.9% of those aged =40 years, showed some form of hearing loss (corrected for age and gender) typical of NIHL, using conservative versus lenient criteria, respectively. Stepwise multiple regression analyses showed no obvious predictor of hearing loss in this study's participants. Of the 18% of participants who reported using hearing protection, 81% used this protection &quot;sometimes&quot; and 50% used generic, foam, or other inferior forms of protection. Continued efforts to better manage the hearing health of horn players is warranted particularly as any hearing loss will affect a horn player's ability to perform and therefore his or her livelihood. Managing the hearing health of horn players will be challenging, however, with no simple predictor of NIHL loss being identified in this study's sample."
"24114066","A longitudinal study of changes in distortion-product otoacoustic emissions and pure-tone thresholds in an industrial setting.","In a longitudinal study of 76 noise-exposed industrial workers, 34 (68 ears) of them were available for final evaluation after 9 years of observation. Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DP) at 65/55 dB SPL and pure-tone audiometry were used to detect noise-induced inner ear changes. Repeated measures analyses of variance were made on the subjects and in a control group, whereas significant threshold shifts (STS) and significant emission shifts (SES) were calculated. Both hearing thresholds and DP showed a high-frequency deterioration, but there was absence of statistical correlation between elevation of hearing thresholds and decrease of DP. There was no clear pattern between individual changes in audiometric thresholds and DP, and all combinations were present: ears with only STS, ears with only SES, ears with both STS and SES and ears with absence of STS and SES. Audiometric changes were maximal at 4 and 6 kHz and DP changes at 2 and 3 kHz. Since significant individual emission changes do not necessarily follow the same pattern as the group-averaged results, the use of DP for monitoring of individual subjects is not advised. However, its use in conjunction with audiometry in hearing conservation programs is highly recommended."
"24096863","Noise levels among spectators at an intercollegiate sporting event.","PURPOSE: The intensity of noise levels in a basketball arena during games, as well as the hearing sensitivity of attendees, was measured for the purpose of assessing the impact of the noise on hearing thresholds.METHOD: Noise levels at 10 intercollegiate basketball games were measured with a dosimeter affixed on the shoulders of attendees. Hearing thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emissions were measured for 20 participants just before attending a basketball game and within an hour of the end of the game to determine whether changes in hearing thresholds resulted from exposure to the sound levels within the arena during the games.RESULTS: Participants demonstrated temporary shifts in pure-tone thresholds and reductions in the intensity of their otoacoustic emissions after attendance at 1 of the basketball games. Dosimeter measurements showed that noise at 6 of the 10 basketball games exceeded acceptable intensity levels when compared with a national workplace noise exposure standard.CONCLUSION: Although noise intensities, on average, did not exceed workplace exposure standards, universities would be wise to be proactive in warning spectators about the potential dangers of noise exposure at sporting events, make earplugs available to interested spectators, and implement a hearing conservation program for employees working in noise."
"24005271","[The hearing function and vegetative reactions in airport technicians using individual hearing protectors].","The objective of the present study was to evaluate the hearing function in the airport technical personnel and estimate the effectiveness of multicomponent anti-noise hearing protectors used by the specialists engaged in the aircraft maintenance. The tonal threshold audiometry was carried out before and after a shiftwork. The extra-aural effect of noise was assessed from the characteristics of cardiac rhythm variability. The study included two groups of subjects: in one of them (n=8) they used ordinary flight headsets (control) in the other the protection was ensured with the help of multi-insert hearing protectors (n=16). The initial hearing thresholds were found to be increased up to 70 and 60 dB at the frequencies of 4 and 8 kHz respectively. The regression analysis revealed the relationship between these parameters and the duration of aerodrome work experience. Temporary threshold shifts were observed only in the control group. An increase in the tone of the sympathetic nervous system was observed in the control subjects but was absent in the study group. It is concluded that the multi-component hearing protectors employed in the present study are highly efficacious anti-noise devices. The mechanisms of noise-induced hearing loss are discussed. "
"23887702","Hearing loss and use of hearing protection among career firefighters in the United States.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and characteristics of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and the use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) among career firefighters.METHODS: A Web-based survey and a standard audiometric test were performed with 425 firefighters from three states in the United States.RESULTS: More than 40% showed hearing loss in the noise-sensitive frequencies (4 and 6 kHz). The left ear showed significantly poorer hearing than the right ear. Firefighters having longer years of work in fire services demonstrated significantly worse hearing. Reported use of HPDs was 34% of the time that was needed. Firefighters who used HPDs less were significantly more likely to have hearing loss.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a considerable NIHL problem and low use of HPDs in firefighters. More comprehensive hearing conservation programs should be implemented to reduce NIHL for firefighters."
"23860785","[The Königsteiner Empfehlung of 2012 - essential alterations and modifications].","BACKGROUND: Since 1974, the recommendation for assessment of hearing impairment caused by noise - formerly known as &quot;Königsteiner Merkblatt&quot; (now: &quot;Königsteiner Empfehlung&quot;) - has been representing the state of the art for the assessment of the occupational disease BK-No. 2301. It was updated several times, the last time in 2012. It provides a summary of the current medical knowledge. A new measurement for the entire working life - the Effective Noise Dose by Liedtke - was introduced. Otoacoustic emissions (OAE) are now the crucial tests in order to detect a hair cell dysfunction. As from now the tinnitus has to be put under a more comprehensive examination. On the strength of post experience the previous speech audiometry (Freiburger Test) is reliable, it was retrained. In future the indication for hearing aids will be oriented towards the aid guidelines of the legal health insurance. The questionnaire for the expert opinion was revised and the fee was adapted."
"23842602","Impulse noise exposure in early adulthood accelerates age-related hearing loss.","The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of impulse noise on age-related hearing loss. The study consisted of two groups. Each group contained 109 men. Group I comprised veterans with normal hearing at the end of 1979 sino-vietnamese war. All these veterans were randomly selected from Guangzhou Military Command. Group II were men with no military experience randomly chosen from the health examination center of Guangzhou General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command. Pure-tone thresholds of these two groups were measured and compared. The pure-tone thresholds of Group I were poorer than those of Group II at the frequencies of 4, 6 and 8 kHz. Thus, impulse noise accelerates age-related hearing loss. "
"23819619","Speech-in-noise screening tests by internet, part 3: test sensitivity for uncontrolled parameters in domestic usage.","OBJECTIVE: The online speech-in-noise test 'Earcheck' is sensitive for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). This study investigates effects of uncontrollable parameters in domestic self-screening, such as presentation level and transducer type, on speech reception thresholds (SRTs) obtained with Earcheck.DESIGN: Subjects performed 26 Earchecks that differed regarding presentation level (65, 71, and 77 dBA), presentation mode (monotic or diotic), and masking noise (two different low-pass filtered noises) in the lab. To investigate effects of test environment, participants conducted eight additional Earchecks at home using different transducer types (headphones or loudspeakers).STUDY SAMPLE: Thirty noise-exposed workers, either normal-hearing (n = 10), or with different degrees of NIHL (n = 20), participated.RESULTS: There was a minor effect of presentation levels exceeding 65 dBA in severely impaired listeners. Diotic presentation mode yielded lower SRTs compared to monotic presentation mode. Normal-hearing test results at home were poorer than in the laboratory, whereas hearing-impaired subjects performed better in domestic testing. Using loudspeakers deteriorated SRTs significantly in comparison to headphones, but only in hearing-impaired subjects.CONCLUSIONS: A monotic presentation mode using headphones is recommended for domestic screening. Since domestic testing affects SRT results, a follow up study using a large study population should assess Earcheck's validity when performed at home."
"23812554","Evaluation of early hearing damage in personal listening device users using extended high-frequency audiometry and otoacoustic emissions.","Although sound exposure from personal listening devices (PLDs) could potentially lead to noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), the actual hearing risk associated with the use of these devices is still unclear. In this study, early hearing effects related to PLD usage were evaluated in 35 young adult PLD users (listening for &gt;1 h/day, at &gt;50% of the maximum volume setting of their devices) and their age- and sex-matched controls using a combination of conventional and extended high-frequency audiometry as well as transient-evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) and distortion product of otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) measurements. The mean listening duration of the PLD users was 2.7 ± 1.0 h/day while their estimated average listening volume was 81.3 ± 9.0 dBA (free-field corrected). Typical signs of NIHL were not detected in the audiogram of PLD users and their audiometric thresholds at most of the conventional test frequencies (0.25-8 kHz) were comparable with those obtained from controls. However, compared with the controls, mean hearing thresholds of PLD users at many of the extended high-frequencies (9-16 kHz) were significantly higher. In addition, TEOAE and DPOAE amplitudes in users were reduced compared with controls. The deterioration of extended high-frequency thresholds and the decrease in DPOAE amplitudes were more evident in the users' right ears. These results indicate the presence of an early stage of hearing damage in the PLD user group. Preventive steps should be taken as the initial hearing damage in these users could eventually progress into permanent NIHL after many years of PLD use."
"23800806","Hearing conservation program for marching band members: a risk for noise-induced hearing loss?","PURPOSE: To examine the risk for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in university marching band members and to provide an overview of a hearing conservation program for a marching band.METHOD: Sound levels during band rehearsals were recorded and audiometric hearing thresholds and transient otoacoustic emission were measured over a 3-year period. Musician's earplugs and information about hearing loss were provided to the students. The hearing thresholds of other college students were tested as a partial control.RESULTS: There were no significant differences in hearing thresholds between the two groups. During initial testing, more marching band members showed apparent high-frequency notches than control students. Follow-up hearing tests in a subsequent year for the marching band members showed that almost all notches disappeared. Persistent standard threshold shift (STS) across tests was not observed in the band members.CONCLUSION: Band members showed no evidence of STS or persistent notched audiograms. Because accepted procedures for measuring hearing showed a lack of precision in reliably detecting early NIHL in marching band members, it is recommended that signs of NIHL be sought in repeated measurements compared to baseline audiograms rather than in a single measure (a single notch). A hearing conservation program for this population is still recommended because of lengthy rehearsal times with high sound-level exposure during rehearsals."
"23782715","Efficient hearing screening in noise-exposed listeners using the digit triplet test.","OBJECTIVES: Hearing screening in occupational medicine is generally based on pure-tone threshold audiometry. However, reliable and valid thresholds can only be obtained in a sound-proof room, using a high-quality, well-calibrated audiometer, and by a well-trained administrator. Thresholds also need to be determined for several audiometric frequencies. This makes the test time-consuming and expensive, which is not ideal for the screening of large populations. A Speech-In-Noise test (SPIN), by contrast, does not have the abovementioned requirements. Because it can be implemented as a quick automated self-test, possibly over the Internet, a SPIN test is highly advantageous for screening purposes. However, its sensitivity for (isolated) high-frequency hearing loss, as typically seen in noise-exposed listeners, was unclear up to present. In this study, the authors investigated the sensitivity and specificity of the Digit Triplet SPIN test for detecting and monitoring (early-stage) high-frequency hearing loss, and its similarity across two different language versions.DESIGN: One-hundred eighteen noise-exposed workers, representing a wide range from no to severe high-frequency hearing loss, completed the French or Dutch version of the broadband Digit Triplet self-test in an office-like room. Pure-tone thresholds, collected by a professional audiologist in favorable settings, served as the reference.RESULTS: The 84 Dutch-speaking participants showed a very strong linear relation between the reference and the Digit Triplet test, with the pure-tone average at 2, 3, 4, and 6 kHz as a strong predictor (R = 0.86) for the speech-reception threshold. The sensitivity and specificity to detect mild high-frequency hearing loss were 92% (61 of 66) and 89% (16 of 18), respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was very high (=0.91) for several degrees of high-frequency hearing loss. With a within-subject standard deviation of only 0.8 dB, the Digit Triplet test also had a low measurement error. The results of the 34 French-speaking subjects showed a highly similar trend.CONCLUSIONS: The Digit Triplet test proves to have a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting different degrees of high-frequency hearing loss. Given its ease of use, this test is very suitable for screening purposes in occupational medicine, and potentially for the screening of adolescents at risk of recreational noise-induced hearing loss."
"23772828","The applicability of a speech-in-noise screening test in occupational hearing conservation.","OBJECTIVE: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is the most reported occupational health disease in the Netherlands. The internet-based speech-in-noise test Earcheck (Albrecht et al, 2005; Leensen et al, 2011b) is designed to detect beginning NIHL and can be a valuable tool in occupational hearing health surveillance. The aim of this study is to investigate the validity of Earcheck compared to regular screening audiometry.DESIGN: Subjects performed online Earcheck tests at home. The results are compared to a pure-tone screening audiogram obtained during regular occupational health examination. A subgroup performed the measurements twice to assess test-retest reliability.STUDY SAMPLE: Two hundred and forty-nine male construction employees who recently had a periodic occupational health examination participated.RESULTS: An average learning effect of -1.6 dB was found, that reduced with increasing test number. The test-retest variability was 1.6 dB. Sensitivity to detect beginning NIHL was 68%, with a specificity of 71%.CONCLUSIONS: Although sensitivity and specificity values are only moderate, the broad internet application still promises a valuable addition to current practice. The relatively high learning effect indicates that more reliable results can be obtained after a longer test session. When this is put into practice some improvement in sensitivity and specificity may be expected as well."
"23771423","Auditory risk assessment of college music students in jazz band-based instructional activity.","It is well-known that musicians are at risk for music-induced hearing loss, however, systematic evaluation of music exposure and its effects on the auditory system are still difficult to assess. The purpose of the study was to determine if college students in jazz band-based instructional activity are exposed to loud classroom noise and consequently exhibit acute but significant changes in basic auditory measures compared to non-music students in regular classroom sessions. For this we (1) measured and compared personal exposure levels of college students (n = 14) participating in a routine 50 min jazz ensemble-based instructional activity (experimental) to personal exposure levels of non-music students (n = 11) participating in a 50-min regular classroom activity (control), and (2) measured and compared pre- to post-auditory changes associated with these two types of classroom exposures. Results showed that the L eq (equivalent continuous noise level) generated during the 50 min jazz ensemble-based instructional activity ranged from 95 dBA to 105.8 dBA with a mean of 99.5 ± 2.5 dBA. In the regular classroom, the L eq ranged from 46.4 dBA to 67.4 dBA with a mean of 49.9 ± 10.6 dBA. Additionally, significant differences were observed in pre to post-auditory measures between the two groups. The experimental group showed a significant temporary threshold shift bilaterally at 4000 Hz (P &lt; 0.05), and a significant decrease in the amplitude of transient-evoked otoacoustic emission response in both ears (P &lt; 0.05) after exposure to the jazz ensemble-based instructional activity. No significant changes were found in the control group between pre- and post-exposure measures. This study quantified the noise exposure in jazz band-based practice sessions and its effects on basic auditory measures. Temporary, yet significant, auditory changes seen in music students place them at risk for hearing loss compared to their non-music cohorts."

Out of these workers, 165 and another control group of 57 participants were assessed by formal audiometry. Audiometric tests were conducted at frequencies of 1.0 KHz to 8.0 KHz.The occurrence of hearing loss was determined on the basis of a hearing threshold level with a low fence of 25 dB. Student's test and ANOVA were used to compare the various groups; a p value &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTS: More than 90% of the workers sampled showed significant hearing loss at medium and high frequencies. The analyses revealed a higher prevalence of significant hearing loss among the forging workers compared with the workers associated with the other activities.CONCLUSIONS: The workers of the Indian steel industry are highly exposed to occupational noise. The majority of workers are not protected from noise-induced hearing loss. There is a need to provide special ear protectors for workers engaged in forging. A complete hearing protection program, including training, audiometry, job rotation, and the use of hearing protection devices, needs to be introduced."

"23474376","Hearing risk associated with the usage of personal listening devices among urban high school students in Malaysia.","OBJECTIVES: To investigate listening habits and hearing risks associated with the use of personal listening devices among urban high school students in Malaysia.STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional, descriptive study.METHODS: In total, 177 personal listening device users (13-16 years old) were interviewed to elicit their listening habits (e.g. listening duration, volume setting) and symptoms of hearing loss. Their listening levels were also determined by asking them to set their usual listening volume on an Apple iPod TM playing a pre-selected song. The iPod's sound output was measured with an artificial ear connected to a sound level meter. Subjects also underwent pure tone audiometry to ascertain their hearing thresholds at standard frequencies (0.5-8 kHz) and extended high frequencies (9-16 kHz).RESULTS: The mean measured listening level and listening duration for all subjects were 72.2 dBA and 1.2 h/day, respectively. Their self-reported listening levels were highly correlated with the measured levels (P &lt; 0.001). Subjects who listened at higher volumes also tend to listen for longer durations (P = 0.012). Male subjects listened at a significantly higher volume than female subjects (P = 0.008). When sound exposure levels were compared with the recommended occupational noise exposure limit, 4.5% of subjects were found to be listening at levels which require mandatory hearing protection in the occupational setting. Hearing loss (=25 dB hearing level at one or more standard test frequencies) was detected in 7.3% of subjects. Subjects' sound exposure levels from the devices were positively correlated with their hearing thresholds at two of the extended high frequencies (11.2 and 14 kHz), which could indicate an early stage of noise-induced hearing loss.CONCLUSIONS: Although the average high school student listened at safe levels, a small percentage of listeners were exposed to harmful sound levels. Preventive measures are needed to avoid permanent hearing damage in high-risk listeners."

Pure tone audiometry at 0.25-2 kHz, 4 kHz, and 8 kHz was calculated for all individuals pre- and postoperatively ipsilateral and contralaterally. Intraoperative neurophysiological data were reviewed independently. An HFHL was defined as a change in pure tone audiometry of more than 10 dB at frequencies of 4 and 8 kHz.RESULTS: The incidence of HFHL was 50.00% and 25.53% ipsilateral and contralateral to the side of surgery, respectively. The incidence of HFHL adjusted for conductive and nonserviceable hearing loss was 26.6% ipsilaterally. The incidence of HFHL at 4 and 8 kHz on the ipsilateral side was 37.23% and 45.74%, respectively, and it was 10.64% and 25.53%, respectively, on the contralateral side. Maximal change in interpeak latency Waves I-V compared with baseline was the only variable significantly different between groups (p &lt; 0.05). Sex, age, and side did not increase the risk of HFHL. Stepwise logistic regression analysis did not find any changes in intraoperative BAEPs to increase the risk of HFHL.CONCLUSIONS: High-frequency hearing loss occurs in a significant number of patients following MVD surgery for HFS. Drill-induced noise and transient loss of CSF during surgery may impair hearing in the high-frequency ranges on both the ipsilateral and contralateral sides, with the ipsilateral side being more affected. Changes in intraoperative BAEPs during MVD for HFS were not useful in predicting HFHL. Follow-up studies and repeat audiological examinations may be helpful in evaluating the time course and prognosis of HFHL. Prospective studies focusing on decreasing intraoperative noise exposure, as well as auditory shielding devices, will establish causation and allow the team to intervene appropriately to decrease the risk of HFHL."
"23369841","Effects of chronic noise exposure on speech-in-noise perception in the presence of normal audiometry.","OBJECTIVE: To assess auditory processing in noise-exposed subjects with normal audiograms and compare the findings with those of non-noise-exposed normal controls.METHODS: Ten noise-exposed Royal Air Force aircrew pilots were compared with 10 Royal Air Force administrators who had no history of noise exposure. Participants were matched in terms of age and sex. The subjects were assessed in terms of: pure tone audiometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions, suppression of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions in contralateral noise and auditory processing task performance (i.e. masking, frequency discrimination, auditory attention and speech-in-noise).RESULTS: All subjects had normal pure tone audiometry and transient evoked otoacoustic emissions amplitudes in both ears. The noise-exposed aircrew had similar pure tone audiometry thresholds to controls, but right ear transient evoked otoacoustic emissions were larger and speech-in-noise thresholds were elevated in the noise-exposed subjects compared to controls.CONCLUSION: The finding of poorer speech-in-noise perception may reflect noise-related impairment of auditory processing in retrocochlear pathways. Audiometry may not detect early, significant noise-induced hearing impairment."
"23324255","Auditory dysfunction associated with solvent exposure.","BACKGROUND: A number of studies have demonstrated that solvents may induce auditory dysfunction. However, there is still little knowledge regarding the main signs and symptoms of solvent-induced hearing loss (SIHL). The aim of this research was to investigate the association between solvent exposure and adverse effects on peripheral and central auditory functioning with a comprehensive audiological test battery.METHODS: Seventy-two solvent-exposed workers and 72 non-exposed workers were selected to participate in the study. The test battery comprised pure-tone audiometry (PTA), transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE), Random Gap Detection (RGD) and Hearing-in-Noise test (HINT).RESULTS: Solvent-exposed subjects presented with poorer mean test results than non-exposed subjects. A bivariate and multivariate linear regression model analysis was performed. One model for each auditory outcome (PTA, TEOAE, RGD and HINT) was independently constructed. For all of the models solvent exposure was significantly associated with the auditory outcome. Age also appeared significantly associated with some auditory outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence of the possible adverse effect of solvents on the peripheral and central auditory functioning. A discussion of these effects and the utility of selected hearing tests to assess SIHL is addressed."
"25549167","Short-term music-induced hearing loss after sound exposure to discotheque music: the effectiveness of a break in reducing temporary threshold shift.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a break in music exposure on temporary threshold shifts.DESIGN: A cross-over design where subjects are exposed to dance music for either two hours consecutively, or exposed to two hours of dance music with a one-hour break in between. Outcome measure was the change in hearing threshold, measured in 1-dB steps at different time points after ending the music.STUDY SAMPLE: Eighteen normal-hearing subjects participated in this study.RESULTS: Changes in pure-tone threshold were observed in both conditions and were similar, regardless of the break. Threshold shifts could be averaged for 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. The shift immediately after the ending of the music was 1.7 dB for right ears, and 3.4 dB for left ears. The difference between left and right ears was significant. One hour after the exposure, right ears were recovered to baseline conditions whereas left ears showed a small but clinically irrelevant remaining shift of approximately 1 dB.CONCLUSIONS: The advice to use chill-out zones is still valid, because this helps to reduce the duration to the exposure. This study does not provide evidence that a rest period gives an additional reduction of temporary threshold shifts."
"25549164","Stimulus and transducer effects on threshold.","OBJECTIVE: This study examined differences in thresholds obtained under Sennheiser HDA200 circumaural earphones using pure tone, equivalent rectangular noise bands, and 1/3 octave noise bands relative to thresholds obtained using Telephonics TDH-39P supra-aural earphones.DESIGN: Thresholds were obtained via each transducer and stimulus condition six times within a 10-day period.STUDY SAMPLE: Forty-nine adults were selected from a prior study to represent low, moderate, and high threshold reliability.RESULTS: The results suggested that (1) only small adjustments were needed to reach equivalent TDH-39P thresholds, (2) pure-tone thresholds obtained with HDA200 circumaural earphones had reliability equal to or better than those obtained using TDH-39P earphones, (3) the reliability of noise-band thresholds improved with broader stimulus bandwidth and was either equal to or better than pure-tone thresholds, and (4) frequency-specificity declined with stimulus bandwidths greater than one equivalent rectangular band, which could complicate early detection of hearing changes that occur within a narrow frequency range.CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that circumaural earphones such as the HDA200 headphones provide better reliability for audiometric testing as compared to the TDH-39P earphones. These data support the use of noise bands, preferably ERB noises, as stimuli for audiometric monitoring."
"25515180","Is it reasonable to use 1 and 8 kHz anchor points in the medico-legal diagnosis and estimation of noise-induced hearing loss?","BACKGROUND: In the United Kingdom, use of 1 and 8 kHz as anchor point frequencies has been recommended for the medico-legal diagnosis and estimation of noise-induced hearing loss. There appear to be four assumptions behind the use of 1 and 8 kHz anchor point approach: (i) The frequencies of 1 and 8 kHz are not damaged by noise; therefore, the measured hearing thresholds at the said frequencies solely reflect age-related hearing loss, even in the noise-exposed; (ii) The hearing thresholds at 1 and 8 kHz are a valid predictor of the likely age-related hearing loss thresholds at the other frequencies; (iii) Age and noise damage are always completely additive; (iv) Individual's susceptibility to age and noise damage is not proportionate. Doubts have been expressed in the medical circles about the legitimacy and validity of their use as anchor points.OBJECTIVE OF REVIEW: Is it reasonable to use 1 and 8 kHz anchor points in the medico-legal diagnosis and estimation of noise-induced hearing loss?TYPE OF REVIEW: Medico-legal.SEARCH STRATEGY: Literature search; Medline, Embase, Internet, and medico-legal records.EVALUATION METHOD: Equating and comparing the assumptions in the anchor point approach with the information in medical literature.RESULTS: Based upon the information in medical literature, technical reports, and professional statements, the assumptions behind the use of anchor point approach cannot be reliably substantiated.CONCLUSIONS: 'Carte Blanche' use of 1 and 8 kHz anchor points is probably unreasonable and may well be unsafe in the medico-legal diagnosis and estimation of noise-induced hearing loss."
"25470622","Concurrent effect of noise exposure and smoking on extended high-frequency pure-tone thresholds.","OBJECTIVE: Concurrent effect of noise and smoking on hearing loss is a recent concern. In this study, the concurrent effect of noise and smoking on hearing loss in conventional frequencies and frequencies higher than 8 kHz was assessed.DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study on workers exposed to noise who were divided into two groups: smokers and non-smokers. Hearing thresholds were assessed by conventional audiometry, and HFA. Data were analysed using non-parametric tests and Student's t-test.STUDY SAMPLE: There were 212 workers.RESULTS: Ninety-seven subjects were smokers and 115 individuals were non-smokers. All subjects were exposed to 92.1 ± 2.4 dBA (Leq8h). The highest threshold in conventional and high-frequency audiometry was observed at 6 kHz and 16 kHz, respectively. Hearing threshold at frequencies above 1 kHz was significantly higher in the smokers than non-smokers. There was no correlation between hearing thresholds and pack-years of smoking.CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent exposure to noise and smoking may be associated with more hearing loss than exposure to noise alone in the conventional and high frequencies. However, other differences between smokers and non-smokers may explain these differences as well."
"25470371","The prevalence of notched audiograms in a cross-sectional study of 12,055 railway workers.","OBJECTIVE: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is one of the most reported occupational diseases internationally. The occurrence of audiometric notches is emphasized in both American and European guidelines for the diagnosis of NIHL. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of notched audiograms among railway personnel with and without noise exposure to better assess the usefulness of such notches in the diagnosis of NIHL.DESIGN: The most recent audiogram from 1994 to 2011 of a total of 12,055 railway workers, age 20 to 65 years, was obtained from the medical records of the occupational health service of the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). The prevalences of three types of notched audiograms, Coles notch, notch index, and 4 kHz notch, were computed, in relation to age, sex, and occupational noise exposure.RESULTS: Coles notch in either ear was found in 63% of the male railway maintenance workers, exposed to noise levels of 75 to 90 dB(A), compared with 53% of the non-noise exposed (&lt;70 dB(A)) traffic controllers (p &lt; 0.001). The corresponding figures for the 4 kHz notch were 31% versus 21% (p &lt; 0.001). For the notch index, 61% of the exposed and 51% of the controls had a notched audiogram (p &lt; 0.001). For female workers, the prevalence of audiometric notches was lower, and the differences between noise exposed and nonexposed was smaller than those in men. Increasing age led to an increased prevalence of notches.CONCLUSIONS: Audiometric notches commonly occur among both noise-exposed and those not exposed to noise in railway personnel. The usefulness of audiometric notches in the diagnosis of NIHL is therefore limited."
"25387537","A comparison of the effects of solvent and noise exposure on hearing, together and separately.","The objective of the present study was to assess the effects of occupational exposure to noise and organic solvents on hearing loss in bus and truck plant workers. Our case control study contained 469 workers from a bus and truck plant divided into three groups. The first group contained workers exposed to only noise; the second group contained workers exposed to both noise and mixture solvents at a permissible level; and the third group included workers exposed to permissible levels of solvents. The control group (Group 4) included 119 individuals selected randomly, persons who were not exposed to noise and solvents. These groups were compared in terms of each individual's frequency hearing loss in both ears. Our study demonstrates that combined exposure to mixed solvents and noise can exacerbate hearing loss in workers. Hence, a suitable hearing protection program is advised that would contain short-interval audiometric examinations and efficient hearing protectors. "
"25372170","Audiometric profile of civilian pilots according to noise exposure.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the audiometric profile of civilian pilots according to the noise exposure level.METHODS: This observational cross-sectional study evaluated 3,130 male civilian pilots aged between 17 and 59 years. These pilots were subjected to audiometric examinations for obtaining or revalidating the functional capacity certificate in 2011. The degree of hearing loss was classified as normal, suspected noise-induced hearing loss, and no suspected hearing loss with other associated complications. Pure-tone air-conduction audiometry was performed using supra-aural headphones and acoustic stimulus of the pure-tone type, containing tone thresholds of frequencies between 250 Hz and 6,000 Hz. The independent variables were professional categories, length of service, hours of flight, and right or left ear. The dependent variable was pilots with suspected noise-induced hearing loss. The noise exposure level was considered low/medium or high, and the latter involved periods &gt; 5,000 flight hours and &gt; 10 years of flight service.RESULTS: A total of 29.3% pilots had suspected noise-induced hearing loss, which was bilateral in 12.8% and predominant in the left ear (23.7%). The number of pilots with suspected hearing loss increased as the noise exposure level increased.CONCLUSIONS: Hearing loss in civilian pilots may be associated with noise exposure during the period of service and hours of flight."
"25335826","Prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss among woodworkers in Nepal: a pilot study.","BACKGROUND: The woodworking industry represents an important cause of occupational noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), a significant yet underappreciated problem in many developing countries.OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence of occupational NIHL among woodworkers in Nepal and measure noise levels at workplaces.METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study with 124 woodworkers (88 carpenters, 36 sawyers), recruited through convenience sampling from 26 workplaces. Pure-tone audiometry between the frequencies 0·5 and 8 kHz ascertained participants' hearing status, and noise readings were taken at selected workplaces.RESULTS: In all, 31% of carpenters and 44% of sawyers met criteria for NIHL, with 7 and 17% meeting World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for hearing impairment (HI), respectively. Noise levels at various workplaces ranged from 71·2 to 93·9 dBA.CONCLUSIONS: Woodworkers in Nepal are at risk of occupational NIHL. As the industry develops, this problem will likely become more extensive, highlighting the need for workplace interventions and additional research."
"25324318","A cross-sectional study of hearing thresholds among 4627 Norwegian train and track maintenance workers.","OBJECTIVE: Railway workers performing maintenance work of trains and tracks could be at risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss, since they are exposed to noise levels of 75-90 dB(A) with peak exposures of 130-140 dB(C). The objective was to make a risk assessment by comparing the hearing thresholds among train and track maintenance workers with a reference group not exposed to noise and reference values from the ISO 1999.DESIGN: Cross-sectional.SETTING: A major Norwegian railway company.PARTICIPANTS: 1897 and 2730 male train and track maintenance workers, respectively, all exposed to noise, and 2872 male railway traffic controllers and office workers not exposed to noise.OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the hearing threshold (pure tone audiometry, frequencies from 0.5 to 8 kHz), and the secondary outcome was the prevalence of audiometric notches (Coles notch) of the most recent audiogram.RESULTS: Train and track maintenance workers aged 45 years or older had a small mean hearing loss in the 3-6 kHz area of 3-5 dB. The hearing loss was less among workers younger than 45 years. Audiometric notches were slightly more prevalent among the noise exposed (59-64%) group compared with controls (49%) for all age groups. They may therefore be a sensitive measure in disclosing an early hearing loss at a group level.CONCLUSIONS: Train and track maintenance workers aged 45 years or older, on average, have a slightly greater hearing loss and more audiometric notches compared with reference groups not exposed to noise. Younger (&lt;45 years) workers have hearing thresholds comparable to the controls."
"25320701","Effect of exposure to a mixture of organic solvents on hearing thresholds in petrochemical industry workers.","INTRODUCTION: Hearing loss is one of the most common occupational diseases. In most workplaces, workers are exposed to noise and solvents simultaneously, so the potential risk of hearing loss due to solvents may be attributed to noise. In this study we aimed to assess the effect of exposure to mixed aromatic solvents on hearing in the absence of exposure to hazardous noise.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 99 workers from the petrochemical industry with exposure to a mixture of organic solvents whose noise exposure was lower than 85 dBA were compared with 100 un-exposed controls. After measuring sound pressure level and mean concentration of each solvent in the workplace, pure-tone-audiometry was performed and the two groups were compared in terms of high-frequency and low-frequency hearing loss. T-tests and Chi-square tests were used to compare the two groups.RESULTS: The mean hearing threshold at all frequencies among petrochemical workers was normal (below 25 dB). We did not observe any significant association between solvent exposure and high-frequency or low-frequency hearing loss.CONCLUSION: This study showed that temporary exposure (less than 4 years) to a mixture of organic solvents, without exposure to noise, does not affect workers' hearing threshold in audiometry tests."
"25303810","[Association between interleukin-6 polymorphism in the -174 G/C region and hearing loss in the elderly with a history of occupational noise exposure].","INTRODUCTION: The biological processes involved in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) are still unclear. The involvement of inflammation in this condition has been suggested.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between interleukin - 6 (IL-6) polymorphism and susceptibility to NIHL.METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with a sample of 191 independent elderly individuals aged &gt;60 years of age. Information on exposure to occupational noise was obtained by interviews. Audiological evaluation was performed using pure tone audiometry and genotyped through PCR by restriction fragment length polymorphism - PCR-RFLP. Data were analyzed using the chi-square test and the odds ratio (OR), with the significance level set at 5%.RESULTS: Among elderly with hearing loss (78.0%), 18.8% had a history of exposure to occupational noise. There was a statistically significant association between the genotype frequencies of the IL-6 -174 and NIHL. The elderly with the CC genotype were less likely to have hearing loss due to occupational noise exposure when compared to those carrying the GG genotype (OR=0.0124; 95% CI 0.0023-0.0671; p&lt;0.001).CONCLUSION: This study suggests there is an association of polymorphisms in the IL-6 gene at position - G174C with susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss."
"25287192","Hearing loss in the royal Norwegian Navy: a cross-sectional study.","OBJECTIVES: Prior studies have indicated a high prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) among Navy personnel; however, it is not clear whether this is caused by work on board. The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of hearing loss among Navy personnel in the Royal Norwegian Navy (RNoN), and to investigate whether there is an association between work on board RNoN vessels and occurrence of hearing loss.METHODS: Navy personnel currently working on board RNoN vessels were recruited to complete a questionnaire on noise exposure and health followed by pure tone audiometry. Hearing loss was defined as hearing threshold levels =25 dB in either ear at the frequencies 3,000, 4,000 or 6,000 Hz. Hearing thresholds were adjusted for age and gender using ISO 7029.RESULTS: The prevalence of hearing loss among Navy personnel was 31.4 %. The work exposure variables: years of work in the Navy, years on vessel(s) in the Navy and years of sailing in the Navy were associated with reduced hearing after adjusting for age, gender and otitis as an adult. Among the work exposure variables, years of sailing in the Navy was the strongest predictor of reduced hearing, and significantly reduced hearing was found at the frequencies 1,000, 3,000 and 4,000 Hz.CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that time spent on board vessels in the RNoN is a predictor of reduced hearing."
"25259432","[Acoustic trauma generated by exposure to gun powder].","BACKGROUND: Noise-induced hearing loss has increased due to factors such as industrialization. It is estimated that one third of the world's population suffers from some degree of hearing loss caused by exposure to high-intensity noise. Exposure to noise can cause disease of various ear structures, especially destruction of outer hair cells, causing varying degrees of hearing lossObjective: To describe the audiological findings in a group of subjects who were exposed to a source of fireworks explosion in the state of Tlaxcala Mexico.METHODOLOGY: We carried out an audiometric study in eight patients admitted to CENIAQ-INR who were exposed to a firecracker explosion. In each subject, airway with conventional pure tone audiometry from 125 to 8000 Hz was assessed using a clinical audiometer (model 622, Minimate, Madsen) Clinical case: Hearing loss at all frequencies was found in all eight patients, from mild to severe in both ears. Audiogram showed decreases from 4000 Hz, diagnosing third-degree acoustic trauma in all patients.CONCLUSIONS: The main symptom was reported by patients with tinnitus. Other scenarios in which patients report the presence of tinnitus are acoustic trauma due to use of audio players in symphony orchestra musicians and detonating military firearms. Audiometric assessment is recommended after an explosive accident as an accurate method to determine if there is any hearing impairment.Antecedentes: la pérdida auditiva inducida por ruido se ha incrementado debido a factores como la industrialización. Se estima que un tercio de la población mundial padece algún grado de hipoacusia causada por exposición a ruidos de alta intensidad. La exposición al ruido puede afectar diferentes estructuras del oído y destruir las células ciliadas externas, que provocan diferentes grados de hipoacusia. Objetivo: describir los hallazgos audiológicos encontrados en un grupo de personas expuestas a una fuente de explosión en el estado de Tlaxcala, México. Metodología: estudio transversal, descriptivo, con muestreo censal efectuado en ocho pacientes ingresados al Centro Nacional de Investigación y Atención de Quemados del Instituto Nacional de Rehabilitación, expuestos a una explosión de pólvora. En cada sujeto se evaluó la vía aérea con audiometría de tonos puros, convencional, de 125 a 8000 Hz. Se utilizó un audiómetro clínico marca Madson, modelo Midimate 622, de dos canales y audífonos THD 39. Casos clínicos: en los 8 pacientes se encontró hipoacusia en todas las frecuencias, de media a severa en ambos oídos.

"25209043","Hearing and loud music exposure in a group of adolescents at the ages of 14-15 and retested at 17-18.","Young people expose themselves to potentially damaging loud sounds while leisure activities and noise induced hearing loss is diagnosed in increasing number of adolescents. Hearing and music exposure in a group of adolescents of a technical high school was assessed at the ages of: 14-15 (test) and 17-18 (retest). The aims of the current study were: (1) To compare the auditory function between test and retest; (2) to compare the musical exposure levels during recreational activities in test and retest; (3) to compare the auditory function with the musical exposure along time in a subgroup of adolescents. The participants in the test were 172 male; in the retest, this number was reduced to 59. At the test and retest the conventional and extended high frequency audiometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) and recreational habits questionnaire were performed. In the test, hearing threshold levels (HTLs) were classified as: Normal (Group 1), slightly shifted (Group 2), and significantly shifted (Group 3); the Musical General Exposure (MGE), categorized in: Low, moderate, high, and very high exposure. The results revealed a significant difference (P &lt; 0.0001) between test and retest in the HTL and global amplitude of TEOAEs in Group 1, showing an increase of the HTL and a decrease TEOAEs amplitude. A subgroup of adolescents, with normal hearing and low exposure to music in the test, showed an increase of the HTL according with the categories of MGE in the retest. To implement educational programs for assessing hearing function, ear vulnerability and to promote hearing health, would be advisable. "
"25209042","Hearing and loud music exposure in 14-15 years old adolescents.","Adolescent exposure to loud music has become a social and health problem whose study demands a holistic approach. The aims of the current study are: (1) To detect early noise-induced hearing loss among adolescents and establish its relationship with their participation in musical recreational activities and (2) to determine sound immission levels in nightclubs and personal music players (PMPs). The participants consisted in 172 14-15 years old adolescents from a technical high school. Conventional and extended high frequency audiometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions and questionnaire on recreational habits were administered. Hearing threshold levels (HTLs) were classified as: normal (Group 1), slightly shifted (Group 2), and significantly shifted (Group 3). The musical general exposure (MGE), from participation in recreational musical activities, was categorized in low, moderate, and high exposure. The results revealed an increase of HTL in Group 2 compared with Group 1 (P &lt; 0.01), in Group 3 compared with Group 2 (P &lt; 0.05) only in extended high frequency range, in Group 3 compared with Group 1 (P &lt; 0.01). Besides, a decrease in mean global amplitude, reproducibility and in frequencies amplitude in Group 2 compared with Group 1 (P &lt; 0.05) and in Group 3 compared with Group 1 (P &lt; 0.05). A significant difference (P &lt; 0.05) was found in Group 1's HTL between low and high exposure, showing higher HTL in high exposure. The sound immission measured in nightclubs (107.8-112.2) dBA and PMPs (82.9-104.6) dBA revealed sound levels risky for hearing health according to exposure times. It demonstrates the need to implement preventive and hearing health promoting actions in adolescents. "
"25209040","Amplitude variation in calibrated audiometer systems in clinical simulations.","Manual pure tone audiometry is considered to be the gold standard for the assessment of hearing thresholds and has been in consistent use for a long period of time. An increased legislative requirement to monitor and screen workers, and an increasing amount of legislation relating to hearing loss is putting greater reliance on this as a tool. There are a number of questions regarding the degree of accuracy of pure tone audiometry when undertaken in field conditions, particularly relating to the difference in conditions between laboratory calibration and clinical or industrial screening use. This study analyzed the output sound pressure level of four different commercial audiometers, all using TDH39 headphones and each of which had recently undergone calibration at an appropriate laboratory. Levels were measured using a Bruël and Kjaer Head and Torso simulator, which accurately replicates the size and shape of a human head, including the ears. A clinical environment was simulated by a trained audiometrist replacing the headphones for each test. Tests were undertaken at three presentation levels, and at the frequencies of 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 4 kHz and 6 kHz. The results showed a high level of test-retest variability, both between different audiometers and within the same audiometer. Maximum variation of sound pressure level at the ear for the same tone presentation was 21 decibels, with a particularly high level of variation at 6 kHz for all meters. An audiometer with attenuating cups exhibited significantly higher variation than ones using supral-aural headphones. Overall the variation exhibited suggests that there is a higher degree of potential error with screening pure tone audiometry than is commonly assumed and that results particularly at the 6 kHz frequency need to be assessed carefully alongside other methods such as speech audiometry.

"25205300","3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging noise in standard head and neck sequence does not cause temporary threshold shift in high frequency.","High acoustic noise level is one of the unavoidable side effects of 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A case of hearing loss after 3 T MRI has been reported in this institution and hence this study. The objective of this study was to determine whether temporary threshold shift (TTS) in high frequency hearing occurs in patients undergoing 3 T MRI scans of the head and neck. A total of 35 patients undergoing head and neck 3 T MRI for various clinical indications were tested with pure tone audiometry in different frequencies including high frequencies, before and after the MRI scan. Any threshold change from the recorded baseline of 10 dB was considered significant. All patients were fitted with foamed 3 M earplugs before the procedure following the safety guidelines for 3 T MRI. The mean time for MRI procedure was 1,672 s (range 1,040-2,810). The noise dose received by each patient amounted to an average of 3,906.29% (1,415-9,170%). The noise dose was derived from a normograph used by Occupational Noise Surveys. This was calculated using the nomograph of L eq, L EX, noise dose and time. There was no statistically significant difference between the hearing threshold before and after the MRI procedures for all the frequencies (paired t test, P &gt; 0.05). For patients using 3 M foamed earplugs, noise level generated by 3 T MRI during routine clinical sequence did not cause any TTS in high frequency hearing."
"25188429","Noise-induced hearing loss: an occupational medicine perspective.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Up to 30 million workers in the United States are exposed to potentially detrimental levels of noise. Although reliable medications for minimizing or reversing noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) are not currently available, NIHL is entirely preventable. The purpose of this article is to review the epidemiology and pathophysiology of occupational NIHL. We will focus on at-risk populations and discuss prevention programs. Current prevention programs focus on reducing inner ear damage by minimizing environmental noise production and through the use of personal hearing protective devices.RECENT FINDINGS: NIHL is the result of a complex interaction between environmental factors and patient factors, both genetic and acquired. The effects of noise exposure are specific to an individual. Trials are currently underway evaluating the role of antioxidants in protection from, and even reversal of, NIHL.SUMMARY: Occupational NIHL is the most prevalent occupational disease in the United States. Occupational noise exposures may contribute to temporary or permanent threshold shifts, although even temporary threshold shifts may predispose an individual to eventual permanent hearing loss. Noise prevention programs are paramount in reducing hearing loss as a result of occupational exposures."
"25144250","The leisure-noise dilemma: hearing loss or hearsay? What does the literature tell us?","The authors undertook a review of the literature, focussing on publications describing the following: (1) Pure tone threshold data for adolescents/young adults; (2) Measurements/estimates of noise exposure from leisure activities; and (3) The relationship between hearing threshold levels (HTLs) and leisure-noise exposure. There is a large volume of published materials relevant to these topics, and opinion among authors regarding the relationship between leisure-noise exposure and HTLs varies significantly. At one extreme is the view that the effects of leisure-noise are minimal. The opposing belief is that as a direct result of leisure-noise exposure, significant HTL shifts and possibly significant hearing disability are occurring in a large (and increasing) proportion of young people. It has been claimed that behaviors relating to leisure-noise are &quot;as threatening to young people's health as more traditional risk behaviors&quot; (, p. 55). This view has been reiterated by the popular media. This review revealed that while sufficient data confirm that some leisure pursuits provide potentially hazardous noise levels, the nature of the exposure-injury relationship for leisure-noise is yet to be determined. Specific information about the quality-of-life effects of threshold shift related to leisure-noise exposure is also lacking. The scope and limitations of a large sample of relevant publications and an overview of the methodological issues in this area of research are briefly presented. Considerations for future research are raised. "
"25033789","Comparison of the effects of N-acetyl-cysteine and ginseng in prevention of noise induced hearing loss in male textile workers.","Previous studies revealed the role of antioxidant agents in prevention of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL). The aim of this study was to compare the protective effect of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and ginseng on protection of NIHL in textile workers exposed to continuous noise in daily working. In this study, 48 participants were randomly allocated to three groups; Group I received NAC 1200 mg/day, Group II received ginseng 200 mg/day, and Group III (control group) received no supplement. Pure tone audiometry and high frequency audiometry were performed preshift before and after 14 days (on day 15). Linear regression analysis results showed reduced noise-induced temporary threshold shift (TTS) for NAC and ginseng groups at 4, 6 and 16 kHz (P &lt; 0.001) in both ears.

Further studies are needed to prove antioxidants benefits in hearing conservation programs. "
"25000107","Angiotensin-converting enzyme gene polymorphisms and hypertension in occupational noise exposure in Egypt.","BACKGROUND: The gene-environment interaction in the pathogenesis of hypertension has not been extensively studied in occupational noise.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between noise and hypertension in Egyptian workers, the interaction of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphisms as modifiers, and the possible relationship between noise hearing impairment and hypertension.METHODS: Study subjects were divided into two groups depending on noise exposure level. The control group (n<U+200A>=<U+200A>161) was exposed to noise intensity &lt;85 dB and the exposed group (n<U+200A>=<U+200A>217) was exposed to noise intensity <U+2267>85 dB. A polymerase chain reaction was used to differentiate the various genotypes of ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) and ACE G2350A.RESULTS: Noise significantly increased the likelihood of hypertension. Carriers of the genotypes AG, GG, and DD were vulnerable to hypertension on noise exposure. No association between hypertension and hearing impairment or noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) was found.CONCLUSION: Our results support the association between ACE gene polymorphisms and occurrence of hypertension in noise-exposed workers."
"24953884","Occupational hearing loss of market mill workers in the city of Accra, Ghana.","Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) is an irreversible sensorineural hearing loss associated with exposure to high levels of excessive noise. Prevention measures are not well established in developing countries. This comparative cross sectional study aims to determine the prevalence of hearing loss in both a group of high risk workers and a control group and to assess their knowledge of the effects of noise on hearing health. A total of 101 market mill workers and 103 controls employed within markets in the city of Accra, Ghana, were evaluated using a structured questionnaire and pure tone audiometry. The questionnaire assessed factors including self-reported hearing loss, tinnitus, knowledge on the effects of noise on hearing health and the use of hearing protective devices. Pure tone audiometric testing was conducted for both mill workers and controls. Noise levels at the work premises of the mill workers and controls were measured. Symptoms of hearing loss were reported by 24 (23.76%) and 8 (7.7%) mill workers and controls respectively. Fifty-five (54.5%) and fifty-four (52.37%) mill workers and controls exhibited knowledge of the effects of noise on hearing health. Five (5.0%) mill workers used hearing protective devices. There was significant sensorineural hearing loss and the presence of a 4 kHz audiometric notch among mill workers when compared with controls for the mean thresholds of 2 kHz, 3 kHz and 4 kHz (P = 0. 001). The prevalence of hearing loss in the better hearing ears of the mill workers and controls was 24.8% and 4.8% respectively (P &lt; 0.5). The prevalence of hearing loss, which may be characteristic of NIHL in the better hearing ears of the mill workers and controls was 24.8% and 4.8% respectively. The majority of mill workers did not use hearing protection. "
"24923465","High-frequency hearing thresholds: effects of age, occupational ultrasound and noise exposure.","PURPOSE: It has been suggested that high-frequency audiometry (HFA) could represent a useful preventive measure in exposed workers. The aim was to investigate the effects of age, ultrasound and noise on high-frequency hearing thresholds.METHODS: We tested 24 industrial ultrasound-exposed subjects, 113 industrial noise-exposed subjects and 148 non-exposed subjects. Each subject was tested with both conventional-frequency (0.125-8 kHz) and high-frequency (9-18 kHz) audiometry.RESULTS: The hearing threshold at high frequency deteriorated as a function of age, especially in subjects more than 30 years old. The ultrasound-exposed subjects had significantly higher hearing thresholds than the non-exposed ones at the high frequencies, being greatest from 10 to 14 kHz. This hearing loss was already significantly evident in subjects with exposure &lt;5 years and increased with years of exposure and advancing age. The noise exposure group had significantly higher hearing thresholds than the non-exposed group at the conventional frequencies 4 and 6 kHz and at the high frequency of 14 kHz. After stratification for age, there was a significant difference between the two groups at 9-10 and 14-15 kHz only for those under 30 years of age.CONCLUSION: Multivariate analysis indicated that age was the primary predictor, and noise and ultrasound exposure the secondary predictors of hearing thresholds in the high-frequency range. The results suggest that HFA could be useful in the early diagnosis of noise-induced hearing loss in younger groups of workers (under 30 years of age)."

Despite regulations and preventive measures, noise-induced hearing loss is common. The current reference test is pure-tone air-conduction audiometry (PTA), but this test cannot be used to detect early hearing loss.OBJECTIVE: In this study, we assess one-day auditory fatigue using both PTA and efferent reflexes (ER) measured using DPOAEs associated with contralateral acoustic stimulation (CAS DPOAEs).DESIGN: The noise exposure history, PTA, and ER detection were performed in seven different companies where the L(EX,8h) was 85 dB(A). Hearing was tested before and at the end of the working day.STUDY SAMPLE: Forty-six volunteers were selected to carry out this study.RESULTS: After a single working day, a greater impact of noise was measured using ER thresholds than PTA or DPOAEs. ER measurements are objective, easy to perform, and do not require a sound-attenuated booth.CONCLUSION: Screening workers by periodically measuring ER thresholds using CAS DPOAEs helps detect early changes in hearing status, before the onset of noise-induced hearing loss. These tests can be readily applied as part of a hearing conservation program."

"24708640","Using prophylactic antioxidants to prevent noise-induced hearing damage in young adults: a protocol for a double-blind, randomized controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: During leisure activities young people are often exposed to excessive noise levels resulting in an increase of noise-induced symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus and hyperacusis. Noise-induced tinnitus is often perceived after loud music exposure and provides an important marker for overexposure as a temporary threshold shift that is often not experienced by the individual itself. As oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of noise-induced hearing loss, the use of antioxidants to prevent hearing damage has recently become the subject of research.METHODS: This study proposes a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial to assess the effects of a prophylactic combination of N-acetylcysteine (600 mg) and magnesium (200 mg) prior to leisure noise exposure in young adults. The primary outcome measure is the tinnitus loudness scored by a visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary outcome measures are the differences in audiological measurements for the antioxidant treatments compared to placebo intake. Audiological testing comprising of pure tone audiometry including frequencies up to 16 kHz, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions and speech-in-noise testing will be performed prior to and within 7 hours after noise exposure. By use of a mixed effects statistical model, the effects of antioxidants compared to placebo intake will be assessed.DISCUSSION: As adolescents and young adults often do not use hearing protection while being exposed to loud music, the use of preventive antioxidant intake may provide a useful and harmless way to prevent noise-induced hearing damage in this population. Furthermore, when exposed to hazardous noise levels the protection provided by hearing protectors might not be sufficient to prevent hearing damage and antioxidants may provide additive otoprotective effects. Previous research mainly focused on occupational noise exposure. The present study provides a protocol to assess the usefulness of antioxidants during leisure noise activities.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The present protocol is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01727492."

Prevalence and adjusted prevalence ratios for NSTS were estimated by industry. NSTS, OSTS, and OSTS-A prevalences were compared by industry.RESULTS: Twenty percent of workers had an NSTS, 14% had an OSTS, and 6% had an OSTS-A. For most industries, the OSTS and OSTS-A criteria identified 28% to 36% and 66% to 74% fewer workers than the NSTS criteria, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Use of NSTS criteria allowing for earlier detection of shifts in hearing is recommended for improved prevention of occupational hearing loss."

"24610168","Longitudinal changes in hearing threshold levels of noise-exposed construction workers.","PURPOSE: Longitudinal analysis of audiometric data of a large population of noise-exposed workers provides insight into the development of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) as a function of noise exposure and age, particularly during the first decade of noise exposure.METHODS: Data of pure-tone audiometry of 17,930 construction workers who underwent periodic occupational hearing screening at least twice during a 4-year period were available for analysis. These concerned all follow-up measurements of the baseline cohort described by Leensen et al. (Int Arch Occup Environ Health 84:577-590, 2011). Linear mixed models explored the relationship between the annual rate of change in hearing and noise exposure level, exposure duration, and age. Data of 3,111 workers who were tested on three occasions were used to investigate the pattern of hearing loss development.RESULTS: The mean annual deterioration in hearing in this study population was 0.54 dB/yr, and this became larger with increasing noise exposure level and increasing age. Remarkably, during the first decade of noise exposure, an improvement in hearing threshold levels (HTLs) was observed. The change in hearing over three measurements showed a concave development of hearing loss as a function of time, which corresponds to NIHL development.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, hearing deteriorated over the measurement period. Because HTLs at follow-up were better than those obtained at baseline, no statement can be made about the NIHL development during the first decade of noise exposure. This improvement in HTLs rather resembles the result of measurement variation in occupational screening audiometry than an actual improvement in hearing ability."

This study used a controlled laboratory-based TTS paradigm that incorporated impulsive stimuli into the exposure protocol; development of this model could provide a novel platform for assessing proposed therapeutics.DESIGN: Participants played a video game that delivered gunfire-like sound through headphones as part of a target practice game. Effects were measured using audiometric threshold evaluations and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). The sound level and number of impulses presented were sequentially increased throughout the study.STUDY SAMPLE: Participants were normal-hearing students at the University of Florida who provided written informed consent prior to participation.RESULTS: TTS was not reliably induced by any of the exposure conditions assessed here. However, there was significant individual variability, and a subset of subjects showed TTS under some exposure conditions.CONCLUSIONS: A subset of participants demonstrated reliable threshold shifts under some conditions.

Five measurement visits were completed by participants within 14 days.RESULTS: The 50% critical difference boundaries were - 5 and 0 dB at 4 kHz and below and - 5 and 5 dB at 6 and 8 kHz. The likelihood of spurious notches due to test-retest variability was substantially lower than the likelihood of failing to detect a notched configuration when present. Correlates of variability included stimulus frequency, baseline threshold, acoustic reflectance of the ear, average noise exposure during the previous eight hours, age, and the tester's level of education in audiology.CONCLUSION: The short-term variability in 8-kHz pure-tone thresholds obtained with the TDH-39P earphone was slightly greater than at other frequencies, but this difference was not large enough to justify the disadvantages stemming from the inability to detect a 6-kHz notch."

On each trial, either wearing a device or with open ears, subjects walked along a 3000-foot line of discrete distance markers toward the auditory threat, which was not visible but still within line-of-sight over flat terrain, stopping to listen when instructed. On approach to the threat, the linear distance at first detection was measured, followed by a continued approach until positive identification occurred. Then the subject reversed direction, retreating away from the threat until detection was lost.RESULTS: ANOVA and post hoc tests were applied to determine statistically-significant differences among HPEDs, TCAPS, and the open ear on the objective detection and identification distance measures.CONCLUSIONS: The results have serious implications for selection of HPDs, HPEDs, and TCAPS for applications where preservation of auditory situational awareness via the fundamental detection and identification tasks are essential."
"24549507","[Hearing research news: from the periphery to the center].","In the clinical setting, a patient's hearing level is usually quantified by determining the hearing threshold in pure tone and speech audiometry. The measurement and analysis of auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) for quantification of hearing impairment go beyond the scope of routine ENT diagnostic practice. In basic scientific studies, ABRs are commonly used to determine hearing thresholds in animal models. In the last few years, analysis of suprathreshold ABRs, particularly ABR wave I suprathreshold amplitudes, have led to the discovery and understanding of previously undetected hearing impairments in noise-induced and age-related hearing loss models. Deafferentation of inner hair cells and auditory nerve fiber degeneration were identified as pathophysiological correlates to the observed reduction in ABR wave I amplitudes. Such reductions in ABR wave 1 amplitudes could also be identified in chronic tinnitus patients with apparently normal hearing. Recent functional magnetic resonance tomography studies in humans have shown that the limbic system can influence the perception of tinnitus by interacting with an endogenous noise-cancelling system. This highlights the importance of psychotherapeutic treatment approaches for chronic tinnitus."
"25812386","The influence of jet engine noise on hearing of technical staff.","BACKGROUND: Due to high sound pressure levels (SPLs), noise produced by jet planes may be harmful to hearing of people working in their proximity. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of exposure to jet engine noise on technical staff hearing.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprised 60 men, aged 24-50 years, employed in army as technical staff and exposed to jet engine noise for 6-20 years. The control group were 50 non-noise exposed males, aged 25-51 years. Exposure to noise emitted by jet engines was evaluated. Pure-tone audiometry (PTA) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) were recorded in both groups.RESULTS: Jet engines emitted broadband noise with spectrum dominated by components in the frequency range 315-6300 Hz (1/3-octave bands). Maximum A-weighted SPL during tests reached values of approx. 120-130 dB. Consequently, engine-servicing personnel (even in the case of a single engine test) was exposed to noise (at A-weighted daily noise exposure level above 95 dB) exceeding permissible levels. Averaged audiometric hearing threshold levels of technical staff were higher (= 17 dB HL, p &lt; 0.001) than in the control group. Similarly, the DPOAE amplitude was lower (= 17 dB SPL, p &lt; 0.01) in the noise-exposed subjects compared to the non-exposed ones. Significant reduction of DPOAE levels was mainly noted for high frequencies (3-6 kHz).CONCLUSIONS: Despite the usage of hearing protection devices, both PTA and DPOAE consistently showed poorer hearing in engine-servicing personnel vs. control group."

The aim of this study was to identify the relationship between arsenic exposure and hearing loss by measuring blood arsenic concentrations and hearing among miners.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This research is a retrospective case control study. Included in the study were miners employed in a single silver mine whose blood arsenic concentrations were high. A comparison was made on the pure tone audiometry measurements taken from miners exposed only to arsenic (Group 1), those exposed to both arsenic and noise (Group 2) and a control group exposed to neither arsenic nor noise (Group 3).RESULTS: It was found that for both ears at all frequencies, the hearing level of Group 3 was better than the hearing levels of both Group 1 and Group 2. There was no correlation between the blood arsenic levels and hearing levels in both ears.CONCLUSION: This study has revealed the ototoxic effects of arsenic. As blood arsenic concentrations do not reflect long-term exposure, no correlation was identified between blood arsenic concentrations and hearing levels. Further studies will be needed to clarify the mechanisms involved in the effect of arsenic on hearing. This paper represents the largest study to date focusing on the isolated effects of arsenic on hearing through the use of a clinical auditory test."

A further objective was to assess related factors such as exposure, instrument category, and the preventive effect of hearing protection. The study was a cross-sectional survey of rock musicians selected at random from a defined cohort of musicians. A random control group was included for comparison. We recruited 111 active musicians from the Oslo region, and a control group of 40 nonmusicians from the student population at the University of TromsØ. The subjects were investigated using clinical examination, pure tone audiometry, tympanometry, and a questionnaire. We observed a hearing loss in 37.8% of the rock musicians. Significantly poorer hearing thresholds were seen at most pure-tone frequencies in musicians than controls, with the most pronounced threshold shift at 6 kHz. The use of hearing protection, in particular custom-fitted earplugs, has a preventive effect but a minority of rock musicians apply them consistently. The degree of musical performance exposure was inversely related to the degree of hearing loss in our sample. Bass and guitar players had higher hearing thresholds than vocalists. We observed a 20% prevalence of chronic tinnitus but none of the affected musicians had severe tinnitus symptomatology. There was no statistical association between permanent tinnitus and hearing loss in our sample. We observed an increased prevalence of hearing loss and tinnitus in our sample of Norwegian rock musicians but the causal relationship between musical exposure and hearing loss or tinnitus is ambiguous. We recommend the use of hearing protection in rock musicians. "

Individual pure tone audiometry thresholds were compared with distortion product otoacoustic emission amplitudes, and a correlation of these measurements was conducted.RESULTS: Pure tone audiometry threshold elevation was identified in 13 out of 16 workers. When distortion product otoacoustic emission amplitudes were compared with pure tone audiometry thresholds at matched frequencies, no evidence of a robust relationship was apparent. Seven out of 16 workers had substantial distortion product otoacoustic emissions with elevated pure tone audiometry thresholds.CONCLUSION: No clinically relevant predictive relationship between distortion product otoacoustic emission amplitude and pure tone audiometry threshold was apparent. These results do not support the replacement of pure tone audiometry with distortion product otoacoustic emissions in screening. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions at frequencies associated with elevated pure tone audiometry thresholds are evidence of intact outer hair cell function, suggesting that sites distinct from these contribute to auditory deficit following ototrauma."

Of the 1388 workers, 266 met the inclusion criteria for this study. Each subject underwent a physical examination and an otologic examination and completed a health-related questionnaire. <U+03C7> and t tests were used to examine the differences between the asymmetric and symmetric hearing loss groups.RESULTS: One hundred thirty-one subjects (49.2%) had a binaural hearing threshold difference of 15 dB or more for at least one frequency, and there was no statistically significant difference between the left and right ears. The asymmetric hearing loss group was not exposed to higher cumulative noise levels (t = 0.522, p = 0.602), and there was no dose-response relation between asymmetry and cumulative noise levels (<U+03C7> = 6.502, p = 0.165). Men were 1.849 times more likely to have asymmetry than women were (95% confidence interval, 1.051 to 3.253). Among the workers with higher high-frequency hearing thresholds, audiometric asymmetry was 1.024 times more prevalent than that among those with lower high-frequency hearing thresholds (95% confidence interval, 1.004 to 1.044).CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that occupational noise exposure contributed minimally to asymmetry, whereas sex and binaural average thresholds significantly affected audiometric asymmetry. There was no evidence that the left ears were worse than the right ears."

ISO 1999 predictions as an adjunct to clinical judgment.","BACKGROUND: Physicians and audiologists are often asked to decide whether standard threshold shifts (STSs) are work-related; epidemiological data can inform these decisions.METHODS: Predictions of ISO (2013) for both age-related and noise-induced threshold shifts, for the 2, 3, and 4 kHz average used in calculating OSHA STSs, are presented, in tables, graphs, and an Excel spreadsheet calculator. Specifically, the ISO 1999 model estimates age-related thresholds based on age and sex; it estimates noise-induced threshold shifts based on noise level and duration. It specifies that to estimate the final hearing thresholds for a person of given percentile, age, sex, and noise exposure, the expected age-related threshold is to be added to the expected noise-induced threshold shift. Examples show how these data can predict the relative contributions of aging and occupational noise to an STS.RESULTS: Early-career STSs, especially with high levels of noise exposure, are more likely to be primarily noise-induced. After the first decade of exposure, most STSs will be primarily age-related.CONCLUSION: Given a worker's age, sex, and occupational noise exposure history, ISO 1999 estimates of the expected contributions of aging and noise can supplement clinical judgment."
"26356367","The effects of a hearing education program on recreational noise exposure, attitudes and beliefs toward noise, hearing loss, and hearing protector devices in young adults.","Excessive recreational noise exposure in young adults might result in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and tinnitus. Inducing behavioral change in young adults is one of the aims of a hearing conservation program (HCP). The goal of the current study was to evaluate the effect of a hearing education program after 6 months in young adults in relation to knowledge regarding their individual hearing status. The results of a questionnaire regarding the weekly equivalent recreational noise exposure, attitudes and beliefs toward noise, and hearing loss and hearing protector devices (HPDs) were compared between both sessions. Seventy-eight young adults completed the questionnaire concerning recreational noise exposure, youth attitude to noise scale (YANS), and beliefs about hearing protection and hearing loss (BAHPHL). Their hearing status was evaluated based on admittance measures, audiometry, transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs), and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). The main analysis consisted of a mixed model analysis of variance with dependent variables of either the noise exposure or the scores on (subscales of) YANS and BAHPHL. The independent variables were hearing status and session one versus session two. There was a significant decrease in recreational noise exposure and several (sub) scales of YANS and BAHPHL between both the sessions. This behavioral change resulted in a more frequent use of HPDs in 12% of the participants. However, the behavioral change was not completely related to the knowledge of young adults' individual hearing status. To prevent hearing damage in young people, investing in HCPs is necessary, apart from regulating sound levels and its compliance at various leisure-time activities. Also, the long-term effect of HCPs and their most cost-efficient repetition rates should be further investigated. "

Based on the duration of exposure and self-estimated loudness of various leisure-time activities, the weekly and lifetime equivalent noise exposure were calculated. Subjects were categorized in groups with low, intermediate, and high recreational noise exposure based on these values. Hearing was evaluated using audiometry, transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs), and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). Mean differences in hearing between groups with low, intermediate, and high recreational noise exposure were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). There were no significant differences in hearing thresholds, TEOAE amplitudes, and DPOAE amplitudes between groups with low, intermediate, or high recreational noise exposure. Nevertheless, one-third of our subjects exceeded the weekly equivalent noise exposure for all activities of 75 dBA. Further, the highest equivalent sound pressure levels (SPLs) were calculated for the activities visiting nightclubs or pubs, attending concerts or festivals, and playing in a band or orchestra. Moreover, temporary tinnitus after recreational noise exposure was found in 86% of our subjects. There were no significant differences in hearing between groups with low, intermediate, and high recreational noise exposure. Nevertheless, a long-term assessment of young adults' hearing in relation to recreational noise exposure is needed. "

Part I: The effects of attitudes and beliefs toward noise, hearing loss, and hearing protector devices.","There is great concern regarding the development of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in youth caused by high sound levels during various leisure activities. Health-orientated behavior of young adults might be linked to the beliefs and attitudes toward noise, hearing loss, and hearing protector devices (HPDs). The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effects of attitudes and beliefs toward noise, hearing loss, and HPDs on young adults' hearing status. A questionnaire and an audiological test battery were completed by 163 subjects (aged 18-30 years). The questionnaire contained the Youth Attitude to Noise Scale (YANS) and Beliefs about Hearing Protection and Hearing Loss (BAHPHL). A more positive attitude or belief represented an attitude where noise or hearing loss is seen as unproblematic and attitudes and beliefs regarding HPDs is worse. Hearing was evaluated using (high frequency) pure tone audiometry (PTA), transient evoked and distortion product otoacoustic emissions. First, mean differences in hearing between the groups with different attitudes and beliefs were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Second, a <U+03C7>² test was used to examine the usage of HPDs by the different groups with different attitudes and beliefs. Young adults with a positive attitude had significantly more deteriorated hearing and used HPDs less than the other subjects. Hearing conservation programs (HCPs) for young adults should provide information and knowledge regarding noise, hearing loss, and HPDs. Barriers wearing HPDs should especially be discussed. Further, those campaigns should focus on self-experienced hearing related symptoms that might serve as triggers for attitudinal and behavioral changes."
"26168954","Simultaneous effects of noise exposure and smoking on OAEs.","Noise is one of the most pervasive hazardous factors in the workplace. Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is the most common disorder related to noise exposure. Smoking is probably associated with hearing loss. The simultaneous effect of noise and smoking on hearing is a recent concern. In this study, we assessed the simultaneous effect of noise and smoking on standard pure tone audiometry (PTA) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DP-OAEs). This was an historical cohort study on 224 workers exposed to noise who were divided into two groups: Smokers and nonsmokers. DP-OAE response amplitudes were assessed. Data were analyzed by SPSS software (version 19) using Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U test. One hundred and five subjects were smokers (case group) and 119 individuals were nonsmokers (control group). All the subjects were exposed to 91.08 + 2.29 dBA [time-weighted average (TWA) for an 8 h work shift]. Mean DP-OAE response amplitude at frequencies higher than 1,000 Hz was significantly higher in the smokers than the nonsmokers. This study showed that smoking can aggravate the effect of noise on hearing in DP-OAEs."
"26168951","The effect of drill-generated noise in the contralateral healthy ear following mastoid surgery: The emphasis on hearing threshold recovery time.","In mastoid surgeries, contralateral ear noise exposure is a known, identified factor leading to high-frequency hearing loss due to the wide variety of surgical devices that may be used during the surgery. However, the hearing threshold recovery time after this trauma was uncertain. The present study aimed to assess this time. In this prospective survival analysis study, 28 consecutive patients with chronic otitis media who were undergoing tympanomastoidectomy were assessed. Standard pure-tone audiometry (PTA) and distortion-product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) were measured in all contralateral ears before and 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h after the surgery. Based on the PTA postoperative hearing loss, survival rates at frequencies of 3000 Hz, 4000 Hz, 6000 Hz, and 8000 Hz were 44.4%, 36.4%, 51.7%, and 47.4%, 24 h after surgery; 11.1%, 9.1%, 10.3%, and 13.2%, 48 h after surgery; and 0%, 0%, 3.4%, and 2.6%, 72 h after surgery, respectively. Based on the PTA and DPOAE, survival rates at all frequencies were 0%, 96 h after the surgery. According to the PTA, mean hearing recovery times were 61.98 ± 26.76 h (3000 Hz), 62.73 ± 26.50 h (4000 Hz), 67.08 ± 25.90 h (6000 Hz), 70.70 ± 24.13 h (8000 Hz), and with regard to DPOAE the recovery times were 58.58 ± 28.39 h (2000 Hz), 63.32 ± 28.83 h (4000 Hz), 65.22 ± 29.13 h (6000 Hz), and 75.14 ± 22.70 h (8000 Hz), respectively. To conclude, high-frequency hearing loss usually occurs following mastoid surgeries that is mainly temporary and reversible after 72 h. "

"26045794","Identification of functional tag single nucleotide polmorphisms within the entire CAT gene and their clinical relevance in patients with noise-induced hearing loss.","OBJECTIVES: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is an important occupational disease which results from an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. More and more evidences suggested that Catalase (CAT) gene polymorphism plays an important role in the development of NIHL. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of CAT gene polymorphisms with NIHL in a case-control study.DESIGN: A total of 719 unrelated adult Chinese Han population, including 225 healthy volunteers and 494 noise-exposed workers were recruited in this study. Six tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) were genotyped using an improved multiplex ligation detection reaction technique. Subsequently, the interaction between noise exposure level and genotypes and their effect on NIHL were analyzed using logistic regression.RESULTS: Among six tSNPs, two of them (rs208679 and rs769217) were significantly associated with noise exposure level. For rs208679 recessive effect, GG genotype had a significantly increased of NIHL risk in the exposure level of &lt;85 dB; and for rs769217 dominant effect, the combined genotypes TT/TC had a significantly increased of NIHL risk in the exposure level of 85 dB~92 dB; and the haplotype A-G-T-C-A-C had a risk effect on the NIHL in the exposure level of 85 dB~92 dB. In addition, the rs769217 polymorphism could enhance the transcription activities of the CAT gene.CONCLUSIONS: This study identified CAT is a NIHL susceptibility gene when noise exposure levels are taken into account. Rs208679 and rs769217 polymorphisms might be used as relevant risk estimates for the development of NIHL in population with different noise exposure levels."
"25992147","Hearing profile of brazilian forestry workers' noise exposure.","Introduction Researchers studying the hearing health of forestry workers have revealed the presence of a noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in this population and have concluded that the vibration of the equipment, the carbon monoxide released by motors, and pesticides might also contribute to NIHL. Objective To analyze the noise exposure in the Brazilian forestry industry workers and the effects on hearing. Methods The study sample comprised 109 employees of a company that specialized in reforestation. Their participants' mean age was 35.5 years (21 to 54 years), mean tenure at the company was 3.9 years (1 to 13 years), and mean total duration of noise exposure was 12.3 years (1 to 30 years). The existing documentation reporting on the jobs risk analysis was examined, noise level was measured, and pure tone audiometry was performed in all participants. Participants were divided into three groups according to their noise exposure levels in their current job. Results Of the participants who were exposed to noise levels less than 85 dBA (decibels with A-weighting filter), 23.8% had hearing loss, and 5.5% of the participants who were exposed to noise ranging from 85 to 89.9 dBA and 11% of the participants who were exposed to noise greater than 90 dBA had audiogram results suggestive of NIHL. Conclusion The implementation of a hearing loss prevention program tailored to forestry workers is needed. "
"25945769","Hearing loss associated with long-term exposure to high-speed dental handpieces.","The purpose of this study was to record and compare audiometric pure tone thresholds of dental clinicians (DCs), dental professionals (DPs), and dental students (DSs); determine the percentage of these groups who use hearing protection devices while at work in the clinic; and measure the sound intensities generated by a few representative high-speed handpieces while they are being used on patients. Participants included DCs who regularly used these handpieces (n = 16), DPs who did not use these handpieces (n = 13), and DSs (n = 8). A questionnaire was used to collect demographic information, assess occupational and recreational noise exposure, and note the level of hearing protection used. A sound level meter was used to measure the sound intensity generated by dental instruments near a clinician's ear. Results showed that DCs who regularly used high-speed handpieces had worse hearing than did members of the other study groups. These results indicate that the implementation of protective strategies should help to reduce the prevalence of occupational hearing loss among DCs. "
"25932612","The incidence of high-frequency hearing loss after microvascular decompression for trigeminal neuralgia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, or geniculate neuralgia.","OBJECT: The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and discuss the pathogenesis of high-frequency hearing loss (HFHL) after microvascular decompression (MVD) for trigeminal neuralgia (TGN), glossopharyngeal neuralgia (GPN), or geniculate neuralgia (GN).METHODS: The authors analyzed preoperative and postoperative audiogram data and brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) from 93 patients with TGN, 6 patients with GPN, and 8 patients with GN who underwent MVD. Differences in pure tone audiometry &gt; 10 dB at frequencies of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 kHz were calculated preoperatively and postoperatively for both the ipsilateral and the contralateral sides. Intraoperative monitoring records were analyzed and compared with the incidence of HFHL, which was defined as a change in pure tone audiometry &gt; 10 dB at frequencies of 4 and 8 kHz.RESULTS: The incidence of HFHL was 30.84% on the side ipsilateral to the surgery and 20.56% on the contralateral side. Of the 47 patients with HFHL, 20 had conductive hearing loss, and 2 experienced nonserviceable hearing loss after the surgery. The incidences of HFHL on the ipsilateral side at 4 and 8 kHz were 17.76% and 25.23%, respectively, and 8.41% and 15.89%, respectively, on the contralateral side. As the audiometric frequency increased, the number of patients with hearing loss increased. No significant postoperative difference was found between patients with and without HFHL in intraoperative BAEP waveforms. Sex, age, and affected side were not associated with an increase in the incidence of hearing loss.CONCLUSIONS: High-frequency hearing loss occurred after MVD for TGN, GPN, or GN, and the greatest incidence occurred on the ipsilateral side. This hearing loss may be a result of drill-induced noise and/or transient loss of cerebrospinal fluid during the course of the procedure. Changes in intraoperative BAEP waveforms were not useful in predicting HFHL after MVD. Repeated postoperative audiological examinations may be useful in assessing the prognosis of HFHL."
"25919036","Evaluation of noise-induced hearing loss by auditory steady-state and auditory brainstem-evoked responses.","OBJECTIVES: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) may result from occupational noise exposures and is considered as an 'Occupational Disease'; therefore, it is compensable. To verify the existence and severity of the work-related hearing loss, there is a need of an objective, reliable auditory measure in cases of arbitration of financial disputes to resolve any medicolegal aspects. The objective of the study was to compare between the ABR and ASSR for predicting the behavioural threshold in subjects with normal hearing or NIHL.DESIGN: The study included 82 subjects regularly exposed to high levels of occupational noise, with normal hearing and NIHL. ABR to clicks and to tone bursts were recorded followed by multiple-frequency ASSR. Physiological and behavioural thresholds were compared for specific frequencies (1000, 2000 Hz) and average of high-frequency range (2000 and 4000 Hz). In addition, Pearson correlations and the specificity and sensitivity of each measure were also calculated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.RESULTS: In the NIHL group, there was a significantly smaller difference between the behavioural threshold and click-ABR than the ASSR in high-frequency range. Pearson correlations were significantly higher for click-ABR. Analysis of specific frequencies yielded a smaller difference between behavioural and ASSR than tone-burst-ABR thresholds, with a slightly better correlation for ASSR than tone-burst-ABR. Higher sensitivity but lower specificity was suggested for ASSR than ABR.CONCLUSIONS: ASSR is associated with high-frequency specificity, shorter test sessions and good correlations with behavioural thresholds, making it a potentially better measure than ABR for predicting audiograms in subjects with NIHL. These findings have diagnostic implications, especially in cases of workers' compensation when subjects may be uncooperative."
"25906840","Total leisure noise exposure and its association with hearing loss among adolescents.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate total leisure noise exposure among adolescents and to assess its association with hearing.DESIGN: Based on self-reported time spent on 19 leisure activities and associated mean sound pressure levels reported in the literature, total leisure noise exposure was evaluated and compared to noise at work limits (&gt; 85 dB(A) = hazardous) in a cross-sectional survey. Tympanometry and pure-tone audiometry was performed in sound isolated rooms.STUDY SAMPLE: The study sample consists of 2143 pupils attending grade nine in any school in a German city 2009-2011 (mean age: 15.4 years; range: 13-19 years). Audiometric data were available for 1837 (85.8%) pupils (53.9% girls).RESULTS: 41.9% of the 2143 adolescents who had provided self-reported data on leisure activities associated with noise exposure were estimated to be hazardously exposed to leisure time noise. The interaction of gender with total leisure time noise exposure was not significant. No association between leisure time noise exposure and audiometric notches could be detected.CONCLUSION: While hearing loss seems seldom in this age group, a high proportion of adolescents aged 15-16 years are exposed to noise levels during leisure time bearing long-term risks of hearing loss."
"25620313","Efficacy and safety of N-acetylcysteine in prevention of noise induced hearing loss: a randomized clinical trial.","Despite a robust hearing conservation program, military personnel continue to be at high risk for noise induced hearing loss (NIHL). For more than a decade, a number of laboratories have investigated the use of antioxidants as a safe and effective adjunct to hearing conservation programs. Of the antioxidants that have been investigated, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has consistently reduced permanent NIHL in the laboratory, but its clinical efficacy is still controversial. This study provides a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating the safety profile and the efficacy of NAC to prevent hearing loss in a military population after weapons training. Of the 566 total study subjects, 277 received NAC while 289 were given placebo. The null hypothesis for the rate of STS was not rejected based on the measured results. While no significant differences were found for the primary outcome, rate of threshold shifts, the right ear threshold shift rate difference did approach significance (p = 0.0562). No significant difference was found in the second primary outcome, percentage of subjects experiencing an adverse event between placebo and NAC groups (26.7% and 27.4%, respectively, p = 0.4465). Results for the secondary outcome, STS rate in the trigger hand ear, did show a significant difference (34.98% for placebo-treated, 27.14% for NAC-treated, p-value = 0.0288). Additionally, post-hoc analysis showed significant differences in threshold shift rates when handedness was taken into account. While the secondary outcomes and post-hoc analysis suggest that NAC treatment is superior to the placebo, the present study design failed to confirm this. The lack of significant differences in overall hearing loss between the treatment and placebo groups may be due to a number of factors, including suboptimal dosing, premature post-exposure audiograms, or differences in risk between ears or subjects. Based on secondary outcomes and post hoc analyses however, further studies seem warranted and are needed to clarify dose response and the factors that may have played a role in the observed results.

Use of Personal Listening Devices may lead to decline in high frequency hearing sensitivity because of prolonged exposure to these devices at high volume. This study explores the changes in hearing thresholds by Extended High Frequency audiometry in users of personal listening devices.MATERIAL AND METHOD: A descriptive, hospital based observational study was performed with total 100 subjects in age group of 15-30years. Subjects were divided in two groups consisting of 30 subjects (Group A) with no history of Personal Listening Devices use and (Group B) having 70 subjects with history of use of Personal Listening Devices. Conventional pure tone audiometry with extended high frequency audiometry was performed in all the subjects.RESULT: Significant differences in hearing thresholds of Personal Listening Device users were seen at high frequencies (3kHz, 4kHz and 6kHz) and extended high frequencies (9kHz, 10kHz, 11kHz, 13kHz, 14kHz, 15kHz and 16kHz) with p value &lt;0.05. Elevated hearing thresholds were observed in personal listening devices users which were directly proportional to volume and duration of usage.CONCLUSION: In present study no significant changes were noted in hearing thresholds in PLD users before 5years of PLD use. However, hearing thresholds were significantly increased at 3kHz, 10kHz, 13kHz in PLD users having &gt;5years usage at high volume. Thus, it can be reasonably concluded that extended high frequencies can be used for early detection of NIHL in PLD users."

"27941700","The Adverse Effects of Heavy Metals with and without Noise Exposure on the Human Peripheral and Central Auditory System: A Literature Review.","Exposure to some chemicals in the workplace can lead to occupational chemical-induced hearing loss. Attention has mainly focused on the adverse auditory effects of solvents. However, other chemicals such as heavy metals have been also identified as ototoxic agents. The aim of this work was to review the current scientific knowledge about the adverse auditory effects of heavy metal exposure with and without co-exposure to noise in humans. PubMed and Medline were accessed to find suitable articles. A total of 49 articles met the inclusion criteria. Results from the review showed that no evidence about the ototoxic effects in humans of manganese is available. Contradictory results have been found for arsenic, lead and mercury as well as for the possible interaction between heavy metals and noise. All studies found in this review have found that exposure to cadmium and mixtures of heavy metals induce auditory dysfunction. Most of the studies investigating the adverse auditory effects of heavy metals in humans have investigated human populations exposed to lead. Some of these studies suggest peripheral and central auditory dysfunction induced by lead exposure. It is concluded that further evidence from human studies about the adverse auditory effects of heavy metal exposure is still required. Despite this issue, audiologists and other hearing health care professionals should be aware of the possible auditory effects of heavy metals."

Little is known about hearing loss and how it progresses in Veterans following military service. This epidemiology study is designed to evaluate and monitor a cohort of Veterans for 20 years or more to determine how hearing loss changes over time and how those changes are related to noise exposure and other ototoxic exposures encountered during military service. Data reported here are from baseline assessments of the first 100 study participants (84 males; 16 females; mean age 33.5 years; SD 8.8; range 21-58). Each participant was asked to complete a comprehensive audiologic examination and self-report questionnaires regarding sociodemographic characteristics, noise and solvent exposures, health conditions common among post-deployment Veterans, and the social and emotional consequences of hearing loss. For this relatively young cohort, 29% exhibited hearing loss, defined as average hearing threshold &gt;20 dB HL in the conventional audiometric range. Forty-two percent exhibited hearing loss in the extended-high-frequency audiometric range using the same criterion (average hearing threshold &gt;20 dB HL). Certain factors were found to be associated with poorer hearing in both conventional and extended-high-frequency ranges, including age, type of military branch, years of military service, number of military deployments, noise exposure, tinnitus, and a positive screen for post-traumatic stress disorder. Although the majority of participants had hearing within normal limits, 27% reported a self-perceived mild/moderate hearing handicap and 14% reported a significant handicap. Further research is needed to identify a cause for this discrepancy in audiologic results versus self-report. The information obtained from this longitudinal study could be used in future resource planning with the goal of preventing, as much as possible, the development of hearing loss during military service, and the exacerbation of prevalent hearing loss after military service and over Veterans' lifetimes."

"27540829","A faceoff with hazardous noise: Noise exposure and hearing threshold shifts of indoor hockey officials.","Noise exposure and hearing thresholds of indoor hockey officials of the Western States Hockey League were measured to assess the impact of hockey game noise on hearing sensitivity. Twenty-nine hockey officials who officiated the league in an arena in southeastern Wyoming in October, November, and December 2014 participated in the study. Personal noise dosimetry was conducted to determine if officials were exposed to an equivalent sound pressure level greater than 85 dBA. Hearing thresholds were measured before and after hockey games to determine if a 10 dB or greater temporary threshold shift in hearing occurred. Pure-tone audiometry was conducted in both ears at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz. All noise exposures were greater than 85 dBA, with a mean personal noise exposure level of 93 dBA (SD = 2.2), providing 17.7% (SD = 6.3) of the officials' daily noise dose according to the OSHA criteria. Hearing threshold shifts of 10 dB or greater were observed in 86.2% (25/29) of officials, with 36% (9/25) of those threshold shifts equaling 15 dB or greater. The largest proportion of hearing threshold shifts occurred at 4000 Hz, comprising 35.7% of right ear shifts and 31.8% of left ear shifts. The threshold shifts between the pre- and post-game audiometry were statistically significant in the left ear at 500 (p=.019), 2000 (p=.0009), 3000 (p&lt;.0001) and 4000 Hz (p=.0002), and in the right ear at 2000 (p=.0001), 3000 (p=.0001) and 4000 Hz (p&lt;.0001), based on Wilcoxon-ranked sum analysis. Although not statistically significant at alpha = 0.05, logistic regression indicated that with each increase of one dB of equivalent sound pressure measured from personal noise dosimetry, the odds of a = 10 dB TTS were increased in the left ear at 500 (OR=1.33, 95% CI 0.73-2.45), 3000 (OR=1.02, 95% CI 0.68-1.51), 4000 (OR=1.26, 95% CI 0.93-1.71) and 8000 Hz (OR=1.22, 95% CI 0.76-1.94) and in the right ear at 6000 (OR=1.03, 95% CI 0.14-7.84) and 8000 Hz (OR=1.29, 95% CI 0.12-13.83). These findings suggest that indoor hockey officials are exposed to hazardous levels of noise, experience temporary hearing loss after officiating games, and a hearing conservation program is warranted. Further temporary threshold shift research has the potential to identify officials of other sporting events that are at an increased risk of noise-induced hearing loss."

The present study aimed to assess differences in audiological characteristics between noise-exposed adolescents with and without NIT.METHODS: A group of 87 young adults with a history of recreational noise exposure was investigated by use of the following tests: otoscopy, impedance measurements, pure-tone audiometry including high-frequencies, transient and distortion product otoacoustic emissions, speech-in-noise testing with continuous and modulated noise (amplitude-modulated by 15 Hz), auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and questionnaires.Nineteen students reported NIT due to recreational noise exposure, and their measures were compared to the non-tinnitus subjects.RESULTS: No significant differences between tinnitus and non-tinnitus subjects could be found for hearing thresholds, otoacoustic emissions, and ABR results.Tinnitus subjects had significantly worse speech reception in noise compared to non-tinnitus subjects for sentences embedded in steady-state noise (mean speech reception threshold (SRT) scores, respectively -5.77 and -6.90 dB SNR; p = 0.025) as well as for sentences embedded in 15 Hz AM-noise (mean SRT scores, respectively -13.04 and -15.17 dB SNR; p = 0.013). In both groups speech reception was significantly improved during AM-15 Hz noise compared to the steady-state noise condition (p &lt; 0.001). However, the modulation masking release was not affected by the presence of NIT.CONCLUSIONS: Young adults with and without NIT did not differ regarding audiometry, OAE, and ABR.However, tinnitus patients showed decreased speech-in-noise reception. The results are discussed in the light of previous findings suggestion NIT may occur in the absence of measurable peripheral damage as reflected in speech-in-noise deficits in tinnitus subjects."

"27364108","[Do hearing threshold levels in workers of the furniture industry reflect their exposure to noise?].","BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to analyze the hearing status of employees of a furniture factory with respect to their exposure to noise and the presence of additional risk factors of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).MATERIAL AND METHODS: Noise measurements, questionnaire survey and assessment of hearing, using pure tone audiometry, were carried out in 50 male workers, aged 20-57 years, directly employed in the manufacture of furniture. The actual workers' hearing threshold levels (HTLs) were compared with the predictions calculated according to PN-ISO 1999:2000 based on age, gender and noise exposure.RESULTS: Workers under study were exposed to noise at daily noise exposure levels of 82.7-94.8 dB (mean: 90.9 dB) for a period of 3-14 years. In all subjects, mean HTL at 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz did not exceed 25 dB. Nevertheless, high frequency notches were found in 11% of audiograms. The actual workers' HTLs at 3000-6000 Hz were similar to those predicted using PN-ISO 1999:2000. There were statistical significant differences between HTLs in subgroups of people with higher (&gt; 78 mm Hg) and lower (= 78 mm Hg) diastolic blood pressure, smokers and non-smokers, and those working with organic solvents. Hearing loss was more evident in subjects affected by the additional risk factors specified above.CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the need to consider, in addition to noise, also some other NIHL risk factors, such as tobacco smoking, elevated blood pressure, and co-exposure to organic solvents when estimating the risk of NIHL and developing the hearing conservation programs for workers.

"27354478","Comprehensive Audiometric Analysis of Hearing Impairment and Tinnitus After Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy in Survivors of Adult-Onset Cancer.","PURPOSE: Cisplatin is widely used but highly ototoxic. Effects of cumulative cisplatin dose on hearing loss have not been comprehensively evaluated in survivors of adult-onset cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Comprehensive audiological measures were conducted on 488 North American male germ cell tumor (GCT) survivors in relation to cumulative cisplatin dose, including audiograms (0.25 to 12 kHz), tests of middle ear function, and tinnitus. American Speech-Language-Hearing Association criteria defined hearing loss severity. The geometric mean of hearing thresholds (0.25 to 12 kHz) summarized overall hearing status consistent with audiometric guidelines. Patients were sorted into quartiles of hearing thresholds of age- and sex-matched controls.RESULTS: Increasing cumulative cisplatin dose (median, 400 mg/m(2); range, 200 to 800 mg/m(2)) was significantly related to hearing loss at 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 kHz (P trends, .021 to &lt; .001): every 100 mg/m(2) increase resulted in a 3.2-dB impairment in age-adjusted overall hearing threshold (4 to 12 kHz; P &lt; .001). Cumulative cisplatin doses &gt; 300 mg/m(2) were associated with greater American Speech-Language-Hearing Association-defined hearing loss severity (odds ratio, 1.59; P = .0066) and worse normative-matched quartiles (odds ratio, 1.33; P = .093) compared with smaller doses. Almost one in five (18%) patients had severe to profound hearing loss. Tinnitus (40% patients) was significantly correlated with reduced hearing at each frequency (P &lt; .001). Noise-induced damage (10% patients) was unaffected by cisplatin dose (P = .59). Hypertension was significantly related (P = .0066) to overall hearing threshold (4 to 12 kHz) in age- and cisplatin dose-adjusted analyses. Middle ear deficits occurred in 22.3% of patients but, as expected, were not related to cytotoxic drug dosage.CONCLUSION: Follow-up of adult-onset cancer survivors given cisplatin should include routine inquiry for hearing status and tinnitus, referral to audiologists as clinically indicated, and hypertension control. Patients should be urged to avoid noise exposure, ototoxic drugs, and other factors that further damage hearing."
"27349914","Prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex vs. auditory brainstem response for hearing assessment.","The high prevalence of noise-induced and age-related hearing loss in the general population has warranted the use of animal models to study the etiology of these pathologies. Quick and accurate auditory threshold determination is a prerequisite for experimental manipulations targeting hearing loss in animal models. The standard auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurement is fairly quick and translational across species, but is limited by the need for anesthesia and a lack of perceptual assessment. The goal of this study was to develop a new method of hearing assessment utilizing prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle reflex, a commonly used tool that measures detection thresholds in awake animals, and can be performed on multiple animals simultaneously. We found that in control mice PPI audiometric functions are similar to both ABR and traditional operant conditioning audiograms. The hearing thresholds assessed with PPI audiometry in sound exposed mice were also similar to those detected by ABR thresholds one day after exposure. However, three months after exposure PPI threshold shifts were still evident at and near the frequency of exposure whereas ABR thresholds recovered to the pre-exposed level. In contrast, PPI audiometry and ABR wave one amplitudes detected similar losses. PPI audiometry provides a high throughput automated behavioral screening tool of hearing in awake animals. Overall, PPI audiometry and ABR assessments of the auditory system are robust techniques with distinct advantages and limitations, which when combined, can provide ample information about the functionality of the auditory system."
"27340983","Hearing Loss in Persons Exposed and not Exposed to Occupational Noise.","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare hearing loss in individuals at risk and those not at risk for occupational noise and to compare working loss by gender.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis used data from a current Czech Ministry of Health grant project called Epidemiological and Genetic Study of the Frequency of Hearing Loss (2011 to 2015; NT12246-5/2011). The analyzed sample comprised 4988 participants. Hearing was tested using pure-tone threshold audiometry, tympanometry, and measurement of the stapedius reflex.RESULTS: Females at risk and those not at risk for occupational noise who were younger than 44 years and older than 75 years were found to have no statistically significant differences at any pure-tone threshold audiometry frequency. In females aged 45 to 74 years, statistically significant differences were found. In males, hearing loss was observed as early as 18 years of age. When comparing males and females at no risk for occupational noise, there were no statistically significant differences at any of the frequencies in those younger than 29 years. In females aged 30 years or older, statistically significant differences were observed at various frequencies in all age groups. When comparing males and females at risk for occupational noise, statistically significant differences were more frequent than in employees not exposed to noise.CONCLUSION: Hearing loss in females does not significantly vary depending on occupational exposure. The opposite is true for males. However, the maximum differences in mean levels did not exceed 10 dB. It is therefore clear that noise is a preventable factor, and the use of personal protective equipment is warranted."

Patients were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively (1 and 7 days) following surgery using low and high-frequency pure tone audiometry (PTA) and low and high-frequency transient evoked and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) testing.RESULTS: Comparing preoperative and 1-day after surgery, PTA averages were significantly different at low frequencies, but no statistical significant differences were observed at 0.25 KHz and high-frequencies. Comparing 1-day after surgery and 7 days after surgery showed that, PTA averages at 0.5, 2 and 2 KHz were significantly different with no significant differences at the other average of thresholds in low and high frequencies; PTA average at 1 KHz was significantly different with, no significant differences at the other averages of thresholds in low and high frequencies. DPOAEs showed a significant difference preoperative and 1-day after surgery, 1-day and 7 days after, but DPOAEs were not significantly different. Transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) had a significant difference preoperative and 1-day after surgery, 1-day and 7 days after but when comparing preoperative and 7 days after surgery, TEOAEs were not significantly different.CONCLUSIONS: Drill-induced noise during ear surgery (mastoidectomy) can cause reversible changes in PTA, DPOAEs and TEOAEs in the non-operated ear."

"27221308","Personal music systems and hearing.","OBJECTIVES: To measure the output sound pressure levels of personal music systems and evaluate their effect on hearing.METHODS: Output sound pressure levels at preferred volume settings and listening environment were measured using a manikin. Effects of personal music system use on hearing were evaluated using pure tone audiometry (in conventional and extended high frequency ranges), transient evoked otoacoustic emissions, syllable identification in noise, intensity discrimination, frequency discrimination and temporal modulation transfer function.RESULTS: Results showed, alarmingly, that large proportions of young adults are using personal music systems at levels higher than the safety limits set by regulatory bodies. Individuals who listened to personal music systems at levels higher than 80 dB LAeq exhibited poorer extended high frequency thresholds, reduced transient evoked otoacoustic emission amplitudes, poorer frequency discrimination, reduced modulation detection thresholds at 32 Hz modulation frequency, and reduced syllable identification in noise at -5 dB signal-to-noise ratio.

Hearing thresholds were measured by pure tone audiometry in two consecutive examinations (n = 226). STS was defined as an average change in hearing thresholds = + 10 dB at 2,000 Hz, 3,000 Hz, and 4,000 Hz in either ear. Determinants of STS were assessed through a questionnaire. The incidence of STS was 23.0%. Significant determinants of STS were the number of episodes of temporary threshold shifts (TTS) in the Navy, exposure to continuous loud noise during work on board, and the number of gun shots (in the Navy, hunting, and sports). This study indicated a significant association between noise exposure on board Navy vessels and development of STS. "

The hazardous effects of epoxy adhesives remain unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the risk of hearing loss among workers exposed to epoxy adhesives and noise.DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.METHODS: For this cross-sectional study, we recruited 182 stone workers who were exposed to both epoxy adhesives and noise, 89 stone workers who were exposed to noise only, and 43 workers from the administrative staff who had not been exposed to adhesives or noise. We obtained demographic data, occupational history and medical history through face-to-face interviews and arranged physical examinations and pure-tone audiometric tests. We also conducted walk-through surveys in the stone industry. A total of 40 representative noise assessments were conducted in 15 workplaces. Air sampling was conducted at 40 workplaces, and volatile organic compounds were analysed using the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) TO-15 method.RESULTS: The mean sound pressure level was 87.7 dBA (SD 9.9). The prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss was considerably increased in the stone workers exposed to epoxy adhesives (42%) compared with the stone workers who were not exposed to epoxy adhesives (21%) and the administrative staff group (9.3%). A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that exposure to epoxy adhesives significantly increased the risk of hearing loss between 2 and 6 kHz after adjusting for age.

"29461742","Speech-in-noise testing as a marker for noise-induced hearing loss and tinnitus.","Speech-in-noise testing as a marker for noise-induced hearing loss and tinnitus. Noise-induced hearing loss and tinnitus are auditory complaints that often co-occur. Often, there is no immediate indication of changes in the pure tone audiogram. Patients can still have clinically normal hearing thresholds while clearly experiencing reduced speech comprehension. This might be explained by the process of neurodegeneration of the innervated dendrites of the auditory nerve fibres and secondary degeneration of spiral ganglion neurons. Subsequent maladaptive neuronal plasticity of the central auditory system can induce tinnitus. Standard hearing testing is no longer sufficient in these patients. Therefore more complex tasks, such as speech-in-noise tests, might be valuable extensions to the standard hearing tests. We carried out a prospective investigation of the influence of tinnitus upon speech comprehension in noise and the effectiveness of speech-in-noise testing, using the Flemish version of the digit triplet test (DTT). Thirty-seven patients with mild noise-induced hearing loss, tinnitus complaints and clinically normal pure tone thresholds completed the DTT and filled in two tinnitus enquiries. A statistically significant (p=0.026) correlation between the averaged high PTA, 2,z and the averaged SRT across ears on the DTT was found. There also seems to be a slight influence of tinnitus onset on the SRT score."
"29220389","Association of genetic variations in FOXO3 gene with susceptibility to noise induced hearing loss in a Chinese population.","Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL), a multifactorial disease involving both genetic and environmental factors, is one of the most important occupational health hazards. Nonetheless, the influence of FOXO3 variants on NIHL risk have not been illuminated. This research was conducted to explore the effects of FOXO3 polymorphisms on individual susceptibility to NIHL. A total of 2689 industrial workers from one textile factory of east China were recruited to participate in the current research. Venous blood was collected, questionnaire and pure-tone audiometry (PTA) was conducted by specialist physicians. Then, we performed genotyping of three selected SNPs (rs2802292, rs10457180, and rs12206094) in FOXO3 gene in 566 NIHL patients and 566 controls. Subsequently, the main effects of genotype and its interactions were evaluated. Our results revealed that individuals with the G allele of rs2802292, G allele of rs10457180, T allele of rs12206094 (OR = 1.43, 1.43, and 1.31 respectively) and the haplotype GAC and others (TGT/GGT/GGC/GAT) (rs2802292-rs10457180-rs12206094) (OR = 1.49 and 2.09 respectively) are associated with an increased risk of NIHL in a Chinese population. Stratified analysis showed that an increased NIHL risk was found in the subjects who exposed to noise &gt;16 years with rs2802292 GG/GT and rs10457180 AG/GG genotype with an OR of 1.62 and 1.66 respectively. Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis indicated that rs10457180, rs2802292, and rs12206094 have interactions and are related to increased NIHL risk (OR = 1.53). The genetic polymorphism rs2802292, rs10457180, and rs12206094 within FOXO3 gene are associated with an increased risk of NIHL in a Chinese population and have potential to be biomarkers for noise exposed workers."

Results of a 10-Year Longitudinal Study of Workers Exposed to Occupational Noise.","AIMS: To survey current, Danish industrial noise levels and the use of hearing protection devices (HPD) over a 10-year period and to characterise the association between occupational noise and hearing threshold shift in the same period. Furthermore, the risk of hearing loss among the baseline and the follow-up populations according to first year of occupational noise exposure is evaluated.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2001-2003, we conducted a baseline survey of noise- and hearing-related disorders in 11 industries with suspected high noise levels. In 2009-2010, we were able to follow up on 271 out of the 554 baseline workers (49%). Mean noise levels per industry and self-reported HPD use are described at baseline and follow-up. The association between cumulative occupational noise exposure and hearing threshold shift over the 10-year period was assessed using linear regression, and the risk of hearing loss according to year of first occupational noise exposure was evaluated with logistic regression.RESULTS: Over the 10-year period, mean noise levels declined from 83.9 dB(A) to 82.8 dB(A), and for workers exposed &gt;85 dB(A), the use of HPD increased from 70.1 to 76.1%. We found a weak, statistically insignificant, inverse association between higher ambient cumulative noise exposure and poorer hearing (-0.10<U+2009>dB hearing threshold shift per dB-year (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.36; 0.16)). The risk of hearing loss seemed to increase with earlier first year of noise exposure, but odds ratios were only statistically significant among baseline participants with first exposure before the 1980s (odds ratio: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.11; 3.22).CONCLUSIONS: We observed declining industrial noise levels, increased use of HPD and no significant impact on hearing thresholds from current ambient industrial noise levels, which indicated a successful implementation of Danish hearing conservation programs."

One hundred thirty six patients with chronic tinnitus and at least a 10 year-long working history were divided into two groups based on the risk of their profession to induce NIHL. Individuals employed in jobs at high risk for NIHL were mostly males and exhibited a poorer hearing threshold, more evident in the left ear. Tinnitus was mostly bilateral; the next largest presentation was left-sided; patients described their tinnitus as buzzing or high-pitched. Correlation between age, length of tinnitus and worse hearing was found. Patients with a higher degree of hearing impairment were mostly males and were more likely to have a family history of hearing loss and at least one cardiovascular comorbidity. Our study shows some differences in individuals with tinnitus and a history of a profession associated with increased exposure to NIHL compared to those without such a history."
"28716314","Safety and efficacy of ebselen for the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial.","BACKGROUND: Noise-induced hearing loss is a leading cause of occupational and recreational injury and disease, and a major determinant of age-related hearing loss. No therapeutic agent has been approved for the prevention or treatment of this disorder. In animal models, glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) activity is reduced after acute noise exposure. Ebselen, a novel GPx1 mimic, has been shown to reduce both temporary and permanent noise-induced hearing loss in preclinical studies. We assessed the safety and efficacy of ebselen for the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss in young adults in a phase 2 clinical trial.METHODS: In this single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial, healthy adults aged 18-31 years were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) at the University of Florida (Gainsville, FL, USA) to receive ebselen 200 mg, 400 mg, or 600 mg, or placebo orally twice daily for 4 days, beginning 2 days before a calibrated sound challenge (4 h of pre-recorded music delivered by insert earphones). Randomisation was done with an allocation sequence generated by an independent third party. The primary outcome was mean temporary threshold shift (TTS) at 4 kHz measured 15 min after the calibrated sound challenge by pure tone audiometry; a reduction of 50% in an ebselen dose group compared with the placebo group was judged to be clinically relevant. All participants who received the calibrated sound challenge and at least one dose of study drug were included in the efficacy analysis. All randomly assigned patients were included in the safety analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01444846.FINDINGS: Between Jan 11, 2013, and March 24, 2014, 83 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive ebselen 200 mg (n=22), 400 mg (n=20), or 600 mg (n=21), or placebo (n=20). Two participants in the 200 mg ebselen group were discontinued from the study before the calibrated sound challenge because they no longer met the inclusion criteria; these participants were excluded from the efficacy analysis. Mean TTS at 4 kHz was 1·32 dB (SE 0·91) in the 400 mg ebselen group compared with 4·07 dB (0·90) in the placebo group, representing a significant reduction of 68% (difference -2·75 dB, 95% CI -4·54 to -0·97; p=0·0025). Compared with placebo, TTS at 4 kHz was non-significantly reduced by 21% in the 200 mg ebselen group (3·23 dB [SE 0·91] vs 4·07 dB [0·90] in the placebo group; difference -0·84 dB, 95% CI -2·63 to 0·94; p=0·3542) and by 7% in the 600 mg ebselen group (3·81 dB [0·90] vs 4·07 dB [0·90] in the placebo group; difference -0·27, 95% CI -2·03 to 1·50; p=0·7659). Ebselen treatment was well tolerated across all doses and no significant differences were seen in any haematological, serum chemistry, or radiological assessments between the ebselen groups and the placebo group.INTERPRETATION: Treatment with ebselen was safe and effective at a dose of 400 mg twice daily in preventing a noise-induced TTS. These data lend support to a role of GPx1 activity in acute noise-induced hearing loss.FUNDING: Sound Pharmaceuticals."
"28532971","Clinical and audiological characteristics of 1000Hz audiometric notch patients.","PURPOSE: Among the hearing loss patients, we can confirm that the hearing loss of the specific frequency decreases, such as the 2000Hz notch in otosclerosis and the 4000Hz notch (c5-dip) in noise-induced hearing loss. The 1000Hz notch (c3-dip), however, is rarely studied. We fortuitously encountered a group of patients with a 1kHz hearing loss and report it with a review of the literature.METHODS: Otological history, audiogram, diagnosis, occupation, and history of noise exposure were reviewed from charts and telephone interview, and compared between c3-dip and c5-dip patients (n=98).RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (mean age: 46.2years) demonstrated 1kHz hearing loss; these included 11 males. The pure-tone threshold was 37.97dB at 1kHz and the average threshold was 22.38dB at other frequencies. In the c3-dip group, tinnitus was the most common complaint, while sudden sensorineural hearing loss and idiopathic tinnitus (n=8 each) were the most common diagnoses. Female patients and unilateral cases were more common in the c3-dip than in the c5-dip group, and ear fullness was more common in the c3-dip group than in the c5-dip group. The duration of occupation-related noise exposure was longer in the c5 group, and head or ear trauma was more frequent in the c3-dip group.CONCLUSION: We have defined a new clinical entity of 1kHz hearing loss in patients, defined as the c3-dip, which was clinically and audiologically distinct from the c5-dip. Further study is needed to clarify this new entity of hearing loss."

Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2015, in which the optimized OEC was evaluated on 94 employees from the army and three different companies in construction and manufacturing. Subjects underwent OEC in an office-like room. Pure-tone air conduction audiometry was performed as a reference test. The OEC was repeated for a subset of subjects (N=19). Important test characteristics (ie, sensitivity and specificity, test validity, and test-retest reliability) were assessed. Results When analyzed on the individual level, the sensitivity and specificity of OEC were 90% and 77%, respectively. The speech reception threshold results correlated strongly with the pure-tone average of the frequencies 3, 4 and 6 kHz, reflecting good test validity (r=0.79). The difference between test and retest was not significant. The intra-class correlation coefficient was moderate (r=0.57), indicating a reasonable agreement between test and retest. Conclusions The OEC appears to be a suitable test for the detection of high-frequency hearing loss among noise-exposed employees, with good sensitivity and specificity values, even when performed in a semi-controlled occupational setting, though a possible learning effect should be taken into account."

The control group included 67 subjects, non-music students and non-musicians, aged 22.8±3.3 years. Data on the study subjects' musical experience, instruments in use, time of weekly practice and additional risk factors for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) were identified by means of a questionnaire survey. Sound pressure levels produced by various groups of instruments during solo and group playing were also measured and analyzed. The music students' audiometric hearing threshold levels (HTLs) were compared with the theoretical predictions calculated according to the International Organization for Standardization standard ISO 1999:2013.RESULTS: It was estimated that the music students were exposed for 27.1±14.3 h/week to sounds at the A-weighted equivalent-continuous sound pressure level of 89.9±6.0 dB. There were no significant differences in HTLs between the music students and the control group in the frequency range of 4000-8000 Hz. Furthermore, in each group HTLs in the frequency range 1000-8000 Hz did not exceed 20 dB HL in 83% of the examined ears. Nevertheless, high frequency notched audiograms typical of the noise-induced hearing loss were found in 13.4% and 9% of the musicians and non-musicians, respectively. The odds ratio (OR) of notching in the music students increased significantly along with higher sound pressure levels (OR = 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.014-1.13, p &lt; 0.05). The students' HTLs were worse (higher) than those of a highly screened non-noise-exposed population. Moreover, their hearing loss was less severe than that expected from sound exposure for frequencies of 3000 Hz and 4000 Hz, and it was more severe in the case of frequency of 6000 Hz.CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the need for further studies and development of a hearing conservation program for music students.

"29889779","Occupational Noise Exposure and Risk for Noise-Induced Hearing Loss Due to Temporal Bone Drilling.","BACKGROUND: Noise-induced hearing loss is one of the most common occupational hazards in the United States. Several studies have described noise-induced hearing loss in patients following mastoidectomy. Although otolaryngologists care for patients with noise-induced hearing loss, few studies in the English literature have examined surgeons' occupational risk.METHODS: Noise dosimeters and sound level meters with octave band analyzers were used to assess noise exposure during drilling of temporal bones intraoperatively and in a lab setting. Frequency specific sound intensities were recorded. Sound produced using burrs of varying size and type were compared. Differences while drilling varying anatomic structures were assessed using drills from two manufacturers. Pure tone audiometry was performed on 7 to 10 otolaryngology residents before and after a temporal bone practicum to assess for threshold shifts.RESULTS: Noise exposure during otologic drilling can exceed over 100<U+200A>dB for short periods of time, and is especially loud using large diameter burrs &gt; 4<U+200A>mm, with cutting as compared with diamond burrs, and while drilling denser bone such as the cortex. Intensity peaks were found at 2.5, 5, and 6.3<U+200A>kHz. Drilling on the tegmen and sigmoid sinus revealed peaks at 10 and 12.5<U+200A>kHz. No temporary threshold shifts were found at 3 to 6<U+200A>kHz, but were found at 8 to 16<U+200A>kHz, though this did not reach statistical significance.CONCLUSION: This article examines noise exposure and threshold shifts during temporal bone drilling. We were unable to find previous descriptions in the literature of measurements done while multiple people drilling simultaneously, during tranlabyrinthine surgery and a specific frequency characterization of the change in peach that appears while drilling on the tegmen. Hearing protection should be considered, which would still allow the surgeon to appreciate pitch changes associated with drilling on sensitive structures and communication with surgical team members. As professionals who specialize in promoting the restoration and preservation of hearing for others, otologic surgeons should not neglect hearing protection for themselves."

"29470259","Pure-Tone Audiometry With Forward Pressure Level Calibration Leads to Clinically-Relevant Improvements in Test-Retest Reliability.","OBJECTIVES: Clinical pure-tone audiometry is conducted using stimuli delivered through supra-aural headphones or insert earphones. The stimuli are calibrated in an acoustic (average ear) coupler. Deviations in individual-ear acoustics from the coupler acoustics affect test validity, and variations in probe insertion and headphone placement affect both test validity and test-retest reliability. Using an insert earphone designed for otoacoustic emission testing, which contains a microphone and loudspeaker, an individualized in-the-ear calibration can be calculated from the ear-canal sound pressure measured at the microphone. However, the total sound pressure level (SPL) measured at the microphone may be affected by standing-wave nulls at higher frequencies, producing errors in stimulus level of up to 20 dB. An alternative is to calibrate using the forward pressure level (FPL) component, which is derived from the total SPL using a wideband acoustic immittance measurement, and represents the pressure wave incident on the eardrum. The objective of this study is to establish test-retest reliability for FPL calibration of pure-tone audiometry stimuli, compared with in-the-ear and coupler sound pressure calibrations.DESIGN: The authors compared standard audiometry using a modern clinical audiometer with TDH-39P supra-aural headphones calibrated in a coupler to a prototype audiometer with an ER10C earphone calibrated three ways: (1) in-the-ear using the total SPL at the microphone, (2) in-the-ear using the FPL at the microphone, and (3) in a coupler (all three are derived from the same measurement). The test procedure was similar to that commonly used in hearing-conservation programs, using pulsed-tone test frequencies at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 kHz, and an automated modified Hughson-Westlake audiometric procedure. Fifteen adult human participants with normal to mildly-impaired hearing were selected, and one ear from each was tested. Participants completed 10 audiograms on each system, with test-order randomly varied and with headphones and earphones refitted by the tester between tests.RESULTS: Fourteen of 15 ears had standing-wave nulls present between 4 and 8 kHz. The mean intrasubject SD at 6 and 8 kHz was lowest for the FPL calibration, and was comparable with the low-frequency reliability across calibration methods. This decrease in variability translates to statistically-derived significant threshold shift criteria indicating that 15 dB shifts in hearing can be reliably detected at 6 and 8 kHz using FPL-calibrated ER10C earphones, compared with 20 to 25 dB shifts using standard TDH-39P headphones with a coupler calibration.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that reliability is better with insert earphones, especially with in-the-ear FPL calibration, compared with a standard clinical audiometer with supra-aural headphones. However, in-the-ear SPL calibration should not be used due to its sensitivity to standing waves. The improvement in reliability is clinically meaningful, potentially allowing hearing-conservation programs to more confidently determine significant threshold shifts at 6 kHz-a key frequency for the early detection of noise-induced hearing loss."
