"11125978","Audiological problems in patients with tinnitus exposed to noise and vibrations.","Tinnitus is a hearing sensation appearing without available sound fluctuations in the external environment. It is one of the major, constant and earliest symptoms suggesting different pathology of the hearing analyser. It must be considered, though, that it is evidenced also at disturbed functions of other organs and systems of the organism. The aim of the present study is to elucidate the state of the hearing analyser in patients with tinnitus occupationally exposed to noise and vibrations in relation to therapy. The study was performed on 67 miners, aged 34-55, mean age 44.5 years. The workers with subjective tinnitus (29 persons--43% of the studied group) are the object of this investigation. They were subjected to the following tests of the hearing analyser: pure tone audiometry; above-threshold audiometry (Carhardt's adaptation test, Lusher's differential threshold, SISI test, Kietz test. The evidence reveals that the studied group of workers occupationally exposed to noise, vibrations, dust, toxic substances etc. complain predominantly of tinnitus. It is accompanied by vertigo, headache and disturbed balance. Changes in the hearing function are observed; manifested by different degree of hypacusia concerning air and bone conductivity in the pure tone audiometry. The above-threshold tests also evidence deviations suggesting disturbed hearing function. These changes can be explained by mechanical-toxic pathogenic mechanisms leading to cerebral and vestibular dysfunction most probably of vascular-circulatory type manifested by the above stated deviations. The results are the basis for the following conclusions: 1. The anamnestic profile of workers with tinnitus exposed to noise and vibrations shows a prevalent percentage of vertigo, followed by headache and disturbed balance. 2. The otoneurological profile shows changes in the air and bone conductivity manifested by different degree of hypacusia. 3. The evaluation of the above-threshold tests also confirms the evidence of disturbed hearing function. 4. The relevant therapeutical approach has to be elaborated, having in mind the existing suggestion about the mechanical-toxic etiopathogenesis of the developed process of vascular-circulatory type."
"11119634","Audiometric notch as a sign of noise induced hearing loss.","OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relation between different types of exposure to noise and a classic sign of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL), the audiometric notch.METHODS: The study sample had exposure to both continuous and impulse noise and was drawn from a population of electrical transmission workers. Audiograms, taken as part of a hearing conservation programme, were read by three clinicians experienced in the assessment of NIHL. Working independently and using their clinical judgment, they were asked to identify localised increases in the threshold of hearing (audiometric notches) which they would attribute to noise, had a suitable history of exposure been elicited. Prevalent cases of NIHL were identified by the presence of a notch in either ear. Risk factors for NIHL were assessed by a questionnaire which sought information about exposure to air blast circuit breaker noise; firearms; explosions, and continuous noise. The odds of exposure to these factors in those with and without hearing loss were calculated, and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated by logistic regression.RESULTS: Of the 648 questionnaires sent out 357 were returned, a response rate of 55%. Of these, at least two out of the three assessors identified 175 (49%) people with a notch at any audiometric frequency. There was no association between these cases and the NIHL risk factors identified by the questionnaire, but a further frequency specific analysis showed a small proportion of people (15 (4%)) with notches at 4 kHz who had the expected associations with exposure to noise and a significant OR for firearms of 4.25 (95% CI 1.28 to 14.1). The much larger proportion of people with 6 kHz notches (110 (31%)) did not show these associations.CONCLUSIONS: To diagnose NIHL it is important to elicit a detailed and accurate history of exposure to noise: although the notch at 4 kHz is a well established clinical sign and may be valuable in confirming the diagnosis, the 6 kHz notch is variable and of limited importance."
"10953818","Hearing conservation for farmers: source apportionment of occupational and environmental factors contributing to hearing loss.","Those who work on farms continue to have a strikingly high prevalence of hearing loss, despite efforts to promote hearing conservation in agriculture. To develop improved hearing conservation programs, we performed a source apportionment analysis for hearing loss in a large, multiphasic health survey, the New York Farm Family Health and Hazard Survey. We used information from audiometric, otoscopic, and tympanometric examinations; detailed general health and farm exposure interviews; and a second interview that focused on additional potential determinants of hearing loss. Hearing loss on audiometry was significantly associated with increased age, male gender, education through high school or less, lifetime years of hunting with guns, lifetime years of use of a grain dryer, and a history of spraying crops during the previous year. Hearing conservation programs for farmers should thus be directed toward reduction in noise exposure, both from occupational and non-occupational sources. Additional study is needed to evaluate the association seen between crop spraying and hearing loss."
"10894416","Influence of age and presbyacusis on DPOAE.","The influence of presbyacusis on distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) was studied on 180 ears of 96 normal-hearing subjects. The subjects' ages were distributed equally and ranged from 14 to 82 years. It was shown that there is a highly significant decrease in DPOAE amplitudes during the ageing process. By means of special statistical procedures, such as partial correlation and multiple regression, it was proved that the main reason for this is deterioration in pure-tone thresholds. However, other age-related effects were determined and were also found to lead to a further decrease in DPOAE amplitudes. The latter might be due to middle ear alterations in elderly people. Knowledge of the influence of presbyacusis on DPOAE is important if DPOAEs are to be used in expert assessment of inner ear disorders, for example, occupational noise-induced hearing loss."
"10893980","[Prevalence of hearing loss and correlated factors in a cement plant].","OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of occupational exposure to noise, as well as its relationship with other factors that can induce hearing loss.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In January and February 1997, we conducted sonometry and dosimetry tests in a cement factory, as well as audiometric test in 85 cement workers, to identify sources of noise and evaluate the effect to noise exposure and other factors, of the prevalence of occupational hearing loss. Statistical analysis was conducted using measures of central tendency, bivariate analysis and polynominal regression models.RESULTS: High noise levels were found in the crushing, crude milling, and cement milling sites. The highest individual dose corresponded to the packer job post. Fifty-five per cent of the study population presented some degree of hearing loss due to noise exposure. The cement processing area with the highest percentage of damaged workers was calcination.CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that noise is a serious risk factor in particular sites of cement factories, and also that an elevated number of hearing loss cases are due to occupational noise exposure in this industry; Our findings underscore the need for designing and implementing hearing protection programs, to assure the health and safety of cement workers."
"10821511","Effects of lead and noise exposures on hearing ability.","Lead and noise, via different mechanisms, may damage hearing ability, and, in some cases, cause severe and irreversible damage. To explore possible independent and synergistic effects of lead and noise on auditory function, the authors conducted a cross-sectional study in two lead-battery manufacturing factories. Lead and noise were the two most common sources of occupational exposures in the factories. Blood lead level, ambient lead concentration, noise exposure level, and hearing thresholds of 339 lead-battery workers-including clerical and managerial staffs-were measured. The authors obtained demographics and working histories via an interview-based structured questionnaire. A total of 220 lead-battery workers were exposed to high levels of lead and noise; their average blood lead concentration was 56.9 microg/dl, and their average noise exposure level was 86.0 dBALeq. Multivariate analysis, in which possible risk factors of hearing ability were considered, demonstrated a significant correlation between a high, long-term lead exposure index (defined by duration of employment and ambient lead concentration) and decreased hearing ability. In contrast, such a correlation between short-term lead exposure (defined by blood lead level) and hearing ability was not significant. Furthermore, neither noise exposure level alone nor the interaction between noise exposure level and short- or long-term lead exposure was correlated significantly with hearing ability. The present study raises an important, but typically ignored, issue: lead exposure might precipitate a more severe auditory than noise-exposure effect. The preservation of workers' hearing ability requires that preventive measures be taken against noise exposure, which is as essential as measures taken against lead exposure."
"10737087","[Traumatic and occupational deafness].","The frequency of accidental, traumatic hearing loss is increasing due to a sometimes violently noisy environment and to the development of sports as leisure activities. The diagnosis is based on knowledge of the circumstances of the trauma and on otoscopic examination. Total audiometry localises the damage. Occupational hearing loss forms a special subset of traumatic deafness. This trauma is usually due to intense noise occurring at the work-place. It is of insidious onset, irreversibly progressive and without treatment once under way; Prevention is based on knowledge of the deleterious effects of noise and on the individual factors of the subject at risk."
"10718677","Database for a hearing conservation program.","We have developed a database and an analysis program (NoiseScan) for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The exposure data are based on the evaluation of the noise immission level, which includes duration, frequency content, and the use of, and the attenuation performance of, hearing protectors. The input data can handle an unlimited number of exposure periods. If the noise exposure level is not known, the program lists noise levels of comparable work places, and thus provides an estimate of exposure. Confounding medical factors that may contribute to NIHL, such as elevated serum cholesterol level, hypertension, and extensive use of pain killers, are collected. Combined exposure to agents that clearly contribute to NIHL, such as hand-arm vibration, tobacco smoking, use of aminoglycosides and exposure to solvents are also assessed. An unlimited number of audiograms can be stored, and all the data can be completed and edited following collection. The program gives the predicted hearing loss according to the ISO 1999 model based on total exposure. At present, our NoiseScan program (under continuous development in an EU research program) is suitable for the data collection of various risk factors. It can be used to determine whether the hearing loss is occupational in origin and to estimate the efficiency of hearing conservation measures. NoiseScan also predicts the development of hearing loss in individuals in 5-year periods. The goal is to improve and validate the rules by which single and combined risk factors contribute to HIHL, thus leading to more precise prediction of individual hearing loss, and for the evaluation of success of the hearing conservation programs."
"10628244","A study of the noise hazard to employees in local discotheques.","AIM OF STUDY: There is growing concern that amplified music in discotheques can cause hearing loss. This study attempts to evaluate the noise hazard of employees exposed to amplified music in our discotheques.METHOD: Employees comprising of disc jockeys, bartenders, waiters, cashiers and security officers of five selected discotheques were used for the study. Personal noise dosimetry was carried out on 40 employees throughout their workshift. The audiometric examination results of another 46 employees were compared with 37 subjects from a non-exposed match control group.RESULTS: The range of exposure to noise level above 85 dBA for the employees is 3.6 to 6.9 hours with a mean of 5.1 hours. All the occupational groups are exposed to noise level of at least 89 dBA Leq for their whole work shift. The discotheque group has statistically significant higher prevalence (41.9%) of early sensorineural hearing loss compared to the control group (13.5%). A higher proportion of employees in the older age group (above 30 years old) and working longer (above 1 year) suffer from hearing loss. A significant proportion of the discotheque study subjects (21%) also complained of recurrent tinnitus compared to 2.7% in the control group. The younger (&lt; 30 years) and those with shorter exposure duration (&lt; 1 year) appeared to complain of tinnitus more.CONCLUSION: The study shows that all the employees regardless of occupations are exposed to noise above the permissible level of 85 dBA Leq A high proportion of them also suffer from early sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus."
"11707350","Role of free oxygen radicals in noise-related hearing impairment.","This study was aimed at defining the relationship between noise-related hearing impairment in industrial workers exposed to continuous noise. For this malondialdehyde and glutathione peroxidase were analyzed as free radical form and antioxidant form. A total of 60 patients working in the units of a hydroelectric power plant were included in the study. This experimental group was further divided into three subgroups of 20 workers, each group exposed to a different noise level. The control group consisted of 20 male volunteers employed in the Medical Centre where the study was carried out. A standard ascending/descending method was applied to the subjects of the experimental and the control groups in order to determine their hearing thresholds at seven different frequencies between 250 and 8000 Hz. Then, 10 ml blood was collected from each person to measure the malondialdehyde values in plasma and glutathione peroxidase activity in erythrocytes. Slight sensorineural hearing impairment was found in group I beginning at 4 kHz and in group II beginning at 6 kHz. Statistically significant differences were observed in group I and II when compared to the control group (P&lt;0.05). It was found that malondialdehyde levels increased in the experimental groups more than in the control groups. However, this increase was only significant in group I (P&lt;0.05). Erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase activity significantly increased in group I and II compared to the other groups (P&lt;0.05), also, the difference was significant between group I and II (P&lt;0.05). Accordingly, it is suggested that free oxygen radicals may take a role in noise-related hearing impairment."
"11683452","Hearing development in classical orchestral musicians. A follow-up study.","Using pure tone audiometry in 1995, a hearing reassessment was made in 56 classical musicians who participated in Axelsson &amp; Lindgren's study 16 years earlier, in 1979. This study focuses on hearing development in these classical orchestra musicians, active in Göteborg, Sweden. The aim of the study is to evaluate the risk of progressive hearing loss during work in a classical orchestra. Another aim is to study possible hearing differences in females and males and to compare the high frequency pure-tone average values found in the study with two normal materials. The main findings were that the male, compared to the female musicians, showed a tendency toward a more pronounced, although not significant, hearing reduction in the high frequency region and higher threshold distribution within the 90th percentile than the females. This was found most often in the left ear. The median audiogram for all females showed a notch configuration at 6 kHz, compared to the males who had a high-tone sloping configuration. When comparing high frequency pure-tone average (HFPTA) values with ISO 7029, the females are distributed around the ISO 7029 median and well within the 90th percentile. The average among the males was equal with the median. Comparison with Davis normal population &quot;all the sample, overall occupational group&quot; showed a more even distribution of the HFPTA values around the median for both females and males on both occasions. This follow-up study showed no extended negative progress of the pure-tone hearing threshold values in spite of an additional 16 years of musical noise exposure."

"11464397","Firefighters' hearing: a comparison with population databases from the International Standards Organization.","We investigated firefighters' hearing relative to general population data to adjust for age-expected hearing loss. For five groups of male firefighters with increasing mean ages, we compared their hearing thresholds at the 50th and 90th percentiles with normative and age- and sex-matched hearing data from the International Standards Organization (databases A and B). At the 50th percentile, from a mean age of 28 to a mean age of 53 years, relative to databases A and B, the firefighters lost an excess of 19 to 23 dB, 20 to 23 dB, and 16 to 19 dB at 3000, 4000, and 6000 Hz, respectively. At the 90th percentile, from a mean age of 28 to a mean age of 53 years, relative to databases A and B, the firefighters lost an excess of 12 to 20 dB, 38 to 44 dB, 41 to 45 dB, and 22 to 28 dB at 2000, 3000, 4000, and 6000 Hz, respectively. The results are consistent with accelerated hearing loss in excess of age-expected loss among the firefighters, especially at or above the 90th percentile."
"11463869","High-frequency (10-18 kHz) hearing thresholds: reliability, and effects of age and occupational noise exposure.","The objective was to investigate the reliability and effects of age and noise on high-frequency hearing thresholds. A cross-sectional study was used involving 187 exposed and 52 non-industrial noise-exposed subjects selected randomly from noise-exposed and non-industrial noise-exposed subjects, respectively. Each subject was tested with both conventional-frequency (0.25-8 kHz) and high-frequency (10-18 kHz) audiometry. Test-retest results showed that high-frequency audiometry (HFA) was as reliable as the conventional procedure. Although the inter-subject variation was large, the intra-subject variation was small, indicating that HFA can be used more reliably than the conventional procedure to monitor individual cases over time. Both the hearing threshold at high frequencies and the upper frequency limit deteriorated as a function of age and frequency. The exposed subjects had significantly higher hearing thresholds than the non-exposed subjects at all the high frequencies tested, the difference between the two groups being greatest at 14 kHz. Multivariate analysis indicated that age was the primary predictor and noise exposure the secondary predictor of hearing thresholds in a high frequency range (10-18 kHz). In contrast, multivariate analysis indicated the reverse order-noise exposure as the primary predictor, then age-for a conventional frequency range (0.25-8 kHz). The results of this study suggest that HFA might be used as an early indicator for noise-induced hearing loss and acoustic trauma rather than audiometry at a conventional frequency (4 kHz), particularly for younger groups."
"11431958","Effects of stimulus intensity on sound localization in the horizontal and upper-hemispheric median plane.","Sound lateralization ability with headphones is known to be affected by stimulus intensity. However, there have been few studies on sound localization with loudspeakers in free field from the standpoint of stimulus intensity. The aim of this study is to obtain basic data for the tests with normal hearing and hearing-impaired subjects, and for the fitting of a hearing aid. The author investigated the relationship between stimulus intensities and sound localization ability of the broadband noise and pure tone bursts delivered in the horizontal and upper-hemispheric median planes. Subjects were ten volunteers, 5 males and 5 females, at the age of 18-19 years, with normal hearing. The results showed well how subjects perceived directions at all stimulus intensities. The percentage of correct response (%correct) for broadband noise stimuli was maximum at the intensity from 40 to 70 dB SPL (sound pressure level), and was minimum at 0 to 20 dB SPL in both the horizontal plane and the upper-hemispheric median plane. At lower stimulus intensity, examinee could not judge the direction, even if they could hear the stimuli. For pure tone bursts stimuli in the upper-hemispheric median plane, %correct was low irrespective of stimulus intensity."
"11409787","Characteristics of the audiometric notch as a clinical sign of noise exposure.","This study investigated variability in audiometric notch recognition by asking three clinicians to identify notches in the audiograms of 634 noise-exposed employees. Agreement between the raters was assessed, and three notch characteristics, frequency, depth and shape (a wide or narrow notch), were investigated as recognition factors. The proportions of positive tests reported by each rater were 0.26, 0.49 and 0.68, respectively. The 'all rater' index of agreement was 0.45, and the range for pairwise comparisons was 0.14 to 0.52. With recognition factors, rater 1 was most strongly influenced by depth, rater 2 by shape and rater 3 by a possible combination of criteria. To reduce variability we suggest that narrow notches should be at least 15 dB in depth, and that broad notches should have a depth of 20 dB, with a recovery of at least 10 dB at the high end. Care should also be taken to elicit a sufficient history of noise exposure, and ensure that there are no other explanations for the notch."
"11398819","Noise-induced hearing loss among U.S. Air Force cryptolinguists.","BACKGROUND: Occupational noise-induced hearing loss remains epidemic in the U.S. Air Force (USAF) and aircrew members continue to be affected. This study examines noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) observed among USAF cryptolinguists that is attributable to radio noise and attempts to determine whether the current USAF Hearing Conservation Program (HCP) adequately identifies NIHL.METHODS: Audiograms from 120 ground-based cryptolinguists were examined. Comparisons were made between 1998 audiograms and either the reference audiogram or the enlistment audiogram. To determine HCP effectiveness, results were compared with the USAF standard of 3% or fewer permanent threshold shifts (PTS) per year.RESULTS: Some 13.3% of the cryptolinguists experienced standard threshold shifts (STS) between their enlistment audiogram and their initial occupational (reference) audiogram; 9.2% experienced STS in 1998 as compared with their initial enlistment audiogram but only 6 of the 11 (54%) were detectable using the reference audiogram as the baseline. The frequency pattern of changes in hearing thresholds was characteristic for NIHL.CONCLUSIONS: The NIHL that occurs among cryptolinguists prior to performance of the reference audiogram, and the hearing threshold shifts that occur between the enlistment audiogram and the reference audiogram, may obscure future hearing loss in the population. The incidence of PTS appeared to exceed 3% when the enlistment audiogram was used. While this result was not significantly different from 3%, sample size limitations and data accuracy concerns warrant that this population be closely watched in the future."
"11373184","Integrated estimation of the effect of physical factors on human functional state during mental work.","The purpose of this study was to develop a model for an integrated estimation of the functional state of the human organism (FSHO) and an integral estimation of physical factors (PF) for hygienic rating. Tests were performed twice with 3 men in 0.7-clo clothing during 4-hr mental work with 9 combinations of 4 PF: wideband noise (55- 83 dB(A)), whole-body vibration (6 Hz, a(z) = 0.2-1.8 ms(-2)), air temperature (18-30 degrees C), and illumination (1, 3, 5 lx). Thermoregulatory, cardiovascular, and psychophysiological reactions and temporary threshold of hearing (TTS2) shifts were studied. For the integral estimation of PF influence on FSHO the model F(y1,y2..........ym) = f(x1,x2,.......xn) was used, relating both FSHO and PF sets. The most important physiological parameters in creating FSHO are defined and the contribution of individual parameters of FSHO and PF is found."
"11360697","A randomised controlled trial of screening for adult hearing loss during preventive health checks.","BACKGROUND: Prophylactic strategies to counter acquired hearing impairment may involve routine audiometric screening of asymptomatic working-age adults attending general practice for regular health checks.AIM: To evaluate the effect of adult hearing screening on subsequent noise exposure and hearing.DESIGN OF STUDY: A randomised controlled population-based study of health checks and health discussions in general practice.SETTING: The project was initiated in the district of Ebeltoft, Aarhus county, Denmark.METHOD: Intervention group participants' hearing thresholds were determined audiometrically at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 kHz in each ear. Participants were advised to get their ears checked if the average hearing loss exceeded 20 dB hearing level (dBHL) in either ear. Noise avoidance was emphasised when thresholds exceeded 25 dBHL bilaterally at 4 kHz. Follow-up included questionnaires and audiometry.RESULTS: Hearing loss was observed among 18.9% of the study sample at baseline. At the five-year follow-up we recorded no significant differences between the control and the intervention groups regarding subjective or objective hearing, or exposure to occupational noise. However, there was a tendency towards reduction in exposure to leisure noise among intervention participants (P = 0.045). Approximately 20% reported hearing problems; 16.5% reported tinnitus-related complaints; 0.8% used hearing aids; 35.0% reported frequent noise exposure; and occluding wax was suspected in 2.1%.CONCLUSION: Preventive health checks with audiometry did not significantly affect hearing, but leisure noise exposure tended to become less frequent. The poor effect may be ascribed to inadequate audiological counselling or a higher priority to other advice, e.g. on cardiovascular risk or lifestyle."

"11318022","Double hearing protection and speech intelligibility-room for improvement.","INTRODUCTION: Double hearing protection is used in many air forces around the world for protection in noisy aircraft environments, particularly in helicopters. The usual combination is foam ear plugs under headset or helmet muffs. Much of the research that spurred the introduction of foam earplugs indicated little change in speech intelligibility in persons with normal hearing. However, aircrew often complain about having to maximize intercom volume for speech understanding, causing a situation with no reserve volume and bad sound quality. In recent years, further developments have included so-called hi-fi plugs and custom made ear plugs which are claimed to improve speech communication. The aim of the present project was to investigate different types of ear plugs and their effect on speech intelligibility in helicopter noise.METHODS: Each of nine normal-hearing pilot subjects were placed in an environment of recorded helicopter noise from a BO-105 helicopter. Speech audiometry was performed under four different conditions: headset only, and three different ear plugs worn under the headset. Fitting of the ear plugs was performed by an ear, nose and throat specialist to ensure similar conditions. The sequence of test conditions was randomized and double-blind. In addition, a subjective rating scale was used.RESULTS: Wearing foam ear plugs under the headset decreased speech intelligibility dramatically. The &quot;hi-fi&quot; plug was somewhat better than foam plugs, and the custom made ear plug provided a speech intelligibility close to the headset-only situation. Subjective rating scores coincided with these findings.DISCUSSION: In helicopter noise, custom made ear plugs may provide a much improved speech intelligibility over conventional plugs when worn under a headset, while maintaining improved noise protection over the headset-alone situation. Custom made ear plugs might therefore be a good alternative to other forms of enhanced noise protection in helicopters."
"11268809","[Audiometric surveillance of occupational environment].","Noise levels in Danish workplaces at which hearing impairment will occur in more than 10% of the workers are still frequent. Annually 300 cases are compensated for noise induced hearing loss at a national level. This may indicate that the current national hearing protection strategy, which relies on noise reduction only, is insufficient. By audiometric screening early hearing loss will be detected and further progression may be halted. This paper reviews the methods of continuous audiometric screening of noise exposed worker populations. Reliability and validity are discussed, and an overview of quality assurance programmes is given. It is concluded that a national hearing conservation program should be implemented in Denmark."
"11257914","Noise-induced hearing loss among textile workers in Lagos metropolis.","A cross-sectional sample of 204 textile workers was selected randomly from all sections (including the non-production areas), and was initially screened to exclude subjects with pathological middle ear as well as those currently working in sections classified as non-noise but who had been exposed to excessive noise in the past. A total of 17 workers were thus excluded leaving 187 who were then assessed by means of air-conduction and bone-conduction audiograms obtained by the use of a manual (medicor-SA 3L), pure-tone audiometer. All audiometric tests were preceded by an otological examination to rule out the presence of any significant aural pathological conditions. The subjects were divided into 3 groups, based on the noise levels observed at their worksites using a Bruel and Kjaer type 2225 (integrating) sound level meter viz: the noise-exposed group (noise levels &gt; 90 dBA); the less-noise-exposed group (noise levels 85-90 dBA); and the non-noise-exposed group (noise levels &lt; 85 dBA). A comparative analysis of the data on hearing threshold levels of the 3 groups showed that the noise-exposed group had significantly (P &lt; 0.05) elevated hearing threshold levels at all frequencies and in each age group, although the maximal threshold shifts were observed at the 4000 Hz frequency. Also, the hearing threshold levels for the noise-exposed group increased with the duration of noise exposure. The study clearly showed the deleterious effects of uncontrolled occupational noise exposure on unprotected workers. A very high prevalence rate of noise-induced hearing loss (79.8%) was recorded for the noise-exposed group. The less-noise-exposed group recorded a comparatively low figure of 11.3%. The weaving section alone recorded the highest prevalence rate of 84.5%, followed very closely by the spinning section with 71.0%. The lowest prevalence rate (2.9%) was recorded for the administrative staff."

"11209517","The effect of recreational gunfire noise on hearing in workers exposed to occupational noise.","Hearing sensitivity for an experimental group of 278 industrial workers who engaged in recreational shooting was compared with that of an age-matched control group of 278 nonshooting industrial workers to examine the effect of gunfire exposure on auditory thresholds. The influence of age and the number of unprotected gunshot exposures per year also was examined. The subjects in the experimental group completed a questionnaire to define the types of firearms used, the number of years shooting, and the number of protected and unprotected gunshot exposures per year. Results revealed that hearing sensitivity for frequencies 3.0, 4.0, and 6.0 kHz for both ears in the experimental group was an average of approximately 5 to 10 dB poorer than that of the control subjects. Although both subject groups demonstrated poorer 3.0-to-6.0-kHz hearing sensitivity for left-ear compared with right-ear listening, the degree of asymmetry between ears was greater for the experimental subjects. Older shooters had more hearing loss and greater threshold asymmetry than younger shooters, but there was no significant relationship between hearing sensitivity and the number of unprotected exposures per year. This latter finding was attributed to a fourfold increase in the number of unprotected annual exposures that were reported by younger shooters, who had inherently better hearing than did the older shooters."
"12486782","Changes over time in audiometric thresholds in a group of automobile stamping and assembly workers with a hearing conservation program.","Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) is among the 10 leading occupational diseases, afflicting between 7.4 and 10.2 million people who work in noise above 85 dBA. Although mandatory hearing conservation programs (HCPs) have been in effect since 1972, this problem persists, as hearing protectors are not consistently used by workers, or may not attenuate to manufacturer's estimates in real world conditions. In this study, information from noise and hearing protection use measurements taken at an automobile assembly plant were used to construct average lifetime noise exposure and hearing protection compliance estimates for use in modeling to predict both total hearing loss and onset of two accepted definitions of hearing loss. There were 301 males and females in this cohort; their mean age was 42.6 (7.2) years, and mean tenure was 14.3 (3.5) years. Average length of follow-up was 14.0 years. There were 16 members of this cohort who had hearing loss at the speech frequencies (defined as an average hearing level &gt; or = 25 dB at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz). In cross-sectional multivariate analyses, years of employment, male gender, and proportion of time wearing hearing protection were the factors most associated with hearing loss at the average of 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz (p &lt; 0.0001) controlling for age, transfer status (as a surrogate for previous noise exposure), race, and lifetime average noise exposure. The most consistent predictor of hearing loss in both univariate and multivariate analyses was percentage of time having used hearing protection during the workers' tenure."
"12474408","[Hearing disorders among private farmers in Poland].","The studies of the state of hearing were conducted among a selected group of 128 farmers, aged 28-65 years with employment ranging from 11 to 40 years. The study design covered physical laryngologic examinations, detailed otologic medical history and proper audiometric tests (air and bone conduction). The results of the study showed that the highest mean values of hearing loss remained mostly within two high frequencies of 4 and 6 kHz and were 34.9-39.7 d B. These frequencies are typical of acoustic trauma. A highly statistically significant correlation (p &lt; 0.001) was observed between hearing loss and age (r = 0.32-0.53 for 3-8 kHz), while a slightly weaker correlation was noted between hearing loss and employment duration (r = 0.20-0.27 for 3-8 kHz; p &lt; 0.01). The mean values of hearing loss obtained among farmers were considerably enhanced, compared to the control group (42 people aged 29-59 years), the difference being very high statistically (p &lt; 0.001). The studies of the state of private farmers' hearing clearly confirm the hypothesis that an excessive exposure to noise present in the farming equipment, is the major cause of the decreased hearing among farmers."

"12227672","Audiometric findings in workers exposed to low levels of styrene and noise.","Audiometry and exposure measurements were conducted on workers from fiberglass and metal products manufacturing plants and a mail distribution terminal (N = 313). Workers exposed to noise and styrene had significantly worse pure-tone thresholds at 2, 3, 4, and 6 kHz when compared with noise-exposed or nonexposed workers. Age, noise exposure, and urinary mandelic acid (a biologic marker for styrene) were the variables that met the significance level criterion in the multiple logistic regression. The odds ratios for hearing loss were 1.19 for each increment of 1 year of age (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.28), 1.18 for every decibel &gt;85 dB(A) of noise exposure (95% CI, 1.01-1.34), and 2.44 for each millimole of mandelic acid per gram of creatinine in urine (95% CI, 1.01-5.89). Our findings suggest that exposure to styrene even below recommended values had a toxic effect on the auditory system."
"12186037","Distribution of risk factors for hearing loss: implications for evaluating risk of occupational noise-induced hearing loss.","This paper presents an analysis of hearing threshold levels among 2066 white male workers employed in various U.S. industries studied in the 1968-72 NIOSH Occupational Noise and Hearing Survey (ONHS). The distribution of hearing threshold levels (HTL) is examined in relation to various risk factors (age, prior occupational noise, medical conditions) for hearing loss among a population of noise exposed and control (low noise-exposed) industrial workers. Previous analyses of a subset of these data from the ONHS focused on 1172 highly &quot;screened&quot; workers. An additional 894 male workers (609 noise-exposed and 285 controls), who were excluded for various reasons (i.e., nonoccupational noise exposure, otologic or medical conditions affecting hearing, prior occupational noise exposure) have been added to examine hearing loss in an unscreened population. Data are analyzed by age, duration of exposure, and sound level (8-h TWA) by individual test frequency. Results indicate that hearing threshold levels are higher among unscreened noise-exposed and control workers relative to screened workers. Analysis of risk factors such as nonoccupational noise exposure, medical conditions, and type of industry among unscreened controls indicated that these factors were not significantly associated with increased mean HTLs or risk of material impairment over and above what is expected due to age. Age-specific mean hearing threshold levels (and percentiles of the distribution) among the unscreened ONHS control population may be used as a comparison population of low-noise exposed white male industrial workers for evaluating the effectiveness of hearing conservation programs for workers less than 55 years of age. To make valid inferences regarding occupational noise-induced hearing loss, it is important to use hearing data from reference (control) populations that are similar with respect to the degree of subject screening, type of work force (blue vs white collar), and the distribution of other risk factors for hearing loss."
"12176760","Noise exposure and hearing loss among student employees working in university entertainment venues.","OBJECTIVES: Most studies to date on sound levels in entertainment establishments have concentrated on exposure levels for the attending public, rather than employees who may be at greater risk of hearing loss. Of particular concern are young employees. The aim of this pilot study was to (i) estimate typical sound levels in different areas where amplified music was played, (ii) measure temporary threshold shift (TTS) and (iii) estimate the dependence of hearing threshold shifts on measured noise levels.METHODS: This study focused on students working part-time (up to 16 h/week) in music bars and discotheques in a university entertainment venue. All 28 staff were invited to participate in the study. Pre- and post-exposure audiometry was used to determine hearing threshold at both high and low frequencies. Personal dosemeters and static measurements were made to assess noise levels and frequency characteristics. A questionnaire was used to determine patterns of noise exposure and attitudes to noise levels and hearing loss.RESULTS: Of the 28 student employees working in the three areas, 14 (50%) agreed to take part in the study, giving 21 pre- and post-shift audiograms. The mean personal exposure levels for security staff were higher than those of bar staff, with both groups exceeding 90 dB(A). The maximum peak pressure reading for security staff was 124 dB. Although TTS values were moderate, they were found to be highly significant at both low and high frequencies and for both ears. Twenty-nine per cent of subjects showed permanent hearing loss of more than 30 dB at either low or high frequencies. The correlation between TTS and personal exposure was higher at 4 kHz than the low and high frequencies.CONCLUSIONS: Contemporary music may be an important yet little considered contributor to total personal noise exposure, especially amongst young employees. Employees need to be better informed of risks of hearing loss and the need to report changes in hearing acuity. Suggestions are made on strategies for improving the assessment of noise exposure in entertainment venues."

A questionnaire was completed by a total of 119 workers in three garment manufacturing plants. Interviews were conducted with the occupational health nurse or safety director in each plant to determine the policy regarding hearing protection also.RESULTS: Factors that directly influenced the use of hearing protection devices were a clinical definition of health, benefits of and barriers to use of hearing protection devices, self-efficacy in the use of hearing protection devices and perceived health status (R2 =.25, p &lt;.01). An exploratory analysis allowing a direct relationship of modifying factors with the dependent variable explained additional variance in use of hearing protection devices through the contribution of situational factors (R2 =.55, p &lt;.01).CONCLUSIONS: Important factors related to Mexican American workers' use of hearing protection devices were identified to provide direction for nursing interventions. Future research should further test the explanatory capabilities of the Health Promotion Model, explore the importance of situational influences on health behavior, and ensure reliable measures of all model components for this population."
"11915232","Noise attenuation characteristics of a foam type earplug measured using a dummy head.","The attenuation characteristics of the earplug using a dummy head (KEMAR; Knowles Electronics Manikin for Acoustic Research) were measured, when it was exposed to pure tones or broadband noises at three different sound pressure levels (SPLs) of 70, 80 and 90 dB SPL in the 'wide frequency range from 250 to 20 k Hz. We ascertained the satisfactory capacity of noise attenuation except for from 10 k to 14 k Hz. The noise attenuation level increased with frequency until 2 k Hz, became almost constant until 8 k Hz, then decreased at around 10 k to 14 k Hz, and recovered in the range from 16 k to 20 k Hz. The frequency characteristics were identical among three different sound pressure levels and almost identical between pure tones and broadband noises. The change of frequency characteristics affected by the depth of the earplug that was inserted into the artificial ear canal of the KEMAR was also investigated. Measured sound pressure level by the builetin microphone in the KEMAR revealed a region in which the measured sound pressure levels were relatively higher around 10 k Hz. The frequency of the region moved higher when the earplug was inserted more deeply. Therefore it was considered that this phenomenon was related to the resonance frequency of the cylinder-like cavity made between the end section of the earplug and the diaphragm of the built-in microphone."
"11893445","Effect of background noise on perception of English speech for Japanese listeners.","OBJECTIVES: To avoid the accidents induced by confusions of non-native speech perception in the presence of noise at work, this study examined the effect of background noise on the discrimination of English speech for Japanese listeners.METHODS: Normal hearing Japanese subjects, who have English learning experience to the level of college graduates, were tested with the CID W-22 word list in quiet settings and in the presence of white, low-frequency weighted (pink noise), or aircraft noise.RESULTS: The discrimination scores were reduced as S/N ratio decreased, and more adversely affected by background white noise than pink or aircraft noise. The individual variability of English word discrimination scores for Japanese listeners was much larger as the S/N ratio decreased. The typical confusions among phoneme were /m/, /n/, and /s/.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggested that ineffective use of speech cues and difference in composition of English phonemes from Japanese could be responsible for degraded speech discrimination of non-native speech in noise. Moreover, it was expected that Japanese workers with age related hearing loss at higher frequencies might have great difficulty in perceiving English speech sounds in the presence of noise."
"11873535","U.S. Navy and Marine Corps Hearing Conservation Program, 1995-1999: mean hearing thresholds for enlisted personnel by gender and age groups.","This study presents mean hearing thresholds from a cross-sectional study of 68,632 monitoring audiograms submitted to the Navy Environmental Health Center for 1995 to 1999. Records included U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps enlisted personnel (Navy men = 51,643; Navy women = 4,184; Marine Corps men = 12,251: Marine Corps women = 554). Mean hearing thresholds were calculated for age groups (17-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, and 50 years and older), gender (male/female), and service (Navy/Marine Corps). Although hearing thresholds worsened with increasing age, as expected, Navy and Marine Corps men have worse levels than Occupational Safety and Health Administration age-corrected values throughout most of their careers, whereas women were closer to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration values. Hearing thresholds in the Navy have not improved appreciably from historical reports. Threshold variability, as revealed by standard deviations, increased with age and paralleled threshold levels. This epidemiological information suggests that hearing conservation continues to be an important force health protection issue."
"11845992","Age and noise-induced hearing loss.","The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of noise, age and confounders in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Information about work exposure, the use of hearing protective devices, audiogram, environmental and biological factors was collected from 406 paper mill workers exposed to noise levels of 91-94 dB(A), 124 forest workers exposed to noise levels of 96-99 dB(A) and 176 shipyard workers exposed to noise levels 95-97 dB(A). In addition to noise exposure, we collected the following confounders: smoking habits, serum cholesterol, systolic or diastolic blood pressure and use of analgesics. Subjects were classified based on median values, into high- and low-risk groups. The confounders were a significant source of hearing loss (HL) in younger and elderly groups of subjects, serum cholesterol level being the most important. In risk analysis the confounders partly masked the effects of noise in the development of HL. For subjects with less than two confounders, occupational noise exposure determined the development of NIHL. As the number of confounders increased, the noise exposure was overruled by these factors in the development of HL. In analysis where the subjects were matched with pairs by age, exposure, blood pressure and serum cholesterol level, the elderly subjects were more susceptible to NIHL than younger subjects. Factors independently but causally related to age were important in the development of NIHL among workers exposed to noise levels below 98 dB(A)."

Venous blood samples collected from 30 adults (15 men and 15 women) indicated a mean blood Pb level of 45.1 micrograms/dL (SD, 19.5; range, 11.2 to 80.0 micrograms/dL) and in excess of the World Health Organization health-based biological limits (men, 46.2 micrograms/dL; SD, 19.6; range, 18.3 to 80.0 micrograms/dL; women, 44.0 micrograms/dL; SD, 20.1; range, 11.2 to 74.2 micrograms/dL). Mean auditory thresholds at frequencies susceptible to ototoxicity (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, and 8.0 kHz) revealed sensory-neural hearing loss in men, which may be attributable to occupational noise exposure in combination with Pb intoxication. Bilateral brainstem auditory evoked response tests on participants with elevated blood Pb levels (mean, 47.0 micrograms/dL) showed delayed wave latencies consistent with sensory-neural hearing impairment. The results suggest that environmental noise exposure must be considered an important factor in determining sensory-neural hearing status in occupationally Pb-exposed adults."
"11793272","[Progressive noise induced hearing loss caused by hearing AIDS, a dilemma for the worker and the expert alike].","BACKGROUND: Investigating cases of noise induced hearing loss the expert is often confronted with the situation that the hearing loss is progressive although the noise exposure has been reduced to almost non-damaging levels. Other causes such as age, hereditary deafness, head injuries, blasts, internal diseases can be excluded. Hearing aids as sources of damaging noise? By consulting the protocol of the hearing-aid acoustician and by own examinations the expert should obtain the following data: loudness level that yields best discrimination score of speech; level of discomfort for tones and speech, discrimination score that is achieved under free field condition with a speech level of 65 dB, using the hearing aids. Furthermore he should explore the circumstances under which the hearing aids are used: how many hours per day, at what occasions etc.?INTERPRETATION: It is likely that in using the hearing aids they are adjusted to emit an intensity level identical to the one yielding the optimal discrimination score. If this e. g. is 100 dB and the hearing aids are used for 2 hours per day this would be equivalent to an exposure to industrial noise of 94 dB (A) for 8 hours daily without ear protection.DISCUSSION: Among all individuals working under industrial noise exposure today only about 1 - 2 % having unusually vulnerable inner ears will suffer a noise induced hearing loss. On the other hand workers in industrial noise are accustomed to loud noise levels, usually have a raised threshold of discomfort and therefore are likely to adjust their hearing aids to such high intensities. The expert will have to decide whether in an individual case the industrial noise exposure or the use of the hearing aids is the dominant risk for further damage. The consequences in respect to the regulations of the workers' health insurance are discussed."

"14689614","Cortical evoked response audiometry thresholds and neuroleptic, sedative, hypnotic drugs.","Cortical evoked response audiometry is adequate for approximating hearing threshold levels with frequency specificity when the psychoacoustic responses lack reliability and reproducibility (compensation claim). It is well-known that control of wakefulness is essential for the reliability of slow vertex responses (SVR). Therefore, sedative, hypnotic, and neuroleptic drugs are supposed to have possible adverse effects on the detection of SVR. In contrast, brainstem evoked responses (BER) have proved not to be significantly affected by therapeutic doses of these compounds. The purpose of our study was to assess the reliability of SVR-threshold definition in subjects taking neuroleptic, sedative, and hypnotic drugs. Fifteen subjects examined for occupational hearing loss at the Fund for Occupational Diseases in Brussels and regularly taking one or several of these drugs were compared with 27 comparable controls. In each subject the auditory thresholds were defined with both techniques: SVR (1, 2, and 3 kHz) and BER (clicks). A highly significant difference is observed between the two groups: In the group receiving drugs, the SVR threshold for 3 kHz is 12.1 dB (average) higher than the BER threshold, whereas in the group without drugs, the SVR threshold for 3 kHz is 7.77 dB (average) lower than the BER threshold. In the drug group, large interindividual differences are observed. It may be concluded that the use of neuroleptics, sedatives, and hypnotics renders the auditory threshold definition with SVR completely unreliable. In using SVR for medicolegal threshold definition, controlling the 3-kHz threshold with BER always is necessary."

We studied a cross-sectional random sample of farms on which agricultural workers completed an audiometric test and questionnaire, and performed noise dosimetry on a subsample. Sixty-five percent of farms and a total of 586 workers participated. Noise on the subsample of 60 farms lay in a range between 84.8 to 86.8 dB(A) and hearing losses were consistent with this level of exposure. Age, driving tractors without cabs, and working with metal were important risk factors. Reported compliance with hearing protection was higher than that actually observed. The majority of farmers have a moderate risk of hearing loss, but a significant minority is at high risk. Elimination and isolation of noise sources are the control methods of choice, and if residual hearing protection is required, compliance must be improved."
"14665813","Impact of OSHA final rule--recording hearing loss: an analysis of an industrial audiometric dataset.","The 2003 Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Occupational Injury and Illness Recording and Reporting Final Rule changed the definition of recordable work-related hearing loss. We performed a study of the Alcoa Inc. audiometric database to evaluate the impact of this new rule. The 2003 rule increased the rate of potentially recordable hearing loss events from 0.2% to 1.6% per year. A total of 68.6% of potentially recordable cases had American Academy of Audiology/American Medical Association (AAO/AMA) hearing impairment at the time of recordability. On average, recordable loss occurred after onset of impairment, whereas the non-age-corrected 10-dB standard threshold shift (STS) usually preceded impairment. The OSHA Final Rule will significantly increase recordable cases of occupational hearing loss. The new case definition is usually accompanied by AAO/AMA hearing impairment. Other, more sensitive metrics should therefore be used for early detection and prevention of hearing loss."

There were complete data from 50 132 subjects above the age of 19. Effects of various risk factors were estimated using multivariate methods.RESULTS: Noise, ear infections and head injury explained 1-6% of the variance (varying with age, sex and frequency range), apart from what could be explained by age alone (30-58%). The strongest effects were from occupational noise and impulse noise (gun blasts) among middle-aged and older men. Only moderate effects of noise could be detected among women. No effects of amplified music or use of personal stereo players could be demonstrated. There were clear effects of recurrent ear infections and head injury.INTERPRETATIONS: With the possible exception of substantial effects of recurrent ear infections and impulse noise, our results give grounds for somewhat more optimism than most previous results about risk factors for hearing loss."

In this study we investigated hearing loss in 131 men with exposure to noise [80-91 A-weighted decibels; dB(A)] and CS(2) (1.6-20.1 ppm) in a viscose rayon plant. These men were compared with 105 men in the adhesive tape and electronic industries who were exposed to noise only and with 110 men employed in the administrative office of the rayon plant who were exposed to low noise and no CS(2). We conducted interviews to obtain sociodemographic information and exposure assessments, and we performed physical examinations, including hearing tests. Results showed that the prevalence of hearing loss of &gt; 25 dB hearing loss (dBHL) in rayon workers (67.9%) was much higher than that in administrative workers (23.6%) and in the adhesive tape and electronic industrial workers (32.4%). Hearing loss occurred mainly for speech frequencies of 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz. When the CS(2) exposure was measured by the product of CS(2 )exposure level and employment years, the adjusted odds ratios of hearing loss of &gt; 25 dBHL in rayon workers, compared with administrative workers, were 3.8 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.5-9.4] for those with the exposure of 37-214 year-ppm, 14.2 (95% CI, 4.4-45.9) with 215-453 year-ppm exposure, and 70.3 (95% CI, 8.7-569.7) with exposure of &gt; 453 year-ppm.

"14525578","Noise exposure in the orthopaedic operating theatre: a significant health hazard.","BACKGROUND: Surgeons working in orthopedic operating theatres are exposed to significant noise pollution due to the use of powered instruments. This may carry a risk of noise-induced hearing loss. The present study was designed to quantify the noise exposure experienced by surgeons and establish whether this breaches occupational health guidelines for workplace noise exposure.METHODS: A sound dosimeter was worn by the operating surgeon during three total hip replacements and two total knee replacements. A timed record of the procedures was kept concurrently. Noise levels experienced during each part of the procedure and total noise exposures were measured. Noise exposures were compared with occupational health guidelines.RESULTS: Noise exposure in total hip replacement averaged 4.5% (1.52-6.45%) of the allowed daily dose (average duration 77.28 min). Total knee replacement exposure was 5.74% (4.09-7.39%) of allowed daily exposure (average duration: 69.76 min). Maximum sound levels approached but did not exceed recommended limits of 110 dBA (108.3 dBA in total hip replacement and 107.6 dBA in total knee replacement). Transient peak sound levels exceeded maximums of 140 dB on multiple occasions during surgery.CONCLUSIONS: Overall total noise dose during orthopaedic surgery was acceptable but orthopaedic surgeons experience brief periods of noise exposure in excess of legislated guidelines. This constitutes a noise hazard and carries a significant, but unquantified risk for noise-induced hearing loss."

This study describes perceived and measured hearing ability among construction laborers and farmers in order to further the Healthy People 2010 goal to reduce noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).METHODS: Construction laborers (n = 147) and farmers (n = 150) had screening audiograms at their workplace and a farm show, respectively. The relationship of the audiograms with a one-item measure of perceived hearing ability was explored using non-parametric statistics.RESULTS: At the 4,000 Hz frequency, indicative of NIHL, a high percentage of both groups exhibited hearing loss greater than 25 dB: laborers 53%, farmers 67%. Perceived hearing ability was significantly worse (P &lt; 0.05) for workers with a measured hearing loss. The sensitivities of perceived hearing loss compared to audiometry ranged from 0.30 to 0.72 suggesting that perceived hearing loss was not a good indicator of actual hearing loss in this sample.CONCLUSIONS: The poor relationship between perceived and actual hearing loss in this study suggests that best practice requires inclusion of audiometric screening as part of a complete hearing loss prevention program. Future development of an improved instrument to measure perceived hearing ability may be useful in assessing this dimension of hearing."
"14501543","Effectiveness of a tailored intervention to increase factory workers' use of hearing protection.","BACKGROUND: In the United States it is estimated that more than 30 million workers are exposed to harmful levels of noise on the job. When engineering or administrative controls cannot be used to reduce noise, workers should always use hearing protection devices (HPDs) when exposed to loud noise to prevent noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Previous research has shown that workers do not always use HPDs when required; therefore, it is essential that workers assume personal responsibility for preventing NIHL by increasing their use of HPDs.OBJECTIVES: This study tested the effectiveness of an individually tailored multimedia intervention to increase use of HPDs by factory workers.METHODS: A randomized controlled design was used to compare the effects of a tailored intervention (n= 446) with two other interventions (a nontailored predictor-based intervention (n= 447) and a control intervention (n= 432)) on workers' self-reported use of HPDs 6 to 18 months following the intervention.RESULTS: Only those workers receiving the tailored intervention significantly increased their use of HPDs from pretest to posttest. However, this increase significantly differed from the nontailored group but not from the control group.CONCLUSIONS: Individually-tailored interventions offer promise for changing behavior. In light of the similarity between the results for the tailored intervention and the control intervention groups, further research is needed to understand barriers to HPD use and how to maximize the benefits of individually tailored interventions in this setting."

The workers were divided into three groups according to the noise level and into four groups according to the duration of exposure.RESULTS: The mean hearing thresholds of workers showed significant increases in all frequencies from 4000 to 16000 Hz (p&lt;0.005), the most affected frequencies being 4000, 6000, 14000, and 16000 Hz (p&lt;0.0005). Increases in hearing thresholds were significantly correlated with the noise level and duration of exposure to noise (p&lt;0.05).CONCLUSION: The results suggest that high-frequency audiometry should be used together with standard audiometry in the detection and follow-up of individuals who are at potential risks for hearing losses."
"12937188","Agreement between hearing thresholds measured in non-soundproof work environments and a soundproof booth.","AIMS: To study the agreement between audiometric test results measured in non-soundproof environments at the worksite, and in a soundproof booth.METHODS: In a cross sectional prevalence study on noise induced hearing loss, 885 transport workers whose hearing thresholds were measured by a standard audiometric test method in non-soundproof environments at the worksite were identified to have some hearing loss (&gt;25 dB), and were retested in a soundproof booth.RESULTS: At 4-8 KHz, the mean of the absolute differences in hearing threshold obtained by these two methods was 2 dB or less. When the proportions of hearing loss (&gt; or =30 dB for any frequencies at 3-8 KHz, or &gt; or =90 dB for three low frequencies at 0.5-2 KHz, or &gt; or =90 dB for three high frequencies at 3-6 KHz) were compared, considerable differences existed. A much better agreement was obtained when the criteria for hearing loss as measured in the field test under non-soundproof conditions were relaxed by 5 dB. At 4 KHz, the difference between the proportion of subjects with hearing loss as measured in the field and that as measured in the booth was the smallest. The kappa statistic was highest at 3 and 4 KHz.CONCLUSIONS: Audiometric test results conducted in non-soundproof environments in the field are comparable to those obtained in a soundproof environment among transport workers with a hearing loss of &gt;25 dB. The hearing threshold at 4 KHz appears suitable for the estimation of the prevalence of hearing loss when appropriate adjustments are made in the diagnostic criteria."
"12908866","Alternative field methods for measuring hearing protector performance.","In comparison with the mandatory noise reduction rating (NRR) testing of every hearing protector sold in the United States, real-world tests of hearing protector attenuation are scarce. This study evaluated data from three potential field-test methods as compared with the subject-fit data from Method B of ANSI S12.6-1997 for the E.A.R(R) Express trade mark Pod Plug trade mark. The new field-test methods were the FitCheck headphone (FCH) method, FitCheck in sound field (FCSF) method, and bone-conduction loudness balance (BCLB) method, all of which can be administered in small single-person audiometric booths such as are commonly found in industry. Twenty normal-hearing and audiometrically competent subjects naive to hearing protector use were tested with the laboratory and the three field-test methods in a repeated-measures design. Repeated-measures models with structured covariance matrices were used to analyze the data. Significant effects were found for method, frequency, and first-order frequency-by-gender and frequency-by-method interactions. These effects and interactions were expected given the different psychophysical tasks. The FCSF and BCLB methods provided attenuations that were not significantly different from those found with Method B. Although the attenuations measured for the FCH method were statistically different (greater) than the attenuations from the other methods, the differences were within the magnitude of acceptable test-retest audiometric variability. The results suggest that the FCH and FCSF methods were both feasible and reliable methods for field testing. The FCH method is limited to testing earplugs, and the FCSF requires additional equipment to outfit the test booth, but could be used for testing all types of protectors."

"12807257","Monitoring and assessment of daily exposure of roadside workers to traffic noise levels in an Asian city: a case study of Bangkok streets.","Four noise monitoring sites were strategically established to evaluate average noise level and audiometric assessment at various traffic zones of Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR). During the monitoring period, noise levels were found to be 72.8-83.0 dBA during day time and 59.5-74.5 dBA during night time. The finding also indicated that traffic noise levels depend on distance from roadside, diurnal variation and character of the traffic and street configuration. Audiometric measurement of 4000 persons was carried by four major hospitals in Bangkok to study the relationship between traffic noise exposure of groups of people working in the streets and hearing loss. Four different categories of occupational people, i.e., drivers, street vendors, traffic officers and dwellers were selected and were further classified into age groups (16-25, 26-35, 36-45 and 46-55 years old) to monitor the traffic noise induced hearing loss throughout their everyday lives. The control group was deliberately chosen to screen out the effects of traffic noise. According to the audiometric investigation, it was revealed that hearing capacity of the daily noise exposure groups living in the three urban sites (Yaowarat Road, Din Daeng Road and Ratchaprarop Road) were noticeably poorer than those who were living in suburban site (Phahonyothin Road). It was noted that the mean hearing threshold level (HTL) of the 16-25 years old groups were found to have better hearing capacity than those older adults of 46-55 years old. In particular the mean HTL dropped at the frequency of 4000 Hz. Among the occupational population who were living in the urban monitoring sites, the driver groups were found to have the highest risk of traffic noise induced hearing loss."
"12768684","[Application of extended high frequency audiometry in the early diagnosis of noise--induced hearing loss].","OBJECTIVE: To assess the application of 10-20 kHz audiometry in early diagnosis of noise-induced hearing loss and to explore the relationship between hearing loss and subjects' age, the exposure time as well as the noise level.METHODS: One thousand workers with noise exposure history were examined by pure tone audiometry(0.5-20 kHz). One hundred and twenty normal subjects served as the control group.RESULTS: The noise levels at working sites ranged from 95 to 115dB(A). Compared with the control group, noise-exposed subjects showed minor changes in the thresholds from 0.5 to 6 KHz, whereas the thresholds were elevated in the high frequency range of 10-16 kHz (P &lt; 0.001). The incidence of ears without any response to the maximum output at the frequency range of 14 to 20 kHz was much higher (P &lt; 0.01) than that of the control group. In the animals exposed to noise, the thresholds of 10-18 kHz increased with the aging and with increase of working time (6-10 years), but there were no significant differences among subjects exposed to the noises at different levels(P &gt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: In noise-exposed ears, the occurrence of threshold changes in the high frequency range (10 to 20 kHz) is earlier than that in the low frequency range (0.5 to 6 kHz). Aging and working time also affect the 10-20 kHz hearing thresholds. The lack of responses to maximum output and the changes in thresholds in the high frequency range (10-20 kHz) can be used as indices for the diagnosis of early noise-induced hearing loss and for the assessment of the susceptibility of the subject to noise damage."
"12747520","Hearing loss among workers at an oil refinery in Taiwan.","In this study, the authors determined the characteristics of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and its association with hearing-loss-related symptoms (HLRSs) among workers at an oil refinery in Taiwan. Workers from the refinery (N = 384) who had chronic noise exposure (range = 73 to 89 dBa; mean = 81.2, standard deviation = 5.4 dBa) were enrolled in the study. Workers chronically exposed to noise levels that were less than 85 dBa experienced slight hearing loss at high frequencies [(3k + 4k + 6k)/3]. Workers with &gt; or = 1 HLRSs had increased hearing loss at low frequencies [(0.5k + 1k + 2k)/3] and high frequencies (odds ratios = 7.2 and 3.7, respectively). An increased hearing threshold shift for high frequencies (3k, 4k, and 6k Hz) was found in workers who had chronic noise exposure for more than 15 yr. These findings indicate that self-reported HLRSs provide valuable early warning signs of NIHL."
"12723484","[Utility and limitations of speech audiometry testing in the detection of occupational noise-induced hearing loss: a comparative study in two groups in the hospital setting].","OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is the evaluation of the calculation of 100% intelligibility threshold and noise resistance index as a monitoring test in populations exposed to noise in their work environment.METHOD: This is a retrospective exposed-unexposed study as the exposure to the risk factors took place before the survey. The exposed subjects were chosen in principle on sonometric criteria and the unexposed subjects among employees whom we believe were not exposed. The exploration method included history taking, clinical examination, free field audiometry and speech audiometry with background noise.RESULTS: The exposed population has a 100% intelligibility threshold on average equal to 29.69 dB, significantly higher than in the unexposed population where it is calculated at 25.30 dB (p = 0.07). The noise resistance index varies with age (p = 0.04).CONCLUSION: Our study shows the existence of a significant hearing difference between two populations with different noise exposure. It demonstrates a relationship between a hearing loss risk factor such as noise and the occurrence of the &quot;professional hearing loss&quot; disorder. The calculation of the 100% intelligibility index and the noise resistance index advantageously complements tonal audiometry. These procedures provide a better approach to the social impact of hearing loss but were not useful in the detection of hearing loss."

The diagnostic procedure was completed for 52 patients (23 females and 29 males; mean age: 53 years). In this group, five patients were found to have conductive hearing loss due to chronic eustachtis or otosclerosis. They were excluded from further studies. Among the other 47 patients, 26 showed normal hearing threshold and 21 suffered from uni- or bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Hyperacusis was diagnosed in 16 cases. The measurements of brainstem evoked potentials revealed V wave latency asymmetry in 7 cases, which implied the necessity to perform CT or MNR. In neither of cases did this diagnosis confirm the suspected tumor development (n. VIII neurinoma or pontocerebral angle tumor. The preliminary assessment of treatment efficacy for subjective tinnitus with use of retraining therapy yielded the following conclusions: 1. The application of hearing aid brings about an immediate improvement in the patient's self-assessment of hearing and a better tolerance towards tinnitus. 2. A systematic all-day wear of noise generators contributes to the patient's increased tolerance towards tinnitus, improved mental condition and alleviated hyperacusis. 3. The efficacy of the tinnitus retraining therapy, following Jastreboff, depends on providing the patient with detailed information on the causes and mechanisms of tinnitus development. 4. The negative diagnostics for tumor within the cranial cavity has not only a soothing effect on the patient as it relieves his/her stress, but it can also be a good starting point for the tinnitus retraining therapy."
"12631438","The concept of noise sensitivity: implications for noise control.","The term &quot;noise sensitivity&quot; is frequently used in many areas of noise research. However, it can be used to describe several different effects and it can be measured in different ways. In noise surveys, noise sensitivity refers to the fact that individuals differ in the annoyance produced by different sources of noise. Noise sensitivity can be viewed as an independent variable, which may be directly related to outcomes such as health status, or it can be conceptualized as a factor that modifies or mediates the effects of noise exposure on the outcome measure. Noise sensitivity is highly correlated with the general trait negative affectivity, a measure of the extent to which individuals perceive or report negative features of their environment or self. Indeed, few studies have demonstrated effects of noise sensitivity that are independent of negative affectivity. This implies that it is most appropriate to examine general indicators of reported sensitivity rather than a noise-specific measure. Noise sensitivity can also be considered in terms of physiological reactivity to noise sources. Such effects are often only weakly associated with self-reports of noise sensitivity. Habituation to noise is also an important topic to consider and again this appears to be largely independent of self-reported noise sensitivity. Overall, it would appear that it is important to distinguish between subjective reports of noise sensitivity and objective indicators. Different factors will modify these two aspects of noise sensitivity and this implies that different strategies are needed to influence them. Such effects must be taken into consideration when one considers whether control should be targeted at the community in general, or whether it should also cover the most sensitive individuals."
"12597181","Evaluation of the risk of noise-induced hearing loss among unscreened male industrial workers.","Variability in background risk and distribution of various risk factors for hearing loss may explain some of the diversity in excess risk of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). This paper examines the impact of various risk factors on excess risk estimates of NIHL using data from the 1968-1972 NIOSH Occupational Noise and Hearing Survey (ONHS). Previous analyses of a subset of these data focused on 1172 highly &quot;screened&quot; workers. In the current analysis, an additional 894 white males (609 noise-exposed and 285 controls), who were excluded for various reasons (i.e., nonoccupational noise exposure, otologic or medical conditions affecting hearing, prior occupational noise exposure) have been added 2066) to assess excess risk of noise-induced material impairment in an unscreened population. Data are analyzed by age, duration of exposure, and sound level (8-h TWA) for four different definitions of noise-induced hearing impairment, defined as the binaural pure-tone average (PTA) hearing threshold level greater than 25 dB for the following frequencies: (a) 1-4 kHz (PTA1234), (b) 1-3 kHz (PTA123), (c) 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz (PTA512), and (d) 3, 4, and 6 kHz (PTA346). Results indicate that populations with higher background risks of hearing loss may show lower excess risks attributable to noise relative to highly screened populations. Estimates of lifetime excess risk of hearing impairment were found to be significantly different between screened and unscreened population for noise levels greater than 90 dBA. Predicted age-related risk of material hearing impairment in the ONHS unscreened population was similar to that predicted from Annex B and C of ANSI S3.44 for ages less than 60 years. Results underscore the importance of understanding differential risk patterns for hearing loss and the use of appropriate reference (control) populations when evaluating risk of noise-induced hearing impairment among contemporary industrial populations."
"12592917","Effects of occupational ultrasonic noise exposure on hearing of dental hygienists: a pilot study.","PURPOSE: The purpose of this case-control study was to determine whether long-term ultrasonic noise exposure via the dental office environment is related to dental hygienists' hearing status.METHODS: Registered dental hygienists (N = 698) who live in the Hampton Roads areas of Virginia were mailed a Dental Hygiene Work History Questionnaire to determine who would meet the inclusion criteria and would be willing to participate in the study. Consenting subjects were categorized into one of two groups, according to ultrasonic scaler usage rate, and matched on age. Persons with known hearing loss due to infection, disease, or congenital defect were excluded from the study. The final sample consisted of 20 dental hygienists with a high ultrasonic usage rate and a matched group of 20 dental hygienists who had a low ultrasonic usage rate. Once the groups were formed, a certified audiologist tested subjects' hearing in each ear via the pure-tone audiometer. Audiometric data were analyzed using the analysis of variance for repeated measures procedure to determine if degree of ultrasonic scaler noise exposure in the dental office environment was significantly related to hearing status in these dental hygienists.RESULTS: Results revealed that the right and left ears were not statistically different in the hearing threshold levels, regardless of group status. However, there was a significant difference in the high ultrasonic usage group and the low ultrasonic usage group at the 3000 Hz. No differences were found at the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz.CONCLUSIONS: Based on these outcomes, the ultrasonic scaler is not considered to have a negative effect on the hearing of dental hygienists at 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz, but may be related to hearing loss at 3000 Hz. Ultrasonic noise may in fact be affecting dental hygienists' hearing at 3000 Hz, but loss of hearing observed at the higher frequencies may be attributed to other unidentified factors present in both groups."

"12553175","Ototoxic effects of occupational exposure to styrene and co-exposure to styrene and noise.","Ototoxicity of styrene and the synergistic action of styrene and noise have been shown in rats. The respective data in humans are scarce and equivocal. This study evaluated the effects of occupational exposure to styrene and combined exposures to styrene and noise on hearing. The study group, comprised of 290-yacht yard and plastic factory workers, was exposed to a mixture of organic solvents, having styrene as its main compound. The reference group, totaling 223 subjects, included (1) white-collar workers, exposed neither to solvents nor noise and (2) metal factory workers, exposed exclusively to noise. All subjects were assessed by means of a detailed questionnaire and underwent otorhinolaryngological and audiometric examinations. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed almost a 4-fold (or 3.9; 95% CI = 2.4-6.2) increase in the odds of developing hearing loss related to styrene exposure. The factors adjusted for were: age, gender, current occupational exposure to noise, and exposure to noise in the past. In cases of the combined exposures to styrene and noise, the odds ratios were two to three times higher than the respective values for styrene-only and noise-only exposed subjects. The mean hearing thresholds--adjusted for age, gender, and exposure to noise--were significantly higher in the solvent-exposed group than in the unexposed reference group at all frequencies tested. A positive linear relationship existed between an averaged working life exposure to styrene concentration and a hearing threshold at the frequencies of 6 and 8 kHz. This study provides the epidemiological evidence that occupational exposure to styrene is related to an increased risk of hearing loss. Combined exposures to noise and styrene seem to be more ototoxic than exposure to noise alone."

One hundred and seventeen workers were tested in routine pure-tone tested method. The SPVN and ABR were tested within fifty-one workers of all.RESULT: The working noise of Yansan Petrochemical Co. belongs to the broad band and steady noise. The intensity of the working noise were during 85.7-104.0 dB(A) and the main frequency were during 1-8 kHz. About 59 percent workers who exposed to the working noise had hearing loss. The most hearing-loss were in the high frequency. The hearing-loss of speech frequency were slight. Workers who have more six years standing have obviously increased hearing-loss than the workers who have less five years standing. There were significant differences the ABR thresholds and wave-interval between the tested and controlled groups. The SPVN and CP were abnormal in more than 17.4 percent workers with hearing loss.CONCLUSION: The working noise of Yansan Petrochemical Co. belongs to the broad band and steady noise.

The aim of the study was to assess the acoustic environment of persons exposed to jet engine noise and its effect on hearing.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Noise measurements were performed on three jet engines. During the target practice, the following parameters were measured: equivalent noise, pressure level A, maximum sound pressure level A, and peak sound pressure level C. The spectro-analysis covering the range from 0.1 to 20 kHz was conducted. Hearing was assessed in 50 noise-exposed men, aged 24-51 years (mean age, 35.5 years), using PTA, tympanometry and DPOAE. The control group consisted of 40 non-exposed persons with good hearing condition.RESULTS: Maximum levels of acoustic pressure exceeded Polish standards. Comparison between two groups showed that PTA was higher in the exposed persons by 6.3-6.8 dB on average and DPOAE was reduced in the group exposed to jet engine noise more than it could have been expected.CONCLUSIONS: Even during a single test, aircraft technical personnel was exposed to (audible) noise that significantly exceeded admissible values. The reduction in DPOAE values in persons exposed to noise of jet engines was incommensurably higher than changes in PTA."

"15587460","Occupational noise and effects on blood pressure: exploring the relationship of hypertension and noise exposure in workers.","Hearing loss is the second most self reported occupational illness or injury. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, approximately 30 million workers are exposed to hazardous noise on the job. Often only hearing loss is thought of when one refers to occupational noise, but there may be other factors to consider when addressing occupational noise such as blood pressure. What is not clear, however, is whether noise contributes to changes in blood pressure. Occupational noise is a problem in various settings and comes with known and possible health consequences. To identify and prevent possible health related effects, workplace monitoring, audiometry, and blood pressure screenings are essential. When in work settings with elevated noise exposures, occupational and environmental health nurses should be focused on creating a program designed to prevent exposure to high levels of occupational noise."

"15551949","[Noise-related occupational risk aboard fishing vessels: considerations on prevention and the protection of exposed workers].","Recent legislation regarding the safety of workers aboard fishing vessels requires the appointment by ship owners of a Reference Physician in charge of health surveillance, preventive inspections and related tasks. As maritime workers, especially fishermen, have always been excluded from legal protection of occupational health, there are no exhaustive data on the incidence of their occupational disease. Several epidemiological studies of fishermen have evidenced a high prevalence and incidence of occupational conditions, among which noise-related hypoacousia. We report data of a phonometric survey conducted aboard six fishing vessels carrying a crew of less than six fishing in the mid-Adriatic. Measurements were performed during fishing and navigation aboard five vessels fitted with a fixed-pitch propeller and during fishing only aboard one vessel fitted with an controllable pitch propeller. Measurements were conducted: 1) in the engine rooms; 2) in the work area on deck; 3) at the winch; 4) in the wheelhouse; 5) in the mess-room and kitchen; 6) in the sleeping quarters. Results show that the equivalent sound pressure level in the engine rooms consistently exceeded 90 dBA on all vessels. The speed of the vessels fitted with the fixed-pitch propeller is 3-4 knots in the fishing phase and around 10 knots during navigation to and from the fishing grounds; noise emission is lower with the former regimen because of the smaller number of engine revolutions per minute. Our survey demonstrated considerably different noise levels in the various areas of vessels. One key element in workers' exposure, the tasks assigned and the environmental working conditions is of course the type of fishing in which the vessel is engaged. Further phonometric studies are required to assess the daily level of exposure per crew member, which represents the reference for the noise-related risk of each subject. Knowledge of the sound pressure levels in the work environment and the length of daily exposure of each crew member will allow to assess the level of occupational exposure and consequently enact the proper prevention and protection measures by the Reference Physician."
"15497506","Frequency-specific association of antibodies against heat shock proteins 60 and 70 with noise-induced hearing loss in Chinese workers.","Noise exposure may result in production of auto-antibodies against heat shock proteins (Hsps), which might be of significance in the pathogenesis or prognosis (or both) of auto-immune ear diseases. However, it is not known whether these antibodies are associated with noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in workers exposed to noise in occupational settings. Using immunoblotting with human recombinant Hsps, audiological assessment, and multivariate logistic regression models, we investigated the presence of antibodies against Hsp60 and Hsp70 and hearing levels, and analyzed their associations with NIHL in 399 workers exposed to noise between 75 and 115 dB. Our findings showed that the prevalence of positive anti-Hsp70 was significantly higher in the workers with slight and moderate high-frequency hearing loss than in normal workers (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the prevalence of positive anti-Hsp60 in workers with moderate low-frequency NIHL was significantly higher than in the normal (P &lt; 0.01). The levels of anti-Hsp70 and anti-Hsp60 seemed correlated, and the level of anti-Hsp70 better predicted the level of anti-Hsp60. An elevated plasma level of anti-Hsp70 was associated with a nonsignificantly increased risk of high-frequency NIHL (adjusted OR = 1.45; 95% CI = 0.89-2.36) and an elevated plasma level of anti-Hsp60 was associated with a nonsignificantly increased risk of the low-frequency NIHL (adjusted OR = 2.25; 95% CI = 0.85-5.96). These results suggest that the production of anti-Hsp60 and anti-Hsp70 may play a role in the pathogenesis of NIHL, and that anti-Hsps may be a risk factor. The precise mechanisms for the elevation of antibodies against Hsps caused by noise exposure and their possible role in the development of NIHL warrant further investigations."
"15477283","Predictors of hearing threshold levels and distortion product otoacoustic emissions among noise exposed young adults.","AIM: To examine the relations between noise exposure and other risk factors with hearing function as measured by audiometric thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emissions.METHODS: A total of 456 subjects were studied (393 apprentices in construction trades and 63 graduate students). Hearing and peripheral auditory function were quantified using standard, automated threshold audiometry, tympanometry, and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). The analysis addressed relations of noise exposure history and other risk factors with hearing threshold levels (HTLs) and DPOAEs at the baseline test for the cohort.RESULTS: The cohort had a mean age of 27 (7) years. The construction apprentices reported more noise exposure than students in both their occupational and non-occupational exposure histories. A strong effect of age and years of work in construction was observed at 4, 6, and 8 kHz for both HTLs and DPOAEs. Each year of construction work reported prior to baseline was associated with a 0.7 dB increase in HTL or 0.2 dB decrease DPOAE amplitude. Overall, there was a very similar pattern of effects between the HTLs and DPOAEs.CONCLUSIONS: This analysis shows a relatively good correspondence between the associations of noise exposures and other risk factors with DPOAEs and the associations observed with pure-tone audiometric thresholds in a young adult working population. The results provide further evidence that DPOAEs can be used to assess damage to hearing from a variety of exposures including noise. Clarifying advantages of DPOAEs or HTLs in terms of sensitivity to early manifestations of noise insults, or their utility in predicting future loss in hearing will require longitudinal follow up."

"15457814","Occupational hearing loss: screening with distortion-product otoacoustic emissions.","Hearing assessment of applicants for occupational hearing loss compensation can be a time-consuming process. An accurate screening procedure that is sensitive to occupational hearing loss may have application in many situations. The present study developed distortion-product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) screening criteria to identify subjects likely to meet the Hong Kong requirements for occupational hearing loss compensation, namely a bilateral sensorineural loss &gt; or = 40 dB HL (average of 1000, 2000 and 3000 Hz). The screening criteria of 1500 and/or 2000 Hz, with a signal-to-noise ratio of &gt; 0 or 3 dB, yielded high sensitivity and specificity. DPOAE measures therefore have the potential to accurately indicate possible occupational hearing loss. However, DPOAEs should be used as a screening tool only, as conventional puretone audiometry remains the more comprehensive measure of hearing sensitivity."
"15330390","The accuracy of self-reported high noise exposure level and hearing loss in a working population in Eastern Saudi Arabia.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of questions in identifying subjects occupationally exposed to high noise level and those with hearing loss using noise dosimeter and pure-tone air conduction audiometry as the gold standards.DESIGN: A cross-sectional study involving 259 noise-exposed workers selected randomly from two factories in Eastern Saudi Arabia. Personal noise exposure was determined using a noise dosimeter. The hearing impairment for each subject was assessed using otoscopic examination and audiometry. Each subject completed a comprehensive questionnaire including questions about noise exposure and hearing loss.RESULTS: Eighty five percent of the total workers reported exposure to high noise level, compared to 76% found to be exposed to a high noise level defined as more than 85 dB (A) as determined by noise dosimeter. The prevalence of audiometric hearing loss (threshold average of 25 dB HL or more in any ear) was 32.4% for the low frequency average (0.5, 1 and 2 kHz), 47.9% for the all frequency average (0.5, 1, 2. 4 and 8 kHz) and 65.6% for the high frequency average (4 and 8 kHz). However, the percentage of the subjects who reported hearing loss ranged between 3.9% and 85.3% depending on the question used as indicator of hearing loss. The question &quot;Do you consider the noise level where you are working now high?&quot; was the most sensitive in correctly identifying subjects exposed to a noise level of more than 85 dB (A) (sensitivity = 93.4%) and subjects with hearing loss (sensitivity &gt; 86%) compared with other questions evaluated. However, it overestimated the prevalence rate determined by audiometry.CONCLUSION: We conclude that in industries where facilities for an objective assessment of noise exposure and hearing loss are not available, questions addressing noise exposure and hearing loss might be a useful alternative means for screening subjects exposed to high noise level and those with hearing loss for the purpose of designing and implementing hearing conservation program."
"15318633","[A clinical study about occupational noise-induced hearing loss measured and diagnosed with transient evoked otoacoustic emissions].","OBJECTIVE: To study the feasibility and clinical values of occupational noise-induced hearing loss measured, evaluated and diagnosed with transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE).METHOD: Pure tone threshold and TEOAE were performed in 11 (22 ears) young adults with normal hearing of control group and 90 (180 ears) noise exposure workers of test group. According to length of noise exposure time, test group was disparted to test 1,2,3 groups. Stimulated tone of TEOAE is non-linearity click of 80 dB SPL.RESULT: In test group and test 1,2,3 group against control, pure tone threshold in all frequency increased significantly, and correlation, strength and SNR of TEOAE in overall and every frequency declined significantly (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01). To observe test 1,2,3 group, It was found that pure tone threshold in all frequency increased and correlation, strength and SNR of TEOAE in overall and every frequency declined, when length of noise exposure time is increased. In 2.50-3.50 and 3.50-4.50 kHz, measuring values of TEOAE declined most significantly.CONCLUSION: Occupational noise-induced hearing loss can been measured and diagnosed significantly with TEOAE. The best observed contents is correlation, strength and SNR of TEOAE in overall and every part frequency. The best sensitivity observed frequency parts of TEOAE is 2.50-3.50 and 3.50-4.50 kHz."
"15289584","Noise-induced hearing loss and hearing conservation in mining.","BACKGROUND: Noise exposure is prevalent in mining, and as the prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss has not changed much in the past two decades, hearing conservation is an important issue.OBJECTIVES: To review the literature and highlight important developments in the field.METHODS: A review of the literature using OVID as the primary search engine, using the search terms as: noise, occupational; hearing loss, noise induced; ear protective devices; and mining.RESULTS: A total of 66 articles were found, but only 11 were in the English language and few were published in the past 10 years. This is disappointing, because neither noise exposure nor the consequent risk of noise-induced hearing loss seems to have changed much in the past 20 years. Noise is, however, a generic hazard, and this article reviews current best practice in prevention."

"15238306","Noise exposure and hearing loss among sand and gravel miners.","The objectives of this study were to describe workplace noise exposures, risk factors for hearing loss, and hearing levels among sand and gravel miners, and to determine whether full shift noise exposures resulted in changes in hearing thresholds from baseline values. Sand and gravel miners (n = 317) were interviewed regarding medical history, leisure-time and occupational noise exposure, other occupational exposures, and use of hearing protection. Audiometric tests were performed both before the work shift (following a 12-hour noise-free interval) and immediately following the work shift. Full shift noise dosimetry was conducted. Miners' noise exposures exceeded the Recommended Exposure Limit (REL) of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) for 69% of workers, and exceeded the Mine Safety and Health Administration's action level for enrollment in a hearing conservation program for 41% of workers. Significantly higher noise exposures occurred among employees of small companies, among workers with a job classification of truck driver, among males, and among black workers. Hearing protection usage was low, with 48% of subjects reporting that they never used hearing protection. Hearing impairment, as defined by NIOSH, was present among 37% of 275 subjects with valid audiograms. Black male workers and white male workers had higher hearing thresholds than males from a comparison North Carolina population unexposed to industrial noise. Small but statistically significant changes in hearing thresholds occurred following full shift noise exposure among subjects who had good hearing sensitivity at baseline. In a logistic regression model, age and history of a past noisy job were significant predictors of hearing impairment. Overall, sand and gravel workers have excessive noise exposures and significant hearing loss, and demonstrate inadequate use of hearing protection. Well-designed hearing conservation programs, with reduction of noise exposure, are clearly needed."
"15220495","Verbal communication in MR environments: effect of MR system acoustic noise on speech understanding.","PURPOSE: To assess the masking effect of magnetic resonance (MR)-related acoustic noise and the effect of passive hearing protection on speech understanding.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Acoustic recordings were made at 1.5 T at patient and operator (interventionalist in the MR suite) locations for relevant pulse sequences. In an audiologic laboratory, speech-to-noise ratios (STNRs) were determined, defined as the difference between the absolute sound pressure levels of MR noise and speech. The recorded noise of the MR sequences was played simultaneously with the recorded sentences at various intensities, and 15 healthy volunteers (seven women, eight men; median age, 27 years) repeated these sentences as accurately as possible. The STNR that corresponded with a 50% correct repetition was used as the measure for speech intelligibility. In addition, the effect of passive hearing protection on speech intelligibility was tested by using an earplug model.RESULTS: Overall, speech understanding was reduced more at operator than at patient location. Most problematic were fast gradient-recalled-echo train and spiral k-space sequences. As the absolute sound pressure level of these sequences was approximately 100 dB at patient location, the vocal effort needed to attain 50% intelligibility was shouting (&gt;77 dB). At operator location, less effort was required because of the lower sound pressure levels of the MR noise. Fast spoiled gradient-recalled-echo and echo-planar imaging sequences showed relatively favorable results with raised voice at operator location and loud speaking at patient location. The use of hearing protection slightly improved STNR.CONCLUSION: At 1.5 T, the level of MR noise requires that large vocal effort is used, at the operator and especially at the patient location. Depending on the specific MR sequence used, loud speaking or shouting is needed to achieve adequate bidirectional communication with the patient. The wearing of earplugs improves speech intelligibility."
"15200522","Hearing loss and perceptions of noise in the workplace among rural Australians.","OBJECTIVE: To compare measured hearing levels of individuals regularly exposed to noise in their workplace to self-reported and family-reported hearing loss. To compare the attitudes and preventative actions adopted by individuals who are more aware of the potential for hearing loss to less aware individuals.DESIGN: The project examined the perceptions of rural workers concerning noise, noise exposure and hearing. The subjects completed a 'Noise at Work' questionnaire and some demographic data at the time of audiometric testing.SETTING: The subjects were recruited when attending their rural health clinic for audiometric testing.PARTICIPANTS: Participants comprised 113 men and 23 women (20-65 years, mean = 39.6, SD = 11.4) working across a range of activities at different levels in their workplaces. The range in current employment was from 0.5 to 45 years (mean = 13.8, SD = 10.7).RESULTS: Hearing tests were compared with perceptions of noise annoyance, hearing damage risk and preventative action. Self- and family-reported hearing loss and conversational difficulties in noise correlated well with measured audiograms. Perceptions of workplace noise tended to be more positive if people felt they had hearing problems. There was no difference in preventative action between those who did and did not feel they had hearing problems. Both groups rated barriers to action and lack of self-efficacy in a similar negative way.CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for specific training to ensure that rural workers have skills to take more positive action in reducing noise exposure at work."
"15198383","Characteristics of acute acoustical trauma in the Finnish Defence Forces.","In spite of strict safety regulations concerning firearm shooting, several hundred conscripts still suffer acute acoustical trauma (AAT) in the Finnish Defence Forces (FDF) every year, resulting in symptoms such as tinnitus and/or hearing impairment. The causes leading to AAT, causative weapons and mode and level of hearing protection were analysed to find out why so many AATs still occur in the FDF. The material consisted of 119 patients of the total 163 AAT patients treated at the Central Military Hospital during the year 2000. In 87.5% of cases, the AATs occurred in unprotected ears. The most common causative weapon was the assault rifle. Most of the AATs occurred during combat training in the field. Immediately after the AAT. 46.7% of conscripts had hearing impairment and 94.2% tinnitus. Hearing loss, tinnitus or both were experienced by 45% of conscripts at the last follow-up. Careful planning of training exercises could probably prevent some but not all AATs."
"15143698","[Noise-induced hearing loss--factors affecting worker's decision to submit a disability claim].","Noise-induced hearing loss is recognized worldwide as a prevalent work-related morbidity and is the most common compensated occupational disease in Israel. Despite extended legislation, hearing conservation programs, surveillance and biological monitoring (by audiometry) of work sites and workers, the burden of this injury remains high. As a rule, afflicted workers refrain from filing compensation claims and do so only at later stages when both subjective and objective evidence of advanced hearing loss is present. We have evaluated the determinants that seem to influence the decision of an individual worker to file a claim. We found that the major determinants are subjective perception of the level of hearing disability and clinical symptoms such as: tinnitus (OR = 3.3 with CI 95% = 2.1 5.2), verbal communication disturbances (OR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.9-3.8), complaints of dizziness (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.4-2.5), severity of hearing impairment (by audiometry with OR = 1.04, 955 CI = 1.02-1.06) and musculoskeletal complaints (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.2-2.2). These findings attest to the relatively late stage in the development of noise-induced hearing loss at which workers file a claim for compensation and rehabilitation. In order to alleviate the burden of this injury in the future and encourage workers to approach the National Insurance Institute at an earlier stage, we suggest several ways of intervention and improving the awareness of all parties concerned."
"15137634","Health implication among occupational exposed workers in a chromium alloy factory, Thailand.","This study was conducted to assess the occupational exposure and its health impact on the chromium alloy workers. Environmental and biological monitoring, noise and audiometry measurements were done to evaluate the exposure levels in the factory. A total of 112 non-smoking workers were monitored from July 2001 to August 2002. The results showed that most of the chromium and lead exposures in the factory were below the ACGIH-TWA of 50 microg/m3 for chromium(VI) and OSHA-PEL of 50 microg/m3 for lead. The highest chromium (7.25 +/- 0.16 microg/m3) and lead (14.50 +/- 0.29 microg/m3) concentrations were measured in the vibro room. The results indicated that elevated concentrations of chromium and lead were found in both blood and urine samples especially in those areas which were characterized by poor ventilation. The metal contents in blood and urine samples were significantly correlated with airborne metal concentrations in the factory. The result demonstrated that blood and urinary levels among workers were associated with increasing age and duration of exposure. The background noise level of the factory ranged from 67.6 to 89.2 dBA and was frequently higher than the threshold limit value for noise (90 dBA). According to the audiometric test, the exposed workers showed signs of noise-induced hearing loss. Noise at work continued to be an important factor to hearing loss among exposed workers. In our statistical analysis, a significant hearing loss was established on age effect and year of exposure among the workforce."

"15035560","Modelling the risk of noise-induced hearing loss among military pilots.","Noise is a significant risk factor in aviation, especially in military aviation. Even though our earlier studies have shown that the risk of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) among military pilots is small and the monitoring of their hearing is effective, we still need to develop methods of assessing the risk of NIHL more effectively at both the general and individual levels. In addition, many other risk factors are considered to contribute to the development of hearing impairment. The novel NoiseScan data management system enables assessment of the risk of developing hearing impairment on the basis of known risk factors. This study investigates the risk of hearing impairment among Finnish Air Force pilots using reasonably accurate noise exposure data and other risk factors for hearing impairment. This risk is also compared with that of industrial workers, whose risk followed the ISO 1999 prediction. Hearing among Finnish military pilots turned out to be better than predicted by the ISO 1999 model. The industrial workers had a larger number of risk factors than the pilots. Owing to the small number of risk factors, the hearing of pilots corresponds to approximately the 80th percentile, being 9-13 dB better than the 50th percentile obtained with the industrial population."
"14992850","The contribution of focus groups in the evaluation of hearing conservation program (HCP) effectiveness.","PROBLEM: Exclusive reliance on such practices as policy review, audiometric testing audits, and noise surveillance to evaluate the effectiveness of workplace hearing conservation programs (HCP) fails to capture the impact of these programs as experienced by workers at the &quot;shop floor&quot; and offers little insight into the reasons and potential remedies for noted deficiencies.METHODS: A qualitative approach for evaluating industrial HCPs (and their various components) is discussed using three industrial populations as case studies. For each study population, this paper illustrates how focus groups, comprised of line workers and supervisors, were used to clarify and augment information gathered through more traditional program assessments to provide a more enriched picture of hearing conservation practices. Descriptive data on plant hearing conservation program practices at each plant are presented with a comparison of proactive elements of each program relative to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hearing Conservation Amendment (HCA) requirement and to internal plant policy.RESULTS: Yearly program evaluation with input from all end-users is important in the process of hearing loss prevention. The qualitative assessment outlined in this paper serves as a basis for future quantitative assessments of HCP effectiveness using hearing threshold data and noise exposure assessments to examine changes in hearing levels as a function of noise exposure and other risk factors for hearing loss."

When subjects were tested with a speech discrimination battery (Central Institute of the Deaf, Spondee Word lists), there was a significant difference (p value of 0.04, using the Kruskall-Wallis ANOVA test) between the two active and the passive defenders. However, no significant difference was found between the two types of active hearing defenders.CONCLUSION: Active hearing defenders are an acceptable and efficacious means of hearing protection in noisy environments."

The level of noise exposure in the venues where they work has also been studied using Ametek Mk-3 audio dosimeters. Three members of the study group showed clear evidence of noise-induced hearing loss on audiometry, 70 per cent reported temporary threshold shift after sessions and 74 per cent reported tinnitus. Sound levels of up to 108 dB(A) were recorded in the nightclubs. The average level for a typical session was 96 dB(A) which is above the level at which the provision of ear protection is mandatory for employers in industry. It can be concluded that DJs are at substantial risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss and noise exposure in nightclubs frequently exceeds safe levels."

His ear canal has a diameter of more than 1.3 cm. and determine a peculiar pattern of hearing loss, similar to the noise induced one, but chiefly in the speech frequencies. According to experimental and human studies we speculate that in this patient the peculiar morphology of the audiogram, with the low or mean frequencies maximally affected, may been explained by a synergistic effect of solvents mixture in conjunction with noise exposure and a high ear canal volume."

"14726777","Effects of booster interventions on factory workers' use of hearing protection.","BACKGROUND: The provision of reinforcements or boosters to interventions is seen as a logical approach to enhancing or maintaining desired behavior. Empirical studies, however, have not confirmed the effectiveness of boosters nor assessed the optimum number of boosters or the timing for their delivery.OBJECTIVES: This randomized controlled trial contrasted the effect of four booster conditions (a). 30 days; (b). 90 days; (c). 30 and at 90 days; and (d). no boosters of the intervention to increase the use of hearing protection devices (HPDs).METHODS: A total of 1325 factory workers completed a computerized questionnaire and were randomly assigned to one of three computer-based (tailored, nontailored predictor-based, or control) multimedia interventions designed to increase the use of hearing protection devices. After the intervention, colorful boosters specific to the type of training received were mailed to workers' homes. Posttest measures of use were administered at the time of their next annual audiogram 6 to 18 months after the intervention. RESULTS Repeated measures of analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a significant main effect for the booster (after 30 days) in the group that received tailored training (F[3442] = 2.722; p =.04). However, in the assessment of the interaction between time (pretest and posttest) and boosters (four groups), the ANOVA did not find significant differences in hearing protection device use for any of the training groups. To assess for significant differences between groups, post hoc comparisons were conducted at the pretest and posttest for the total sample and for the subsample of workers who reported using hearing protection devices less than 100% of the time needed. Sheffé contrasts by intervention group, gender, ethnicity, and hearing ability found no significant changes in the mean use of hearing protection devices for the booster groups.CONCLUSIONS: Although the provision of boosters represented a considerable commitment of resources, their use was not effective in this study. However, it would be premature to eliminate boosters of interventions. Further study is needed to explore the effects of different booster types for increasing the use of hearing protection devices, and to assess carefully the effects of boosters on other health behaviors in studies with controlled designs."

"16370263","Hearing loss in military aviation and other trades: investigation of prevalence and risk factors.","INTRODUCTION: Continuous increase in the cost of claims for noise-induced hearing loss in Canadian Forces personnel prompted a review of hearing conservation practices. Investigations comprised retrospective analyses of hearing test results and a prospective survey of risk factors for hearing loss.METHOD: There were 1057 individuals working in 107 air, land, and sea trades who contributed their current and first hearing test results. Subjects completed a 64-item questionnaire relating to demographics, occupational and non-occupational noise exposure history, training in and use of hearing protection, and non-noise risk factors, including head injury, ear disease, medications, and solvent exposure. Subject recruitment, hearing assessment, and questionnaire distribution were carried out by military personnel. Apparatus and protocols for hearing testing conformed to current clinical practice.RESULTS: Prevalence of moderate to severe hearing loss progressed with age, with hearing thresholds in those over 45 yr ranging broadly from normal to over 70 dB HL. Unprotected exposure to noise and solvents appeared to be the likely determinates of adverse outcome. Head injury, ear disease, and the use of ototoxic medications had minimal impact. The data for individuals in 17 selected trades in the 3 environments modeled that of the total sample.DISCUSSION: Responses to the questionnaire suggested that training on noise hazard and selection and use of hearing protection were inadequate. Hearing protection was reported to be incompatible with other gear, uncomfortable, and an impediment to communication. Approaches for upgrading hearing conservation strategies, including the creation of end-user focus groups, were considered."
"16360818","Physician hearing loss.","PURPOSE: Hearing is an important sense for physicians, making communication and stethoscope use possible, yet not much is known about the impact of hearing loss on professional function. The purpose of this study was to explore hearing-related issues affecting physicians.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We administered a hearing test and questionnaire to 107 physicians and medical students.RESULTS: The proportion of physicians reporting trouble with their hearing increased with age, reaching almost 100% in those older than 60 years. Audiometric hearing loss also increased with age. Perceived hearing trouble was significantly associated with audiometric hearing loss, yet 46% of physicians with hearing loss described their hearing as good. Older physicians more frequently reported difficulty communicating with patients, staff, and colleagues owing to hearing problems (P = .007). Reported stethoscope difficulties did not significantly increase with age; there was no association with hearing thresholds. No physician reported use of electronic stethoscopes or hearing aids. Noise exposures were common, yet 51% of respondents never used hearing protection. Younger physicians were less likely to use protection (P = .002).CONCLUSION: Physicians lose hearing with age but may not notice or report the loss. Physician hearing loss is associated with difficulty communicating with patients, staff, and colleagues. Neither age nor hearing level predicts problems with stethoscope use; possible explanations include a training effect or denial. Many physicians, especially younger ones, never use hearing protection around noise. Strategies to recognize and reduce the impact of hearing loss on professional function throughout a physician's career deserve greater attention."

It will present the results of audiometric screening among a group of people in this community and their self reported risk factors of hearing loss. Different risk factors experienced by men and women will be compared. Two surveys were conducted in a small Queensland rural community. The first survey gathered information relating to chronic diseases among 604 people using a telephone interview method. The second survey assessed the level of hearing among 64 people who presented themselves for audiometric screening, their history of exposure to loud noise and their previous use of hearing protective measures. A higher rate of &quot;industrial deafness&quot; was reported (110.75 per 1,000 population) than the 1995 National rate (95.2 per 1,000 population). Of 64 people who attended the audiometric assessment, 60 (93.8%) had some level of hearing loss using the 2000 International Standard of hearing level (ISO 7029: 2000) taking age and gender into account. However, 15 persons (23.4%) perceived that they had good hearing. When compared to ISO 7029: 2000 standard, men and women had a similar pattern of hearing loss. Compared to men, a lower percentage of women were exposed to different sources of loud noise and were less likely to use hearing protection devices."
"16281759","[Annual rate of development of noise induced hearing loss in exposed workers].","The rate of development of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) in a group of 150 male workers exposed to industrial noise of over 85 dBA, was compared with the rate of a group of 40 unexposed workers. It was found that while the average annual rate of decline in the exposed group (for frequencies 1000-4000 HZ) was about 1 dB/year, it was less than 0.5 dB/ year in the unexposed group. These findings attest to the need to improve current prevention modalities (hearing conservation programs). In addition, the findings point to the importance of guaranteeing the accuracy of the audiometric tests as the usual &quot;measurement error&quot; is often greater than the expected real change (1-2 dB/year).

Noise levels in working environments were measured in 34 factories. Of those measured, two (6%), eight (24%) and 24 (71%) factories were classified into control classes I, II and III, respectively, according to guidelines established for the prevention of noise-related disorders. Furthermore, personal exposure levels to noise were measured for 23 workers. Twenty-one (91%) of those workers measured were exposed to 85 dB(A) or higher, (the occupational exposure limit for an 8-hour exposure period). Maximum exposure levels were found to be at 102 dB (A). Hearing tests were then conducted on 97 male workers at those 36 factory sites. Twenty (21%), 30 (31%) and 10 (10%) of the workers measured were classified into a &quot;precursory symptom group&quot;, a &quot;slight hearing loss group&quot; and a &quot;medium to serious hearing loss group&quot;, respectively, based on the aforementioned guidelines. It was found that as workers' ages increased, the percentage of workers having some degree of hearing loss increased. Specifically, it was found that there was some level of hearing loss for 93% of those studied aged in their 50's, and up to 100% in those aged in their 60's."

This report summarizes hearing evaluations through March 31, 2003.METHODS: Occupational examinations included a medical history, limited physical examination, and tests for medical effects from specific hazards, including audiometric testing. Hearing thresholds by frequency for DOE workers were compared to age-standardized thresholds among an external comparison population of industrial workers with noise exposures &lt;80 dBA. Multivariate analyses were used to explore the risk of hearing impairment by duration of construction trade work and self-reported noise exposure, while controlling for potential confounders such as age, race, sex, smoking, elevated serum cholesterol, hypertension, solvent exposures, and recreational noise exposures.RESULTS: Hearing thresholds among DOE workers were much higher than observed in a comparison population of industrial workers with low noise exposures. Overall, 59.7% of workers examined were found to have material hearing impairment by NIOSH criteria. Age, duration of construction work, smoking, and self-reported noise exposure increased the risk of hearing loss. The risk of material hearing impairment was significantly elevated for construction trade workers compared to the external comparison population (odds-ratio = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.3-2.1) and increased with the duration of trade work.CONCLUSIONS: These medical screening programs confirm worker concerns about risks for hearing loss and the need for hearing conservation programs for construction workers, with emphasis on the prevention of noise exposures."
"16240590","[Noise-induced hypoacusia in maintenance workers of high voltage electric lines].","Noise-induced hypoacusia continues to represent an important issue in Occupational Medicine in relation to epidemiology, diagnostics, medicolegal issues and occupation related compensation claims. We present the clinical and audiometric findings of 45 maintenance workers of high tension electric lines, undergoing medical surveillance. Noise-induced hearing loss was diagnosed in 49% of cases (&quot;pure&quot; in 27% and mixed--with the concurrence of other causes--in 22% of cases). These unexpected data indicate that electric lines maintenance should be considered a high risk occupation for noise-induced damage, and confirm the need of enforcing current protective laws."
"16219153","Signal recognition and hearing protectors with normal and impaired hearing.","Recognition of acoustic signals when perception is subject to interference from noise has already been extensively studied. In this study the influence of hearing protectors (HP) (plugs, muffs) and hearing loss on signal recognition is examined. Different spectrums and levels of the noise are also included. The test results are shown as the masked threshold for the signals heard and identified. In the case of normally hearing subjects a frequency-independent HP (plug) improves hearing performance, while frequency-dependent HP (muffs) tends to worsen it, especially with low-frequency noise. Hearing losses even worsen hearing performance when plugs are worn. Design suggestions are made to optimise signal recognition. Minimum signal-to-noise ratio and the use of HP are discussed."
"16201210","The impact of low-frequency noise on human mental performance.","OBJECTIVES: There is a growing body of data showing that low frequency noise (LFN), defined as broadband noise with dominant content of low frequencies (10-250 Hz) differs in its nature from other environmental noises at comparable levels. The aim of the study was to investigate whether exposure to LFN at levels normally occurring in the industrial control rooms can influence human mental performance (e.g., visual functions, concentration, continuous and selective attention) and subjective well-being.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 96 female and male volunteers, aged 19-27 years, categorized in terms of sensitivity to LFN. They worked with four standardized psychological tests (Signal Detection, Stroop Color-Word, Comparing of Names, and Continuous Attention) during exposure to LFN or broadband noise without dominant low frequency content (reference noise) at a level of 50 dB(A). Each subject was studied only once at randomly-assigned exposure conditions.RESULTS: In the Comparing of Names Test, the subjects, regardless of the LFN sensitivity, showed tendency to make more errors during exposure to LFN than in the reference noise, and in the Signal Detection Test, they generally reacted faster (had shorter median detection time). In those noise conditions, however, the high-sensitive to LFN subjects, showed tendency to work less precisely (achieved lower number of correct responses in the Signal Detection Test) compared with the low-sensitive ones, while in the reference noise there was no difference related to noise sensitivity. The subjects categorized as high-sensitive to LFN also showed poorer performance than others during exposure to LFN in the Stroop Color-Word Test (a significant interaction between noise and noise sensitivity in case of reading interference index) and in the Continuous Attention Test (a tendency to more erroneous reactions).CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that LFN at moderate levels might adversely affect visual functions, concentration, continuous and selective attention, especially in the high-sensitive to LFN subjects."
"16177883","Potential occupational health problems for dentists in Flanders, Belgium.","The aim of this study was to gather data on occupational health effects among Flemish dentists. A questionnaire on various potential health effects was sent out to randomly selected Flemish dentists. Pilot experimental studies were performed on hearing and sensory function of the fingers on small groups of dentists. Audiometric data of both ears, gathered with an interval of 10 years, were analysed. Sensory tests of the fingers were performed for dominant and non-dominant hands in relation to exposure time to (ultra)sonic equipment. Positive responses for the questionnaire were as follows: low back pain, 54% (stress-correlated); vision problems, 52.3% (age-correlated); infections, 9%; allergies, 22.5% (mainly latex); stress level was scored 7 on a scale from 0 to 10; diminished sensitivity of the fingertips, 6% and auditory disorders, 19.6%. Pilot audiometric data showed a hearing loss at 4,000 Hz for the left ear, presumably indicative of occupational noise trauma. The two-point discrimination ability of the dominant hand tended to diminish in line with the number of years of practice. Dentists in Flanders were found to suffer from various health-related problems. More elaborate studies are required to provide more details on the risks for occupational hearing impairment and vibration hand neuropathy and to determine whether the problems described were related to the practice of dentistry."
"16112827","Distortion-product otoacoustic emission spectra and high-resolution audiometry in noise-induced hearing loss.","Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) elicited by 60dB SPL pure tones at f1 and f2 were collected at 2f1-f2, in 1/10th octave steps, in a sample of 36 ears from 27 patients with noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). They were analyzed in the frequency domain against the outcome of high-resolution pure-tone audiometry, performed with the help of a Békésy sweep-frequency automatic audiometer. The characteristics of DPOAE level plots as a function of frequency (the so-called DP-grams), relative to the DPOAE levels of a control age-matched group, were compared to their alleged counterparts on the audiograms, i.e., the lower and upper frequency boundaries of the interval with hearing loss. Ears with NIHL split into two subgroups, one (n = 25) with a notch in the DP-gram such that its lower boundary matched the lower limit of the audiometric notch (linear regression with a slope of 0.91, r(2) = 0.644, p &lt; 0.001). Likewise, when it existed, its upper boundary matched its upper counterpart on the audiogram (linear regression with a slope of 0.96, r(2) = 0.89, p &lt; 0.001). In this respect, DP-grams performed better than transient-evoked OAE spectra, which exhibited poor correlations with audiogram patterns. The second subgroup (n = 11) exhibited normal DPOAEs at all frequencies despite audiometric losses similar to those of the first subgroup. In all cases, DPOAE levels were poor predictors of the degree of hearing losses. It is hypothesized that NIHL in the second subgroup involves inner hair cells or auditory neurons, instead of outer hair cells in the first subgroup. Provided NIHL affected outer hair cells, DP-grams provided a comparatively accurate predictor of the spectral extent of hearing loss."
"16111421","Extended high-frequency audiometry in patients with acoustic trauma.","OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine extended high-frequency (EHF) hearing in patients with acoustic trauma.DESIGN: A prospective, case-control study in a group of soldiers with acoustic trauma caused by shooting practice during basic training.SETTING: Tertiary referral centre.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 39 young soldiers hospitalized for hearing loss and tinnitus following exposure to weapon impulse noise were studied. Conventional audiometry in the frequency range 0.25-8 kHz and EHF audiometry in the frequency range 9-20 kHz were performed, both on admittance and before discharge. Thirty healthy recruits of similar age and sex were used as controls.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pure-tone threshold changes documented by conventional and EHF audiometry.RESULTS: The most significant differences in pure-tone thresholds on initial testing were found in the frequency range 0.25-11.2 kHz, and especially in the 4-8 kHz region. Reduction in thresholds across most frequencies was observed after treatment, although recovery was partial in most cases.CONCLUSIONS: The EHF audiometry adds no significant additional information to conventional pure-tone audiometry in assessing and monitoring noise-induced hearing loss."
"16026021","Occupational exposure to noise and hypertension in pilots.","The role of occupational exposure to noise as a hypertension risk factor has not been established sufficiently. The aim of the study is to evaluate whether chronic exposure to different levels of noise in two groups of pilots, operating with two types of aircraft, could be a risk for hypertension, what relevance the parameters (intensity, duration and type) of exposure can have and, lastly, whether there are any links between hearing impairment and hypertension. After excluding pilots with confounding factors, a study was made of 77 male pilots of turboprop planes (group A) and 224 male pilots of jet aircraft (group B), matched by age and working life. Blood pressure (supine and standing positions) and heart rate were measured. Electrocardiogram, stress tests on a cycle ergometer, sound-level measurement and audiometric tests were also done. Pilots of group A were exposed to Leq of 93 dBA while pilots of group B were exposed to the Leq of 79 dBA. Significant results in group A compared to group B were found between heart rate, blood pressure, drop in blood pressure, parameters (intensity, duration and type) of exposure to noise and between hearing damage and hypertension. The findings suggest that chronic exposure to noise is a risk factor for blood hypertension in pilots exposed to high noise levels, and that the drop in blood pressure may be a sign of more sensitive effect of noise on blood pressure, according to other studies in literature."
"16021464","Hearing loss among operating engineers in American construction industry.","OBJECTIVE: Occupational noise exposure and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) among construction workers has long been recognized as a problem in the United States, yet little is known about the prevalence of NIHL among American construction workers. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of hearing loss among operating engineers (OEs) who operate heavy construction machinery.METHOD: As a part of hearing protection intervention, an audiometric test was conducted for both ears at frequencies 0.5 through 8 kHz in the soundproof booth. Prior to the audiometric test, a paper-pencil pre-hearing test questionnaire was administered and an otoscopic examination was completed. Prevalence of hearing loss was determined based on hearing threshold levels (HTLs) in the worst ear with a low fence of 25 dB.RESULT: A total of 623 workers were included in the analysis and they were predominantly middle-aged Caucasian males (mean age = 43 years, Caucasian = 90%, male = 92%). Over 60% of OEs showed hearing loss in the noise-sensitive higher frequencies of 4 and 6 kHz. The rate of hearing loss was particularly higher among workers who reported longer years of working in the construction industry. Workers showed significantly poorer hearing in the left ear, and a typical characteristic of NIHL, a V-notch at 4 or 6 kHz, was not shown in this population. Thirty-eight percent reported ringing/buzzing in the ear and 62% indicated having problems in understanding what people say in loud noise. Average reported use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) was 48% of the time they were required to be used. Significant inverse relationship was found between higher frequency (4-6 kHz) hearing loss and use of HPDs (r =-0.134, p &lt; 0.001). Workers using HPDs more had significantly better hearing than those who did not.CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated a significant NIHL problem and low use of HPDs in OEs. An effective hearing conservation program, including a periodic audiometric testing and hearing protection intervention, for this study population should be in place."
"16011050","Screened and unscreened hearing threshold levels for the adult population: results from the Nord-Trøndelag Hearing Loss Study.","This paper presents normative data of hearing threshold levels of a population screened with various criteria, as compared to unscreened population data. Computer-controlled pure-tone audiometry was administered to the adult population in Nord-Trøndelag County, Norway, during 1995-1997. The 51975 participants also provided questionnaire information about occupational and leisure noise exposure, previous ear infections, and head injury. While screening had little effect on the median hearing threshold levels of young adults, there was a substantial effect when screening men above 40 years of age for a history of noise exposure. Screening for known ear-related disorders and diseases resulted in small effects on the mean hearing threshold levels The median hearing thresholds of both the screened and the unscreened sample exceeded the age and sex specific thresholds specified by the ISO 7029."
"15989167","Ethnic differences in predictors of hearing protection behavior between Black and White workers.","The purpose of the study is to determine whether there are ethnic differences in predictors of hearing protection behavior between Black and White workers. The Predictors of Use of Hearing Protection Model (PUHPM) derived from Pender's Health Promotion Model (Pender, 1987) was used as a conceptual model. A total of 2,119 (297 Blacks, 1,822 Whites) were included in the analysis. Internal consistency of instrument items was assessed using theta reliability estimates. Significant predictors of the use of hearing protective devices (HPDs) for Black and White workers and differences in predictors between the two groups were examined using multiple regression with interaction terms. Ethnic differences in scale or individual item scores were assessed using chi-square and t-test analyses. Different factors influenced hearing protection behavior among Black and White workers. The model was much less predictive of Blacks' hearing protection behavior than Whites' (R2 = .12 vs. .36). Since the PUHPM was not as effective in predicting hearing protection behavior for Blacks as for Whites, future studies are needed to expand the PUHPM through qualitative study and to develop culturally appropriate models to identify factors that better predict hearing protection behavior as a basis for developing effective interventions."
"15937413","Hearing levels of firefighters: risk of occupational noise-induced hearing loss assessed by cross-sectional and longitudinal data.","OBJECTIVE: It is well known that firefighters face serious risk to their health and safety in the performance of their duties. To determine whether individuals who work as firefighters sustain occupational noise-induced hearing losses, we evaluated results of hearing tests completed by firefighters and compared them with age-matched, non-occupationally exposed groups of individuals.DESIGN: The results of annual audiometric testing and a related questionnaire collected as part of a company-wide hearing conservation program were obtained from two large urban fire departments. The records from 12,609 tests conducted over an 11-year period were evaluated. Hearing levels obtained from the tests were compared with age-matched control populations from an American national standard, and a longitudinal study comparing the rate of hearing loss to that expected due to presbycusis alone was conducted.RESULTS: Comparisons of the data to the national standard indicated that firefighters do not exhibit excessive loss of hearing compared with age-matched, non-occupationally exposed control subjects. The longitudinal study that examined the regression of firefighters' hearing with age compared with the expected presbycasic regression function indicated that the hearing of firefighters in the study declined over the 7-year period at a rate that was less than that expected due to age alone.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this large-scale, cross-sectional, and longitudinal study indicate that firefighters are not at risk for occupational noise-induced hearing loss, even though they work nonstandard shifts and are occasionally exposed to high levels of noise. The results are consistent with the findings but not the conclusions of several other studies of firefighters' hearing."
"15913156","Is there a relevant effect of noise and smoking on hearing? A population-based aging study.","The objectives of the present study were to evaluate both the respective and combined effects of occupational noise exposure and smoking on hearing, taking age into consideration. The evaluation was conducted using 1478 subjects without a history of ear disease out of a population-based sample of 2267 adults, aged 40 79 years. Pure-tone audiometry and a questionnaire were administered. A deleterious effect of noise exposure on hearing was significantly observed in both genders at many frequencies after adjustment for age, income, and education. The smoking habit alone significantly affected hearing deterioration at 4000 Hz in noise-unexposed males. The combined effect of noise and smoking was not interactive but additive. A dose-response effect of smoking on hearing loss was observed in middle-aged males without noise exposure. Smoking and noise exposure were associated with hearing loss respectively.. This result is noteworthy for the preservation of good hearing especially at the beginning of aging."
"15907054","Auditory evoked functions in ground crew working in high noise environment of Mumbai airport.","The continuous exposure to the relatively high level of noise in the surroundings of an airport is likely to affect the central pathway of the auditory system as well as the cognitive functions of the people working in that environment. The Brainstem Auditory Evoked Responses (BAER), Mid Latency Response (MLR) and P300 response of the ground crew employees working in Mumbai airport were studied to evaluate the effects of continuous exposure to high level of noise of the surroundings of the airport on these responses. BAER, P300 and MLR were recorded by using a Nicolet Compact-4 (USA) instrument. Audiometry was also monitored with the help of GSI-16 Audiometer. There was a significant increase in the peak III latency of the BAER in the subjects exposed to noise compared to controls with no change in their P300 values. The exposed group showed hearing loss at different frequencies. The exposure to the high level of noise caused a considerable decline in the auditory conduction upto the level of the brainstem with no significant change in conduction in the midbrain, subcortical areas, auditory cortex and associated areas. There was also no significant change in cognitive function as measured by P300 response."

Clinical and occupational data on 182 workers who were active between November 2001 and March 2002 were obtained from the company's Hearing Conservation Program and analyzed. In order to characterize the noise exposure status within the work environment, the acoustic classifications from the operating units of the client companies were used, due to difficulty in quantification at an individual level. Associations between these cases and variables such as age, length of service in the company, length of exposure to occupational noise and degree of use of individual protection equipment were tested by means of prevalence ratios and logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: The prevalence of cases suggestive of NIHL was 15.9% and significant associations (p&lt;0.05) were identified from multivariate analysis between these cases and the variables of age and degree of use of individual protection equipment.CONCLUSIONS: The results found contribute towards better understanding of the behavior of some of the main characteristics of NIHL, in a particular situation of the organizing of work that is relatively common in the Brazilian industrial context."
"15837852","Prospective noise induced changes to hearing among construction industry apprentices.","AIMS: To characterise the development of noise induced damage to hearing.METHODS: Hearing and noise exposure were prospectively monitored among a cohort of newly enrolled construction industry apprentices and a comparison group of graduate students, using standard pure tone audiometry and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). A total of 328 subjects (632 ears) were monitored annually an average of 3.4 times. In parallel to these measures, noise exposure and hearing protection device (HPD) use were extensively monitored during construction work tasks. Recreational/non-occupational exposures also were queried and monitored in subgroups of subjects. Trade specific mean exposure L(eq) levels, with and without accounting for the variable use of hearing protection in each trade, were calculated and used to group subjects by trade specific exposure level. Mixed effects models were used to estimate the change in hearing outcomes over time for each exposure group.RESULTS: Small but significant exposure related changes in DPOAEs over time were observed, especially at 4 kHz with stimulus levels (L1) between 50 and 75 dB, with less clear but similar patterns observed at 3 kHz. After controlling for covariates, the high exposure group had annual changes in 4 kHz emissions of about 0.5 dB per year. Pure tone audiometric thresholds displayed only slight trends towards increased threshold levels with increasing exposure groups. Some unexpected results were observed, including an apparent increase in DPOAEs among controls over time, and improvement in behavioural thresholds among controls at 6 kHz only.CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that construction apprentices in their first three years of work, with average noise exposures under 90 dBA, have measurable losses of hearing function. Despite numerous challenges in using DPOAEs for hearing surveillance in an industrial setting, they appear somewhat more sensitive to these early changes than is evident with standard pure tone audiometry."
"15828636","Hearing thresholds among young professional divers: a 6-year longitudinal study.","INTRODUCTION: Diving is associated with pressure effects and noise exposure that can impair hearing. We were interested in finding out whether changes in hearing thresholds were related to cumulative exposure in young professional divers.METHODS: In a prospective follow-up design, we studied a cohort of 47 men from the beginning of their education as professional divers at a mean age of 25.6 yr (range 18-38 yr). They had audiograms taken at baseline, after 1 and 3 yr, and finally after 6 yr, during which they performed 40-1458 (median 184) sea dives, most of them to a depth of 10 m or less. The hearing tests measured pure tone air conduction thresholds at 0.25-8.0 kHz in a sound-treated booth. Annual change of hearing thresholds were calculated by fitting linear regression lines to individual data. For purposes of analysis, the divers were divided into two groups, low-exposure (199 or fewer dives, n = 26) and high-exposure (200 or more dives, n = 21).RESULTS: Hearing was better in the divers than in the general population at baseline and follow-up. At 6 yr, significant reductions were found in the divers' hearing at 4 kHz and 8 kHz. Significant increases in thresholds were found at 0.5, 2, 3, and 6 kHz for the right ear and 3, 4, and 6 kHz for the left ear. The annual change at 4 kHz was 0.95 dB in the left ear and 0.18 dB in the right ear (p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in hearing changes between the high- and low-exposure groups.DISCUSSION: The results suggest that a mild hearing impairment can occur in young professional divers due to occupational and other noise exposure."

Work histories, recreational exposures, protective equipment, medical histories, alcohol, smoking, and demographics were collected by questionnaire. Jet fuel, solvent, and noise exposure data were collected from records. Fuel exposure estimates were less than 34% of the OSHA Threshold Limit Values.RESULTS: Subjects with 3 years of jet fuel exposure had a 70% increase in adjusted odds of hearing loss (OR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.14-2.53) and the odds increased to 2.41 (95% CI = 1.04-5.57) for 12 years of noise and fuel exposure.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that jet fuel has a toxic affect on the auditory system."
"15703148","Instruction and the improvement of hearing protector performance.","Too often, in spite of the encouragement of those who advocate the removal of noise from the workplace as the preferred solution to noise exposure, hearing protectors are provided as the first line of defence against noise. Unfortunately hearing protectors are too often supplied with no real instruction or education in their use. This degrades their performance considerably. In this project the attenuation performance of one particular model of earplug was compared with and without instructions to test subjects. The instructions given were the most basic as commonly supplied on the plastic packaging containing the plugs. The attenuation performance (SLC80) of the plugs with the instructions was 16 dB greater than without the instructions. Overall performance was improved in every octave band with smaller associated standard deviations. The comparison showed that even with a very modest amount of instruction attenuation performance can be significantly improved."
"15703143","Does the presentation of audiometric test data have a positive effect on the perceptions of workplace noise and noise exposure avoidance?","Research and 'common knowledge' has for many years accepted that education and feedback supplied to individuals during and immediately after workplace health assessments provides valuable information to workers about their health. Further, if more relevant and detailed information could be supplied then awareness and preventative action may increase proportionately. This research carried out with a rural Australian population has shown that preventative action did not increase in proportion to a corresponding increase in the amount and variety of information provided in connection with hearing health status. Two research groups underwent hearing tests, both with pure tone audiometry (PTA) while the second group also underwent otoacoustic emission (OAE) testing. Test results were presented to the subjects at the conclusion of their test session. An analysis of questionnaire responses at six week and twelve months follow up showed that more information did not result in increased preventative action. Barriers seem to exist such that individuals feel that they are not able to effectively act to reduce overall noise exposure. While self-efficacy initially increased, it declined to close to its initial value over the longer period. Other measures such as perceived susceptibility to hearing loss and the benefits of exposure reduction significantly increased and remained at the same increased level after twelve months. So, while overall awareness of noise and the risks of exposure were increased after both types of hearing test there was no increased hearing health benefit due to additional testing and hearing information."
"15699090","Joint effects of smoking, noise exposure and age on hearing loss.","BACKGROUND: Smoking has been shown to have adverse effects on hearing, but it's unclear whether smoking interacts with known causes of hearing loss such as noise exposure and ageing.AIMS: To examine the hypothesis that smoking, noise and age jointly affect hearing acuity.METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out in 535 male adult workers of a metal processing factory. Pure-tone audiometric tests were utilized to assess hearing loss. Noise exposure assessment was based on a job exposure matrix constructed with industrial hygienist scoring and job titles. Each participant answered questionnaires about socio-demographic, life-style, occupational and health-related data. Analysis of the possible underlying biological model was undertaken assessing departures from additivity using measures of the size of the interaction present.RESULTS: Age and occupational noise exposures were, separately, positively associated with hearing loss. For all the factors combined the estimated effect on hearing loss was higher than the sum of the effects from each isolated variable, especially for smoking and noise among those 20-40 years of age, and for smoking and age among those non-exposed to occupational noise.CONCLUSIONS: The synergistic effect of smoking, noise exposure and age on hearing loss, found in this study, is consistent with the biological interaction. Furthermore, it is possible that distinct ototoxic substances in the chemical composition of mainstream smoke may synergistically affect hearing when in combination with noise exposure, which needs to be examined in future studies."

Noise level data and observational data as to the number of staff present were obtained and recorded at 5-min intervals over three consecutive days.RESULTS: Results of noise level analysis indicated that mean noise level within this clinical area was 42.28 dB with acute spikes reaching 70 dB(A). The lowest noise level attained was that of 36 dB(A) during the period midnight to 7 a.m. Non-parametric testing, using Spearman's Rho (two-tailed), found a positive relationship between the number of staff present and the level of noise recorded, indicating that the presence of hospital personnel strongly influences the level of noise within this area.RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Whilst the results of this may seem self-evident in many respects the problems of excessive noise production and the exposure to it for patients, hospital personnel and relatives alike continues unabated. What must be of concern is the psychophysiological effects excessive noise exposure has on individuals, for example, decreased wound healing, sleep deprivation and cardiovascular stimulation."

An audiometry screening test (air conduction) was performed. Workers with hearing loss were submitted to liminal tonal audiometry air &amp; bone conduction and speech audiometry tests using an audiometer AD-28 (Interacoustics). All subjects studied were submitted to a visual inspection of the external acoustic meatus.RESULTS: One hundred and fifty two workers were examined; mean age was 32 years (SD = 8.6); average occupational noise exposure was of 8.3 years (SD = 6.8). Audiometries demonstrated that 48.0% (n = 73) had some type of hearing loss. Among the workers with hearing loss, 50.0% had results compatible with noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL); 41.0% with incipient noise induced hearing loss, 5.0% with sensorineural hearing loss (all except NIHL) and 4.0% with conductive and mixed hearing losses. Among workers with NIHL, 57.1% had bilateral involvement, 17.1% in the right ear and 25.7% in the left ear. Among those with incipient NIHL, 13.9% were bilateral, 19.4% were only in the right ear and 66.7% were only in the left ear.CONCLUSION: Abnormal audiograms were found in 48.0% of the sample. Among those with hearing loss, the predominant cause was NIHL, followed by those classified as having incipient noise induced hearing loss. Hearing loss usually started at 6 kHz, frequently in the left ear."

These were compared with a formal audiometrical assessment at a university clinic.METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective study was made of 95 cases of noise induced hearing loss. A total of 78 individuals were investigated by an otolaryngologist and 70 by workplace audiometry. Using workplace audiometry, 27% of the tests showed a reduction in working capacity of at least 20%. In only five of these was a specialist opinion sought within a year. In 50%, this took longer than 5 years. A comparison of audiometric data from expert opinion revealed that there was conformity in only 47% with workplace audiometry and 48% with otolaryngologist testing. In some cases (27% workplace and 33% ENT practice), the measured hearing loss and calculation of disability exceeded that determined by the experts.CONCLUSIONS: The results of workplace audiometry demonstrated that hearing loss was frequently reported only after the workers had received a disability of at least 20%. Possible reasons for discrepancies in audiological testing might be the exaggeration of hearing loss by the worker, insufficient recovery time after noise exposure, or inexperienced audiologists. Our data show that audiometric testing in workplace audiometry, as well as in ENT practice, often reveal a higher disability rating compared to formal audiological (university) assessment, even if these discrepancies do not reach statistical significance."

This group was classified and internally stratified in subgroups of &quot;exposed&quot; and &quot;controls&quot; according to cumulative working time as bus drivers. Their exposure to noise and vibration was assessed. The association between noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and the set of explanatory variables was analyzed through logistic regression.RESULTS: The average (+/- standard deviation) weekly noise exposure of front-engine bus drivers was 83.6 +/- 1.9 dB(A), while rear-engine bus drivers were exposed to 77.0 +/- 1.1 dB(A). The weighted average of vibration acceleration was 0.85/m(2). In the best adjusted model, the multivariable analysis showed that age (&gt;44; OR=2.54; 95% CI=1.15-5.62), diabetes (OR=5.46; 95% CI=0.95-31.4), and the level of noise emission [&gt;86.8 dB(A); OR=2.76; 95% CI=1.24-6.15] were risk factors for NIHL. In another model studied, WBV exposure was significant in determining NIHL.CONCLUSIONS: Bus drivers were exposed to significant WBV levels. The noise exposure was more pronounced in front engine than in rear-engine vehicles. No association between WBV exposure and NIHL was observed and no interaction was found between WBV and noise exposure. Further studies are required as other model indicated an association between WBV and NIHL."

Nevertheless, we have observed that withdrawal of smoking stops the progression on hearing loss in occupational groups with an acoustic exposition lesser than 80 dB SPL. Actually, there is not an unique ethiologic hypothesis."
"17175514","Evaluation of noise attenuation and verbal communication capabilities using three ear insert hearing protection systems among airport maintenance personnel.","The goal of this project was to determine whether one type of earplug would allow a user to hear communication in a noisy environment better than two other types of earplugs. The three types of earplugs studied are newly available on the market. Sonomax SonoCustoms are custom fitted to the user. E-A-R Push-Ins are the newest form of foam earplugs, and Howard Leight SmartFits have an adaptable shape. One of the earplug manufacturers claimed to have improved verbal communications due to the design of the earplug. We hypothesized that the type of earplug providing better communication properties would have lower attenuation around the communication frequencies compared with the other types. To test this hypothesis, we used speech intelligibility and attenuation tests in the laboratory on 26 subjects, and real-time video exposure monitoring in the field (airport maintenance personnel) for visual communication cues. ANCOVA was used to analyze the data from the laboratory study. The type of earplug worn was not significant in the model (p-value 0.0849), nor was attenuation of the earplug (p-value 0.2379). Further analysis showed that attenuation did not differ significantly among earplugs (p-value 0.5903). Logistic regression was used to analyze the data from the field study. Again, the type of earplug was not significant in the model (p-value 0.0965). A comfort questionnaire determined that Howard Leight SmartFits and the E-A-R Push-Ins were more comfortable and easier to use than the Sonomax HPDs (p-value &lt;0.0001). We found a definite difference between manufacturers' attenuation data and our attenuation data, especially in the frequencies for 125-1000 Hz. Also, there was no difference in frequency and overall attenuation among the HPDs. This resulted in no difference in communication abilities among the types of HPDs."

They were divided in two age-matched groups and with tonal audiometric values within the acceptable limits: 37 were exposed to occupational noise and 37 were not exposed.RESULTS: Risk estimates (Odds Ratio) of absent DPOAE was 12 fold higher for the group exposed to occupational noise (CI 95% 3.1-45.9), in the frequencies of 3. 4 and 6 kHz.CONCLUSION: DPOAE may be useful in the identification of physiopathological hearing alterations caused by exposure to occupational noise, even in individuals with tonal audiometric responses within acceptable limits."
"17101101","[Effects of noise on inner ear].","The effects of noise on health depend both on individual factors and characteristics of sound exposure. In case of acoustic trauma, reversible or irreversible lesions of inner ear components are possible. Most often there is immediately an acute tinnitus and hearing loss. Audiometric tests demonstrate hearing loss on the high frequency, generally focused on 4 kHz. Immediate treatment is recommended even there is no currently indicator of the ability to restore hearing. New perspectives on treatment are directed to local treatment and/or using new procedure as antioxidative treatment. Occupational and leisure are the two conditions in which chronic exposure to noise is found. Detection and prevention of noise-induced hearing loss is easier in case of industrial workers than in case of noise exposition for musicians and other sounds and stage technicians or concert managers, and of course non-professional with exposure to amplified music."

This study tested whether objective notch metrics could match the clinical judgments of an expert panel.DESIGN: A panel of occupational physicians, otolaryngologists, and audiologists reviewed audiograms of noise-exposed workers. In a two-sample process, the panel judged whether a notch was present and whether hearing loss had progressed in a notch pattern. Quantitative notch metrics were compared against expert decisions.RESULTS: At least five of six experts agreed about notch identification in 71 and 72% of the cases in the two samples, and agreement about notch progression was 61 and 67%. Notch depth and professional specialty appeared to affect notch judgments. Despite this variability, a notch metric showed excellent agreement with expert notch consensus in each sample (94.7 and 96.6%; kappa = 0.88 and 0.92).CONCLUSIONS: Audiogram notch metrics can agree with expert clinical consensus and assist in the surveillance of noise-exposed workers."
"17085919","A study on compliance to hearing conservation programme among industries in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia.","Noise is one of the hazards faced by workers. A cross-sectional study was conducted among industries in Negeri Sembilan with the objective to assess their compliance to Hearing Conservation Programme (HCP). The other objectives of this study were to determine the factors influencing it and to show the industries' compliance to each element of the programme. It was also to identify the association between compliance to HCP and the prevalence of hearing impairment and standard threshold shift. Data for this study were collected using questionnaires sent by mail and also the results of the latest audiometric tests. A total of 167 industries were analysed for this study. It was found that 41.3% of these industries fully complied to the programme. It was also found that the industries preferred to provide hearing protection device (92.8%) and least complied to noise control (61.1%). There were significant associations (p&lt;0.05) between compliance and number of employees, status of ownership and the presence of officer in charge of hearing conservation programme. Having at least 150 employees actually raised the compliance to HCP in two folds (beta = 0.717, OR = 2.048, C.I 95% = 1.063 to 3.944). The prevalences of hearing impairment and standard threshold shift were 23.9% and 5.2% respectively. There was no significant association between the prevalence for hearing impairment and compliance to HCP. The prevalence for standard threshold shift was inversely related to compliance. This study showed that compliance percentage need to be improved as an effort to prevent the hearing problems among workers exposed to noise."
"17050312","Assessment of central auditory processing in a group of workers exposed to solvents.","CONCLUSION: Despite having normal hearing thresholds and speech recognition thresholds, results for central auditory tests were abnormal in a group of workers exposed to solvents. Workers exposed to solvents may have difficulties in everyday listening situations that are not related to a decrement in hearing thresholds. A central auditory processing disorder may underlie these difficulties.OBJECTIVE: To study central auditory processing abilities in a group of workers occupationally exposed to a mix of organic solvents.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten workers exposed to a mix of organic solvents and 10 matched non-exposed workers were studied. The test battery comprised pure-tone audiometry, tympanometry, acoustic reflex measurement, acoustic reflex decay, dichotic digit, pitch pattern sequence, masking level difference, filtered speech, random gap detection and hearing-in-noise tests.RESULTS: All the workers presented normal hearing thresholds and no signs of middle ear abnormalities. Workers exposed to solvents had lower results in comparison with the control group and previously reported normative data, in the majority of the tests."
"17009596","Association of hsp70 polymorphisms with risk of noise-induced hearing loss in Chinese automobile workers.","Severe noise exposure can induce heat shock proteins (Hsps), and exposure to moderate noise has been reported to confer protection against noise-induced damage to hearing. Whether there is any association of genetic variation in both constitutive and inducible hsp70 genes with noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is presently unknown. Using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism, we genotyped 3 polymorphisms (+190A/ B, +1267A/B, and +2437A/B) in the hsp70-1 (rs1043618), hsp70-2 (rs1061581), and hsp70-hom (rs2227956) genes, respectively, and investigated the associations of these polymorphisms with risk of developing NIHL in 194 automobile workers working in a similar noise environment as evaluated by audiological assessment. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the associations with the risk genotypes, and Whap software was used to analyze their haplotypes. Our results showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the genotype and allele distributions of hsp70-1, hsp70-2, and hsp70-hom between the NIHL group and the normal group (P &gt; 0.05) with and without adjustment for age, sex, smoking, history of explosive noise exposure, and cumulative noise exposure. However, haplotype analysis revealed that the Hap5 (ie, haplotype +190A/+1267B/+2437A) and Hap6 (ie, haplotype +190A/+1267B/+2437B) were significantly more frequent in the NIHL group than in the normal group (20/9, P = 0.022, and 7/0, P = 0.005, respectively). Compared with Hap1 (ie, +190A/+1267A/+2437A), Hap5 was associated with a nearly 3-fold increased risk of NIHL (adjusted odds ratio, 2.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-6.27). Seven of the NIHL patients had Hap6, but none of the controls had this haplotype. Our results suggest that some haplotypes of the hsp70 genes may be associated with a higher susceptibility to NIHL."

"16962270","Course of hearing loss and occurrence of tinnitus.","Chronic tinnitus is often accompanied by a hearing impairment, but it is still unknown whether hearing loss can actually cause tinnitus. The association between the pitch of the tinnitus sensation and the audiogram edge in patients with high-frequency hearing loss suggests a functional relation, but a large fraction of patients with hearing loss does not present symptoms of tinnitus. We therefore, investigated how the occurrence of tinnitus is related to the shape of the audiogram. We analyzed a sample where all patients had noise-induced hearing loss, containing 30 patients without tinnitus, 24 patients with tone-like tinnitus, and 17 patients with noise-like tinnitus. All patients had moderate to severe high-frequency hearing loss, and only minor to moderate hearing loss at low frequencies. We found that tinnitus patients had less overall hearing loss than patients without tinnitus. Moreover, the maximum steepness of the audiogram was higher in patients with tinnitus (-52.9+/-1.9 dB/octave) compared to patients without tinnitus (-43.1+/-2.4 dB/octave). Differences in overall hearing loss and maximum steepness between tone-like and noise-like tinnitus were not significant. For tone-like tinnitus, there was a clear association between the tinnitus pitch and the edge of the audiogram, with tinnitus pitch being on average 1.48+/-0.12 octaves above the audiogram edge frequency, and 0.81+/-0.1 octaves above the frequency with the steepest slope. Our results suggest that the occurrence of tinnitus is promoted by a steep audiogram slope. A steep slope leads to abrupt discontinuities in the activity along the tonotopic axis of the auditory system, which could be misinterpreted as sound."
"16957502","Methodological issues when comparing hearing thresholds of a group with population standards: the case of the ferry engineers.","OBJECTIVES: To discuss appropriate and inappropriate methods for comparing distributions of hearing thresholds of a study group with distributions in population standards and to determine whether the thresholds of Washington State Ferries engineers are different from those of men in the general population, using both frequency-by-frequency comparisons and analysis of audiometric shape.DESIGN: The most recent hearing conservation program audiograms of 321 noise-exposed engineers, ages 35 to 64, were compared with the predictions of Annexes A, B, and C from ANSI S3.44. There was no screening by history or otoscopy; all audiograms were included. 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for the engineers' median thresholds for each ear, for the better ear (defined two ways), and for the binaural average. For Annex B, where 95% CIs are also available, it was possible to calculate z scores for the differences between Annex B and the engineers' better ears. Bulge depth, an audiometric shape statistic, measured curvature between 1 and 6 kHz.RESULTS: Engineers' better-ear median thresholds were worse than those in Annex A but (except at 1 kHz) were as good as or better than those in Annexes B and C, which are more appropriate for comparison to an unscreened noise-exposed group like the engineers. Average bulge depth for the engineers was similar to that of the Annex B standard (no added occupational noise) and was much less than that of audiograms created by using the standard with added occupational noise between 90 and 100 dBA.CONCLUSIONS: Audiograms from groups that have been selected for a particular exposure, but, without regard to severity, can appropriately be compared with population standards, if certain pitfalls are avoided. For unscreened study groups with large age-sex subgroups, a simple method to assess statistical significance, taking into consideration uncertainties in both the study group and the comparison standard, is the calculation of z scores for the proportion of better-ear thresholds above the Annex B median. A less powerful method combines small age-sex subgroups after age correction. Small threshold differences, even if statistically significant, may not be due to genuine differences in hearing sensitivity between study group and standard. Audiometric shape analysis offers an independent dimension of comparison between the study group and audiograms predicted from the ANSI S3.44 standard, with and without occupational noise exposure. Important pitfalls in comparison to population standards include nonrandom selection of study groups, inappropriate choice of population standard, use of the right and left ear thresholds instead of the better-ear threshold for comparison to Annex B, and comparing means with medians. The thresholds of the engineers in this study were similar to published standards for an unscreened population."
"16938968","Auralization study of optimum reverberation times for speech intelligibility for normal and hearing-impaired listeners in classrooms with diffuse sound fields.","Speech-intelligibility tests auralized in a virtual classroom were used to investigate the optimal reverberation times for verbal communication for normal-hearing and hearing-impaired adults. The idealized classroom had simple geometry, uniform surface absorption, and an approximately diffuse sound field. It contained a speech source, a listener at a receiver position, and a noise source located at one of two positions. The relative output levels of the speech and noise sources were varied, along with the surface absorption and the corresponding reverberation time. The binaural impulse responses of the speech and noise sources in each classroom configuration were convolved with Modified Rhyme Test (MRT) and babble-noise signals. The resulting signals were presented to normal-hearing and hearing-impaired adult subjects to identify the configurations that gave the highest speech intelligibilities for the two groups. For both subject groups, when the speech source was closer to the listener than the noise source, the optimal reverberation time was zero. When the noise source was closer to the listener than the speech source, the optimal reverberation time included both zero and nonzero values. The results generally support previous theoretical results."
"16903348","[Evaluation of the risk on hearing loss at soldiers].","INTRODUCTION: Noise produced by weapons may be harmful to soldiers during military service. Exposure to impulse noise during compulsory military service depends on the number of shots, explosion impulses, distance of injured ear from causal firearm as well as on the use of hearing protectors. Weapons produce impulse noises, which are characterized by peak pressure level and frequency. The purpose of this work was to calculate and estimate risk on hearing at soldiers during one year of the military service.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comparised three groups of soldiers with different kind of exposure to noise divided according total noise exposure. In order to evaluate the amount of the exposure to impulse noise the total level of noise and the spectrum analysis were performed for all types of weapons, which were used during military service. The equivalent continuous A-weighted sound pressure level, L A eq, Te [dB], maximum A-weighted sound pressure level, L A max [dB] and C weighted peak sound pressure level, L C peak [dB] were measured.RESULTS: The highest total exposure to noise concerned group I (2222,9 kPa(2)/s for right ear and 22212,8 kPa(2)/s for left one) with total exposure time 248,3 minutes. In the II group estimated total exposure to noise was 611,8 kPa(2)/s for right ear and 743,6 kPa(2)/s for left one. In the III group least exposed to noise, estimated total exposure to noise was 103 kPa(2)/s for right ear and 109 kPa(2)/s for left one with total time exposure 17,8 minutes.CONCLUSIONS: Difference between groups is dependent on kind of military service. Estimated exposure to weapons noise may prevent soldiers before hearing loss. We did not notice differences between sites of ears."
"16903347","[Distortion product otoacoustic emissions before and after one year exposure to impulse noise].","INTRODUCTION: Firearms are a common source of impulse noise that may be very harmful to the auditory organ. Impulse noise from weapons and explosions continually produces hearing damage among military personnel. The discovery of otoacoustic emission (OAE) has given a new possibility of early diagnosis of noise induced hearing loss. The transiently evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) are non-invasive, objective and frequency specific audiometric tests for evaluating outer hair cell function. The aim of the study was to asses the effects of exposure to impulse noise on DPOAE after one year of the obligatory military service.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprised 92 (184 ears) soldiers, subjected to impulse noise during military service. The examine group was divided according total noise exposure. The control group consisted of secondary school students not exposed to noise. DPOAE was recorded before and after one year of military service.RESULTS: After military service significant deterioration of DPOAE level was observed at frequencies of 1, 3, and 4 kHz on the right ear and 2, 5 and 6 kHz left one.CONCLUSIONS: 1. Reduction of DPOAE amplitude connected all frequencies. 2. We did not notice significant differences between groups connected total noise exposure."

A cross-sectional study was conducted that included sonometry tests, carried out according to the established methodology by COVENIN rules, and the occupational medical evaluation and liminal tonal audiometrics test in 75 workers. The equivalent noise levels (Leq) was quantified in different workplaces. It was found out that most of the workers are exposed to high noise levels [&gt;85 dB(A)] and during more time than the recommended. All workers use hearing protectors appropriately. The hearing loss prevalence in workers was 16.0%, there were not noise-induced hearing losses. The hearing threshold registered in the audiometrics test was diminished, but inside the normal threshold values. We diagnosed 12 cases of conductive hearing loss, all grade I; there were not sensorial or mixed hearing losses. There was not a relationship between the equivalent noise level and hearing loss. It is suggested the design and implantation of a program of auditory conservation to protect the health and security of the workers and to conduct a longitudinal study considering the findings of the present study as it basis."
"16882540","Hearing loss in workers exposed to toluene and noise.","In this study we investigated the risk of hearing loss among workers exposed to both toluene and noise. We recruited 58 workers at an adhesive materials manufacturing plant who were exposured to both toluene and noise [78.6-87.1 A-weighted decibels; dB(A)], 58 workers exposed to noise only [83.5-90.1 dB(A)], and 58 administrative clerks [67.9-72.6 dB(A)] at the same company. We interviewed participants to obtain sociodemographic and employment information and performed physical examinations, including pure-tone audiometry tests between 0.5 and 6 kHz. A contracted laboratory certified by the Council of Labor in Taiwan conducted on-site toluene and noise exposure measurements. The prevalence of hearing loss of &gt;or=25 dB in the toluene plus noise group (86.2%) was much greater than that in the noise-only group (44.8%) and the administrative clerks (5.0%) (p&lt;0.001). The prevalence rates were 67.2, 32.8, and 8.3% (p&lt;0.001), respectively, when 0.5 kHz was excluded from the estimation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the toluene plus noise group had an estimated risk for hearing loss&gt;or=25 dB, 10.9 times higher than that of the noise-only group. The risk ratio dropped to 5.8 when 0.5 kHz was excluded from the risk estimation. Hearing impairment was greater for the pure-tone frequency of 1 kHz than for that of 2 kHz. However, the mean hearing threshold was the poorest for 6 kHz, and the least effect was observed for 2 kHz. Our results suggest that toluene exacerbates hearing loss in a noisy environment, with the main impact on the lower frequencies."
"16875225","Low-level otoacoustic emissions may predict susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss.","In a longitudinal study with 338 volunteers, audiometric thresholds and otoacoustic emissions were measured before and after 6 months of noise exposure on an aircraft carrier. While the average amplitudes of the otoacoustic emissions decreased significantly, the average audiometric thresholds did not change. Furthermore, there were no significant correlations between changes in audiometric thresholds and changes in otoacoustic emissions. Changes in transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions were moderately correlated. Eighteen ears acquired permanent audiometric threshold shifts. Only one-third of those ears showed significant otoacoustic emission shifts that mirrored their permanent threshold shifts. A Bayesian analysis indicated that permanent threshold shift status following a deployment was predicted by baseline low-level or absent otoacoustic emissions. The best predictor was transient-evoked otoacoustic emission amplitude in the 4-kHz half-octave frequency band, with risk increasing more than sixfold from approximately 3% to 20% as the emission amplitude decreased. It is possible that the otoacoustic emissions indicated noise-induced changes in the inner ear, undetected by audiometric tests. Otoacoustic emissions may therefore be a diagnostic predictor for noise-induced-hearing-loss risk."
"16850905","Hypertension and hearing impairment in workers of iron and steel industry.","The objectives of the present study were to study the (i) prevalence of hypertension and hearing impairment in iron and steel industry workers, (ii) association between hypertension and hearing impairment, (iii) association between hypertension and hearing impairment, with duration of exposure, and (iv) correlation between levels of sound and noise induced health problems viz. hypertension and hearing impairment in a cross sectional study involving Workers working in iron and steel industry at Nagpur. Of a total of 804 workers, 770 workers participated in the study. There were five sections in the factory; Steel melting section (SMS), rolling mill section (RMS), quality control department (QCD), maintenance department (MD) and administration department (AD). Workers working in SMS, RMS, &amp; QCD formed a continuously exposed group (CEG); workers of MD and AD formed intermittently exposed group (IEG). Workers were interviewed, examined and information was collected in a pre-tested pro-forma. Blood pressure was measured, and tuning fork tests were done to assess hearing ability. Prevalence of hypertension among CEG (25.51%) was significantly higher than IEG (14.05%). (X2-14.28, df-1, P&lt;0.001). There was positive association between duration of exposure and prevalence of hypertension. The prevalence of hearing impairment was significantly more in CEG (20.5%) as compared to IEG (8.91%). (X2-11.69, df-1, P&lt;0.001). Occurrence of hearing impairment was also directly proportional to the duration of exposure. The correlation between level of sound exposure and hearing impairment was found to be significant (r=0.98; P&lt;0.05), the correlation between level of sound and hypertension was found to be statistically insignificant (r=0.84; P&gt;0.05). The results of the present study indicate that hypertension and hearing impairment are commoner in workers continuously exposed to high levels of occupational noise."
"16825883","Hearing in nonprofessional pop/rock musicians.","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hearing and subjective auditory symptoms in a group of nonprofessional pop/rock musicians who had experienced repeated exposures to intense sound levels during at least 5 yr of musical activity.DESIGN: An evaluation of both ears in 42 nonprofessional pop/rock musicians included pure-tone audiometry in the conventional and extended high-frequency range, the measurement of uncomfortable loudness levels, and an assessment of tinnitus and hypersensitivity to sound. Exclusion criteria were (a) the occurrence of acoustic trauma, (b) excessive noise exposure during occupational activities, (c) a history of recurrent otitis media, (d) previous ear surgery, (e) a fracture of the cranium, (f) ingestion of potentially ototoxic drugs, and (g) reported hearing difficulties within the immediate family. These audiometric results were then compared with a control group of 20 otologically normal young adults with no history of long-term noise exposure.RESULTS: After adjusting for age and gender, relative to ISO 7029, the mean hearing threshold in the frequency range of 3 to 8 kHz was 6 dB in the musicians and 1.5 dB in the control group. This difference was statistically significant (Mann-Whitney rank sum test, p &lt; 0.001). A significant difference was also observed between musicians using regular hearing protection during their activities (average 3 to 8 kHz thresholds = 2.4 dB) and musicians who never used such hearing protection (average 3 to 8 kHz thresholds = 8.2 dB), after adjusting for age and gender (Mann-Whitney rank sum test, p = 0.006). Eleven of the musicians (26%) were found to be hypersensitive to sound, and seven (17%) presented with tinnitus. Tinnitus assessment, however, did not reveal any clinically significant psychological distress in these individuals.CONCLUSIONS: Tinnitus and hypersensitivity to sound were observed in a significant minority within a group of nonprofessional pop/rock musicians who had experienced repeated exposure to intense sound levels over at least 5 yr but with minimal impact on their lives. Moreover, hearing loss was minimal in the subjects who always used ear protection, being only 0.9 dB higher than the control group. In contrast, hearing loss was significantly more pronounced, at 6.7 dB higher than the control group, in those musicians who never used ear protection. Continued education about the risk to hearing and the benefits of the persistent use of ear protection is warranted for musicians who are exposed frequently to intense sound levels."

"16782739","Variability of real-world hearing protector attenuation measurements.","The attenuation provided by a hearing protection device (HPD) in the field is usually estimated by applying a derating factor to the laboratory-determined noise reduction rating (NRR) of the HPD. However, attenuation is highly dependent on individual-specific HPD fit. Prediction of an individual's attenuation depends on the accuracy of the measurement system and the variability of attenuation over time (e.g. after HPD refitting). Variability in attenuation and attenuation test systems has not been adequately characterized to allow for such an assessment. This study compared attenuation measurements made with two systems, Real-Ear-at-Threshold (REAT) and Microphone-in-Real-Ear (MIRE), on 20 workers using two earplugs (foam and custom-molded). Workers' perceptions of the earplugs were also evaluated. Individuals' attenuation results were summarized as personal attenuation ratings (PARs, similar to NRRs). Variability in PARs from between-subject, within-subject and within-day (i.e. repeated tests on a subject without earplug refitting) differences was assessed and used to present the lower confidence limit, or uncertainty factor (UF), of an average individual's attenuation. The custom-molded earplug PARs achieved a higher mean percentage of labeled attenuation than did the foam earplug with both test systems. The custom-molded earplugs also had higher overall acceptance among workers. MIRE PAR levels were lower than REAT levels for both earplugs, but the relationship between the two test systems was highly variable. The MIRE system had lower within-day variability than the REAT system. One individual's MIRE results were highly influential; removal of these results greatly reduced the UF for the custom-molded earplug/MIRE combination. UFs ranged from 8.8 to 13.5 dB. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating variability in individual-specific protection results for personal protective equipment like HPDs, rather than relying on single measurements."

Average hearing loss, across both ears and the frequencies 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz, was calculated from the last audiogram for each man. Previous noise exposure at work was assessed retrospectively by three hygienists using work histories, noise survey records from 1965-98, and judgement about use of hearing protection devices. Smoking and age at the time of the audiogram were extracted from records. Differences in hearing loss between men categorised by cumulative noise exposure were assessed after controlling for age, smoking, year of test, and previous test experience.RESULTS: There were 186 and 150 eligible subjects at sites A and B of the company respectively who were employed for an average of 20 years. Compared to men with less than one year's exposure to levels of 85dB(A) or greater, hearing loss was greater by 3.7 dB (90% CI -2.6 to 10.1), 3.8 dB (90% CI -2.6 to 10.3), 7.0 dB (90% CI 1.1 to 12.9) and 10.1 dB (90% CI 4.2 to 16.0) in the lowest to highest categories of cumulative noise exposure at site B. In contrast, at site A, the corresponding figures were -2.2 dB, -2.4 dB, -1.8 dB, and -4.4 dB, with no confidence interval excluding zero.CONCLUSIONS: Noise estimation at one site was shown to have predictive validity in terms of hearing loss, but not at the other site. Reasons for the differences between sites are discussed."

Pure-tone audiometry was administered to an adult general population sample with 51 975 subjects who also provided questionnaire information about noise exposure and other risk factors. Threshold shifts induced by life-long occupational noise and impulse noise (mostly shooting) were estimated separately in six age and sex groups for eight frequencies. Reported noise exposure, as well as observed threshold shifts, were moderate among women. Threshold shifts averaged over both ears among subjects in the higher 2% of exposure to occupational noise, reached 13 dB (3000 Hz, age 65 years + ) among men and were generally largest at 3000-4000 Hz. The shifts induced by impulse noise reached approximately 8 dB among men 45-64 years and men 65 years+. The effects of impulse noise were strongest at 3000-8000 Hz and varied little within this frequency range."
"16716004","Field study to explore possible effects of styrene on auditory function in exposed workers.","OBJECTIVES: We conducted this study to examine, whether occupational styrene exposures are associated with reduced hearing ability.METHODS: The auditory function was investigated by pure tone audiometry and registration of transitory evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) in 32 workers of a fibre-reinforced plastic boat building factory. Sixteen subjects were laminators (mean age: 41 yr (SD: 8)) and therefore regularly exposed to styrene with mean duration of exposure to styrene of 7.5 yr (SD 5.0). The tests were applied to a reference group of 16 workers (mean age: 39 yr (SD: 8)) who were not directly exposed to styrene but had a similar noise exposure.RESULTS: A few and isolated correlations between the parameters of hearing acuity and exposure indices, such as current internal styrene exposures (sum of MA and PGA) and duration of styrene exposure, were statistically significant, but no consistent association was found.CONCLUSION: The results of this study do not support the assumption of an ototoxic effect of chronic styrene exposure in workers."

"16704911","Occupational exposure to noise, and hearing function among electro production workers.","OBJECTIVE: The present study has the aim to investigate the prevalence and the determinants of hearing loss among electro production workers.METHODS: Ninety-three electro production workers and 51 office workers underwent audiometric test. Information regarding, socio-demographics, present and past medical history of hearing problems, use of ototoxic drugs, hobbies, and smoking habit was obtained using a self administered questionnaire.RESULTS: The levels of noise at workplace have also been measured. Electro production workers were exposed to high levels of noise. Statistical analysis has shown that 44% of electro production workers had sensorineural hearing loss located mainly at 4000 Hz. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that occupational exposure to noise appears to be the strongest predictor (odds ratio, OR: 7.51) of NIHL followed by aging (OR: 5.34), and last by smoking (OR: 2.47).CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that electro production workers are occupationally exposed to high levels of noise, and present high rates of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The observed hearing loss was located mainly at 4000 Hz. These findings underline the need for interventions to reduce the risk for the development of NIHL among electro production workers."
"16702119","Hearing loss in migrant agricultural workers.","BACKGROUND: Farmers have high rates of hearing loss, yet little is known about the hearing status of migrant agricultural workers. We performed a cross-sectional survey to assess the prevalence and impact of hearing loss in this population.METHODS: One hundred fifty migrant and seasonal agricultural workers were surveyed at a series of health fairs held at migrant camps. A bilingual questionnaire included items related to hearing loss risk factors and subjective hearing difficulties. Pure tone audiometry and tympanometry were performed in a mobile testing van.RESULTS: More than half the subjects had some degree of hearing loss at audiometric frequencies between 500 and 6,000 Hz, especially in the higher frequencies. Hispanic males in the sample had significantly greater prevalence of high-frequency hearing loss compared to adults in the national Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES). More than 35% of respondents complained of subjective difficulty hearing or understanding speech, yet no workers reported use of hearing aids. Even after adjusting for measured hearing loss, Hispanic farm workers were more likely than their English- speaking counterparts to complain of difficulty hearing or understanding speech, suggesting that language barriers could worsen the impact of hearing loss. Risk factors for hearing loss included age and abnormal tympanometry. Occupational exposures to noise from tractors and other machinery as well as pesticides were frequently reported, while use of hearing protection was rare.CONCLUSION: Hearing loss is a significant and under-recognized problem in the migrant worker population. Further preventive and treatment efforts are warranted."
"16684706","A study of hearing changes among military conscripts in the Swedish Army.","The aim of the study was to investigate the incidence and the relative risk of significant threshold shift (STS, &gt;or=15 dB deterioration at any ear and audiometric frequency) during primary military service (7-9 months), and to investigate whether subjects with an initial slight hearing loss (thresholds&gt;or=25 dB HL at any audiometric frequency and ear) were under increased risk. The investigation was made as a prospective audiometric study and included 747 men. An age-matched group of 138 individuals served as an unexposed control group, whose incidence of STS was 2.9%. In the exposed group the incidence was 7.9% and the relative risk 2.7 risk ratio (RR). In the subgroup of 95 persons, who already at reporting-for-training had a mild hearing loss, the incidence was 17%. The relative risk for STS in this group compared to the control group was 6.8 (RR), and compared to those with normal hearing at reporting was 3.1 (RR). In spite of hearing conservation efforts, hearing deterioration still occurs, above all in the artillery. Those who already at reporting-for-training had a mild hearing loss were at higher risk for STS compared to those with initially normal hearing."
"16680467","Occupational noise exposure and sensorineural hearing loss among workers of a steel rolling mill.","Hearing loss is one of the most common chronic health conditions and has important implications for the patient's quality of life. However, hearing loss is substantially underestimated and under treated. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of sensorineural hearing loss among the workers in a steel rolling mill in Nigeria. Each of the 150 randomly selected subjects had a structured questionnaire administered to them, followed by a full otological examination. Of these, 116 had tympanometry and pure-tone audiometry. Also a noise mapping of their respective work units was done. The workers were exposed to noise levels varying from 49 to 93 dBA. About 28.2% of the 103 who had their audiogram analysed had mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss in their better ear and 56.8% of them had mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss in their worse ear. The pure-tone average and the average hearing thresholds at 4 kHz for the groups significantly increased with an increasing noise exposure level. The prevalence of sensorineural hearing loss among the study population is high; and noise exposure is at least contributory. Pre-employment and regular audiometry while on the job is highly recommended."

Measurement is necessary whenever the auditory system function is being measured using the auditory brainstem response (ABR) or distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) or is being challenged by a noise exposure. While the theory of measuring an acoustic signal with a calibrated measuring microphone is simple, in practice, it can become complex. The present article presents guidelines for measuring acoustic stimuli which is within the abilities of a well equipped laboratory. It also presents a set of links for further information and some sources for procurement of equipment."
"16625866","[Comparative study between the level of discomfort and the acoustic reflex in workers].","BACKGROUND: Comparative study between the level of discomfort and the acoustic reflex in workers.AIM: To observe the hearing behavior, through the assessment of the contraction activity of the stapedius muscle and the level of discomfort, of individuals who are and are not exposed to occupational noise, with the aim of identifying the influence of noise in the behavior of the contraction of the stapedius muscle and in the sensibility of hearing.METHOD: This study was developed at the Serviço Social da Indústria - SESI - Ce. A hundred and three adults with normal hearing, male and female, with ages varying from 18 to 45 years were divided in three groups: G1 with 41 adults exposed to noise and who used AIPE; G2 with 32 adults exposed to noise and who did not use AIPE; G3 with 30 adults who were not exposed to noise. Participants were submitted to audiologic evaluation, including the analysis of the acoustic reflex level (ARL) and discomfort level (DL) at the frequencies of 500 HZ, 1000Hz, 2000Hz, 3000Hz, 4000Hz and WN. For the statistical analysis the tests of Mann Whitney, Wilcoxon and Kruskal, with significance levels of 5%, were used.RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was identified for the ARL between the three groups, with mean values ranging from 93 to 103dBHL; the ARL was significantly smaller than the DL, with the mean values of DL varying from 111 to 119 dBHL for G1, from 113 to 120dBHL for G2 and from 106 to 114dBHL for G3; the DL is higher in individuals of G1 followed by individuals of G2 and G3.CONCLUSION: The exposure to noise does not determine changes in the behavior of the ARL; the DL rises with the exposure to occupational noise; the DL is higher than the ARL in 10 to 25dB."
"16583105","[Program for hearing loss prevention in four metallurgical factories in Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil].","This study analyzes noise control programs in four metallurgical factories in Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil. From 1997 to 2001, 741 workers were examined and the programs were analyzed based on workers' profiles (2,270 audiometric exams) and documents on hearing preservation programs. 41% of workers presented hearing loss (mean age 42.3; mean years of work 16.7). 104 workers with more than one audiometric exam presented changes in hearing threshold. 36.5% (38 workers) developed noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and 63.5% (66 workers) with existing NIHL showed worsening of their hearing threshold. In these factories, 69.5% of workers were exposed to &gt; or = 84dB(A). We concluded that the hearing preservation programs are not adequately organized and that workers are still exposed to high noise levels at work, posing a risk for NIHL. In addition, the current legislation on hearing loss prevention is not enforced."
"16578979","A comparison of the military entrance processing station screening audiogram with the Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System reference audiogram at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, in 2000.","BACKGROUND: The Department of Defense Hearing Conservation Program requires that a reference audiogram be performed at initial entry training (IET), before noise exposure. In the Army, only Fort Sill, home of the field artillery, and Fort Benning, home of the infantry, are in compliance. All military applicants receive a screening audiogram at a military entrance processing station (MEPS) to qualify for service. This audiogram does not meet the Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System-Hearing Conservation (DOEHRS-HC) standard. Nevertheless, it has been proposed that the MEPS screen be used as the reference because of limited resources and time during IET medical in-processing.METHODS: A total of 11,816 individual reference audiograms performed at Fort Sill 95th Adjutant General Recruit Reception Center in 2000 were identified in the DOEHRS-HC database. Results of the MEPS screening audiograms were found for 11,311 (96%) of these individuals. The two audiograms were compared by frequency and ear and by using the two Department of Defense criteria for threshold shift.RESULTS: A total of 14.49% (95% confidence interval, 14.48-14.50%) of audiograms using the three-frequency average difference and 23.19% (95% confidence interval, 23.18-23.20%) using the four-frequency difference in either ear demonstrated a threshold shift. The mean difference in intensity between the two audiograms ranged from 5 to 12 dB and varied by frequency and ear, with the greatest differences being seen at 500 and 6,000 kHz and in the left ear, compared with the right ear. The mean threshold level was higher for each frequency in the DOEHRS-HC audiogram, compared with the MEPS audiogram.CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 15% of soldiers at Fort Sill in 2000 showed a clinically significant threshold difference between their MEPS screening and the DOEHRS-HC baseline audiogram. Methodological variations in testing and interval noise-induced hearing loss could account for these differences. The results do not support the use of the MEPS screening audiogram as the reference audiogram. Compliance with the Hearing Conservation Program in the Army would require either improving MEPS testing to DOEHRS-HC standards or performing baseline audiograms at all five IET sites."

All of the conscripts underwent hearing screening. The conscripts' time in noisy activities and their rating of the loudness and estimated noise levels of the activities were used as the predictors in the risk analysis. Self-reported hearing symptoms (i.e., tinnitus, pain in the ear) and hearing loss due to noise exposure were also inquired about. Twenty-seven percent of the conscripts had weekly noise exposure to &gt; 85 dBA. Approximately 20% of the conscripts had &gt;20 dB hearing loss in either ear in the frequency range of 0.5 to 8 kHz. The incidence of hearing symptoms seemed to correlate with an increased noise dose."
"16551755","Noise exposure and hearing loss prevention programmes after 20 years of regulations in the United States.","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate noise exposures and hearing loss prevention efforts in industries with relatively high rates of workers' compensation claims for hearing loss.METHODS: Washington State workers' compensation records were used to identify up to 10 companies in each of eight industries. Each company (n = 76) was evaluated by a management interview, employee personal noise dosimetry (n = 983), and employee interviews (n = 1557).RESULTS: Full-shift average exposures were &gt; or =85 dBA for 50% of monitored employees, using Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) parameters with a 5 dB exchange rate (L(ave)), but 74% were &gt; or =85 dBA using a 3 dB exchange rate (L(eq)). Only 14% had L(ave) &gt; or =90 dBA, but 42% had L(eq) &gt; or =90 dBA. Most companies conducted noise measurements, but most kept no records, and consideration of noise controls was low in all industries. Hearing loss prevention programmes were commonly incomplete. Management interview scores (higher score = more complete programme) showed significant associations with percentage of employees having L(ave) &gt; or =85 dBA and presence of a union (multiple linear regression; R2 = 0.24). Overall, 62% of interviewed employees reported always using hearing protection when exposed. Protector use showed significant associations with percentage of employees specifically required to use protection, management score, and average employee time spent &gt; or =95 dBA (R2 = 0.65).CONCLUSIONS: The findings raise serious concerns about the adequacy of prevention, regulation, and enforcement strategies in the United States. The percentage of workers with excessive exposure was 1.5-3 times higher using a 3 dB exchange rate instead of the OSHA specified 5 dB exchange rate. Most companies gave limited or no attention to noise controls and relied primarily on hearing protection to prevent hearing loss; yet 38% of employees did not use protectors routinely. Protector use was highest when hearing loss prevention programmes were most complete, indicating that under-use of protection was, in some substantial part, attributable to incomplete or inadequate company efforts."
"16521772","Experimental comparison between speech transmission index, rapid speech transmission index, and speech intelligibility index.","During the acoustical design of, e.g., auditoria or open-plan offices, it is important to know how speech can be perceived in various parts of the room. Different objective methods have been developed to measure and predict speech intelligibility, and these have been extensively used in various spaces. In this study, two such methods were compared, the speech transmission index (STI) and the speech intelligibility index (SII). Also the simplification of the STI, the room acoustics speech transmission index (RASTI), was considered. These quantities are all based on determining an apparent speech-to-noise ratio on selected frequency bands and summing them using a specific weighting. For comparison, some data were needed on the possible differences of these methods resulting from the calculation scheme and also measuring equipment. Their prediction accuracy was also of interest. Measurements were made in a laboratory having adjustable noise level and absorption, and in a real auditorium. It was found that the measurement equipment, especially the selection of the loudspeaker, can greatly affect the accuracy of the results. The prediction accuracy of the RASTI was found acceptable, if the input values for the prediction are accurately known, even though the studied space was not ideally diffuse."
"16470283","[Association between noise-induced hearing loss and tinnitus].","The objective of this study was to verify an association between noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and tinnitus in workers exposed to occupational noise. Workers with a history of work noise exposure who attended two audiology outpatient clinics were interviewed and evaluated. The statistical association between NIHL and tinnitus was evaluated using an adjusted linear regression model, with tinnitus as the dependent variable and NIHL, classified into six levels, as the independent variable, with age and length of noise exposure as covariates. Data were collected from 284 workers between April and October, 2003, in Bauru, São Paulo State, Brazil. Tinnitus was observed to increase with the progression of auditory damage, controlled by age and length of noise exposure. These results suggest that investment in hearing conservation programs is needed, especially for source noise emission control and for intervention in hearing loss progression that is caused by noise exposure, in order to maintain auditory health and reduce the associated symptoms."
"16422455","Hearing in military pilots: one-time audiometry in pilots of fighters, transports, and helicopters.","INTRODUCTION: Pilots are exposed to potentially harmful levels of noise, the actual consequences of which are still poorly documented. We have determined the audiometric profiles of pilots as a function of age and type of aircraft (i.e., fighter, transport, helicopter) and have searched for risk factors of deafness other than noise in a pilot population.METHODS: We examined 521 French military pilots ages 20-40 yr during their annual medical check-ups. Pilots were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire and data from tonal audiograms of both ears were collected. Hearing levels were compared between groups of age and aircraft category.RESULTS: Abnormal hearing levels in pilots were found essentially at high frequencies with a marked notch on audiograms at 6 kHz. Left ears had a significantly poorer performance compared with right ears. At a given age, transport pilots had, on average, better hearing at 8 kHz than other pilots, despite a higher number of flying hours. In addition to the 6 kHz notch, helicopter pilots showed a significant hearing loss at 3 kHz. Such an enlargement of the impaired frequency range can disturb speech communication. Prevalence of otitis media in childhood was significantly higher in pilots with abnormal hearing.DISCUSSION: Pilots flying fighter and helicopter aircraft are at a higher risk of hearing loss compared with pilots flying transport aircraft. Improvements in ear protection seem particularly needed for the left ear. Hearing losses can potentially compromise speech communication in helicopter pilots."
"16422454","Hearing thresholds for U.S. Marines: comparison of aviation, combat arms, and other personnel.","INTRODUCTION: Aviation personnel in the U.S. Marine Corps are exposed to auditory trauma that may produce hearing loss in excess of personnel with other work exposures.METHODS: U.S. Marine Corps personnel in the Navy and Marine Corps Hearing Conservation Database (1995-1999; n = 20,645) were analyzed. The outcome variable was a hearing threshold at 4000 Hz in the left ear greater than 25 dB for annual and periodic audiograms. Personnel were characterized by gender, officer status, 5-yr age groups, and by military occupational skills (MOS) groups of &quot;aviation,&quot; &quot;combat arms,&quot; and &quot;other.&quot;RESULTS: After adjustment by logistic regression for age group, gender, and officer status, the &quot;aviation&quot; group was not different from the &quot;other&quot; category, while the &quot;combat arms&quot; group was more likely to have elevated hearing thresholds. Officers and women demonstrated significantly lower rates for elevated thresholds.DISCUSSION: These findings provide information for personnel planning and assessing military hearing conservation programs."
"16418922","Influence of environmental factors on the evolution of industrial noise-induced hearing loss.","The aim of the study is to investigate how environmental factors, associated with exposure to industrial noise, affect the development of chronic noise-induced hearing loss. The study was conducted on 186 male subjects working in two bottling plants, situated respectively in a small farming community, and in a medium-sized city with significant levels of noise pollution. Levels of occupational exposure were the same for the two groups. The subjects were selected by means of a preliminary medical examination, and exposed to tonal hearing tests and acoustic impedance tests. Statistical analysis was performed on hearing threshold values obtained at the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz. The comparison between the thresholds obtained in the two groups showed a statistically significant difference, especially at the frequency of 4000 Hz and for occupational exposure exceeding 17 yr. The results led us to conclude that environmental factors, and urban noise in particular, influence the onset and development of occupational acoustic trauma, and that those working in the country are significantly less affected than those in the city. Since occupational exposure was the same for both groups, their different responses must therefore be interpreted as due to differences in non-occupational exposure, in turn dependent on different opportunities for rest from noise and different levels of exposure to noise pollution."
"16417702","The Nord-Trøndelag Norway Audiometric Survey 1996-98: unscreened thresholds and prevalence of hearing impairment for adults &gt; 20 years.","As supplement to a general health screening examination (HUNT-II), we conducted a puretone audiometry study in 1996-98 on adults (&gt;20 years) in 17 of 23 municipalities in Nord-Trøndelag, Norway, including questionnaires on occupational and leisure noise exposure, medical history, and symptoms of hearing impairment. The study aims to contribute to updated normative hearing thresholds for age and gender, while evaluating the effects of noise exposure, medical history, and familial or genetic influences on hearing. This paper presents the unscreened hearing threshold data and prevalence of hearing impairment for different age groups and by gender. Valid audiometric data were collected from 62% (n=50,723) of 82,141 unscreened invited subjects (age-range 20-101 years, mean=50.2 years, SD=17.0 years). Two ambulant audiometric teams each conducted 5 parallel self-administered, pure-tone hearing threshold examinations with the standard test frequencies 0.25-0.5-1-2-3-4-6-8 kHz (manual procedure when needed). Tracking audiometers were used in dismountable booths with in-booth noise levels well within ISO criteria, except being at the criterion around 200 Hz. The data were electronically transferred to a personal computer. Test-retest correlations for 99 randomly drawn subjects examined twice were high. The mean thresholds recorded were some dB elevated from &quot;audiometric zero&quot; even for age group 20-24 years. As also found in other studies, this might indicate too restrictive audiometric reference thresholds. Males had slightly better hearing &lt; or =0.5 kHz for all age groups. Mean thresholds were poorer in males &gt; or = 30 years from &gt; or =2 kHz, with maximal gender differences of approximately 20 dB at 3-4 kHz for subjects aged 55-74 years. Weighted prevalence data averaged over 0.5-1-2-4 kHz showed hearing impairment &gt;25 dB hearing threshold level of 18.8% (better ear) and 27.2% (worse ear) for the total population--for males 22.2% and 32.0%, for females 15.9% and 23.0%, respectively. Mean hearing loss &gt; or =10 dB at 6 kHz registered for both genders even in age groups 20-24 years may be partly due to calibration artefacts, but might possibly also reflect noise-related socio-acusis."

The purpose of this study was to compare the fit and predictive usefulness of the original and revised structures of the HPM as applied to the use of hearing protection devices by 703 construction workers. Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the two alternative forms of the model. Both forms of the model fit well, with the revised structure having a better fit and explaining more of the variance in use of hearing protection (28% vs. 18%). Results support the revised structure of the health promotion model (HPM) over the original form, and indicate it may be useful in understanding and predicting use of hearing protection."

They are continuously exposed to occupational aviation noise and therefore are at risk for chronic neurosensory hypoacusis. Pure tone audiogram registers in them a rise in hearing thresholds throughout the whole band of frequencies studied. This means that aviation maintenance staff is exposed to noise containing highly intensive infrasound and high-frequency components. The detected pathology directly correlated with duration of exposure to noise. Development of neurosensory hypoacusis in aviation maintenance specialists starts earlier than in other specialists exposed to noise."

To develop such methods, we studied parameters of evoked otoacoustic emission with reference to age of the drivers and duration of occupational exposure to noise. We established characteristics of delayed evoked otoacoustic emission and evoked distortion product otoacoustic emission. These parameters can be used in occupational selection and certification of transport drivers as markers of initial signs of a negative noise effect on the hearing organ."
"18082023","Theoretical predictions and actual hearing threshold levels in workers exposed to ultrasonic noise of impulsive character--a pilot study.","Results of standard pure-tone audiometry (PTA) were collected from 25 workers, mainly females, aged 23-58 years, exposed for 2-13 years to ultrasonic noise emitted by ultrasonic welders. Hearing tests were completed by evaluation of exposure to ultrasonic noise. The subjects' actual audiometric hearing threshold levels (HTLs) were compared with theoretical predictions calculated according to ISO 1999:1990. In 60% of cases sound pressure levels in the 10-40 kHz 1/3-octave bands at workstands exceeded Polish exposure limits for ultrasonic noise. Our comparison of predicted and measured HTLs suggests that the ISO 1999:1990 method, intended for audible noise, might also make it possible to predict reliably permanent hearing loss (in the 2000-6000 Hz frequency range) after exposure to ultrasonic noise. No significant progress of hearing impairment (assessed using PTA) in the operators of ultrasonic welders was noted. Nevertheless, further studies on the hearing status of workers exposed to ultrasonic noise are needed."
"18082021","Central auditory damage induced by solvent exposure.","Different studies have demonstrated that solvents may induce auditory damage. It has been suggested that part of this damage may be localised in central auditory pathways. The present study aimed to investigate possible auditory processing disorders related to solvent exposure. Thirty solvent-exposed workers and 30 gender-, age- and educational level-matched control subjects were selected to participate in the study. To select participants, a questionnaire, otoscopy, pure-tone audiometry and tympanometry were carried out. Filtered speech (FS), random gap detection (RGD) and hearing-in-noise tests (HINT) were conducted in the selected participants. Both groups of workers presented as a mean normal hearing thresholds. However, significant differences between groups were observed for RGD, FS and HINT. It is concluded that a possible auditory processing disorder may be related to solvent exposure."
"18055764","A multinomial model for identifying significant pure-tone threshold shifts.","PURPOSE: Significant threshold differences on retest for pure-tone audiometry are often evaluated by application of ad hoc rules, such as a shift in a pure-tone average or in 2 adjacent frequencies that exceeds a predefined amount. Rules that are so derived do not consider the probability of observing a particular audiogram.METHODS: A general solution for evaluating threshold differences on retest was developed on the basis of multinomial probabilities. The model uses the standard deviation of inter-test differences for 1 frequency as a parameter of the underlying Gaussian distribution of test results. The number of test frequencies, the categories of threshold change, and the probability of each category's occurrence are used to calculate the probability that a given pattern of threshold differences on retest (or 1 rarer) could occur by chance.RESULTS: The multinomial model was compared with 2 other methods for identifying threshold shifts in persons exposed to high sound pressure levels during concerts. The multinomial model identified the same audiograms as the ad hoc methods.CONCLUSION: Tables developed using a multinomial model can provide a clinical tool for evaluating audiograms by identifying statistically significant patterns of test-retest differences in hearing thresholds."
"18034257","Is the audiologic status of professional musicians a reflection of the noise exposure in classical orchestral music?","The sound in classical orchestral music is louder than noise emissions allowed by national rules in industry. We wanted to assess the audiologic status of professional musicians at different ages of their careers and to look for a coherence of declined hearing ability and the sound emissions in order to substantiate advices for hearing protection and occupational medicine in musicians. Data from questionnaires (anamnestic data on sound exposure in profession and leisure times, use of hearing protection, self-evaluation of hearing function and hearing deficits), audiometric data and amplitudes of OAE were evaluated from 109 professional musicians aged 30-69 years from three major German orchestras and from 110 students of an academy of music (aged 11-19 years). Sound emissions of the whole orchestra and of single instruments/instrument groups were measured at the orchestra stages and pits during rehearsals and performances. None of the musicians was engaged in noisy hobbies and only a few used hearing protectors regularly. More than 50% of the musicians had a hearing loss of 15 dB(A) and more. Highest losses were found among the strings and the brass players. DPOAE amplitudes coincidently declined with the duration of performing music in the orchestras. Professional musicians aged older than 60 years had a significantly greater hearing loss at 4 and 6 kHz than those aged 30-39 years. Among the strings in one orchestra a dominant hearing deficit in the left ears was observed. Musicians need the same health care for their hearing as workers in noisy industry. A better education on the hearing hazards (use of hearing protectors) as well as sound protection in the rehearsal rooms is necessary. Hearing loss in professional musicians should be accepted as an occupational disease."
"18025758","Hearing impairment among mill workers in small scale enterprises in southwest Nigeria.","This cross-sectional study was conducted among mill workers in a large market in Ibadan, southwest Nigeria. These workers are engaged in small scale businesses with little or no regulation of work exposures. Questionnaires administered to mill workers sought information on personal characteristics, length of time engaged in the job, type of milling done and symptoms of hearing impairment. Noise exposure and hearing impairment were assessed among 85 mill workers. Audiometry was done on mill workers and 45 controls with no known exposure to noise and no history of aural disease. Noise levels at work stations ranged from 88-90dB for small mills and 101-105 for larger mills. None of the workers used hearing protection. Analysis based on total number of ears showed that 56% of the workers had hearing impairment ranging from mild (49%) moderate (6.4%) to severe (0.6%) whilst 33% of the controls had hearing impairment which was mild (26%), moderate (7%) and no severe losses, P = 0.001. There was no association between age and hearing impairment but prevalence of hearing impairment was highest among those who had been engaged in the trade for more than 20 years. There is a need for regulation of small scale enterprises to protect the health of workers. Health education and provision of low cost ear plugs will reduce the occurrence and severity of hearing impairment among these low income workers."
"17999904","[Acoustic trauma in classical music players].","OBJECTIVE: To confirm the existence of acoustic trauma in classical musicians.MATERIAL AND METHOD: Sixty-five volunteers from the Castilla and León Symphony Orchestra were studied. The hearing thresholds of each musician were age-corrected using the ELI and ISO 7029:2000 scales. Furthermore the sound levels of the instruments in this symphony orchestra were studied.RESULTS: We observed that the sound level of the symphony orchestra instruments is higher than the level permitted by law, ie it constitutes a risk for hearing loss. We also found that 4 kHz hearing loss in the 5th percentile among musicians was double the rate that would be expected for age, and that violinists and viola players showed poorer hearing in the left ear.CONCLUSIONS: Classical music causes acoustic trauma in musicians and should be recognized as a professional illness. Musicians are obliged to protect their hearing and to undergo regular check-ups."
"17977289","An assessment of the effect of sound produced in a dental clinic on the hearing of dentists.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of sound produced in a dental clinic on the hearing of dentists in a dental school.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two dentists were evaluated for changes in their hearing thresholds at the Speech and Audiology Department, Manipal College of Allied Health Sciences, Manipal, India. Middle Ear Analyser (MEA), Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA) and Oto-Acoustic Emission (OAE) were used to evaluate changes in the hearing thresholds.RESULTS: There was a change in distortion product (DP) amplitude (temporary shift) in all frequencies. Statistically significant changes were found in the 6 kHz and 4 kHz ranges in the left ear and 6 kHz in the right ear. There was a larger DP shift in the left ear than in the right ear. A comparison of the hearing thresholds of males and females showed a significant difference of 3 kHz in the left ear, where males had a higher hearing loss.CONCLUSION: There were shifts of hearing threshold at 6 kHz and 4 kHz. The danger to hearing from dental clinic working environment in a dental school cannot be underestimated."
"17955688","Comparison of the previous and incoming categorisations of audiograms in the occupational health setting in Ireland.","Audiometry is a useful screening tool used in hearing conservation programmes carried out on our work force. Maintaining healthy hearing is essential as Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL), once established is irreversible. A categorisation system was developed to allow for simple triage by a non-specialist, (an occupational health nurse or audiologist) of Audiograms. Last year a new categorisation of audiograms was introduced in Ireland. I applied the previous categorisation and the new categorisation to 50 audiograms and compared the outcomes of each. The new categorisation results in fewer audiograms requiring referral to a specialist (14% versus 18%), fewer audiograms being classified at a warning level (6% versus 20%), and increases the percentage of normal audiograms (80% versus 60%). The new categorisation is more simplified, accounts for men having slightly worse higher frequency hearing than women and legislates for workers aged 18 years and older."
"17932017","Central auditory processing effects induced by solvent exposure.","OBJECTIVES: Various studies have demonstrated that organic solvent exposure may induce auditory damage. Studies conducted in workers occupationally exposed to solvents suggest, on the one hand, poorer hearing thresholds than in matched non-exposed workers, and on the other hand, central auditory damage due to solvent exposure. Taking into account the potential auditory damage induced by solvent exposure due to the neurotoxic properties of such substances, the present research aimed at studying the possible auditory processing disorder (APD), and possible hearing difficulties in daily life listening situations that solvent-exposed workers may acquire.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty workers exposed to a mixture of organic solvents (xylene, toluene, methyl ethyl ketone) and 50 non-exposed workers matched by age, gender and education were assessed. Only subjects with no history of ear infections, high blood pressure, kidney failure, metabolic and neurological diseases, or alcoholism were selected. The subjects had either normal hearing or sensorineural hearing loss, and normal tympanometric results. Hearing-in-noise (HINT), dichotic digit (DD), filtered speech (FS), pitch pattern sequence (PPS), and random gap detection (RGD) tests were carried out in the exposed and non-exposed groups. A self-report inventory of each subject's performance in daily life listening situations, the Amsterdam Inventory for Auditory Disability and Handicap, was also administered.RESULTS: Significant threshold differences between exposed and non-exposed workers were found at some of the hearing test frequencies, for both ears. However, exposed workers still presented normal hearing thresholds as a group (equal or better than 20 dB HL). Also, for the HINT, DD, PPS, FS and RGD tests, non-exposed workers obtained better results than exposed workers. Finally, solvent-exposed workers reported significantly more hearing complaints in daily life listening situations than non-exposed workers.CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that subjects exposed to solvents may acquire an APD and thus the sole use of pure-tone audiometry is insufficient to assess hearing in solvent-exposed populations."
"17903578","Vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials in chronic noise-induced hearing loss.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of chronic noise exposure on vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with chronic noise-induced hearing loss, presenting as bilateral notched audiogram at 4 kHz, underwent audiometry, caloric, and vestibular-evoked myogenic potential tests.RESULTS: Caloric and vestibular-evoked myogenic potential tests revealed abnormal responses in nine (45%) and 10 (50%) patients, respectively. However, when both results were considered together, the abnormal rate reached 70% (14 of 20). The hearing threshold of 4 kHz significantly associated with vestibular-evoked myogenic potential results (ie, vestibular-evoked myogenic potential was abnormal in patients with greater degrees of hearing loss), but not with caloric responses.CONCLUSION: Patients with bilateral 4-kHz notched audiogram and hearing threshold of 4 kHz &gt; 40 dB may show abnormal (absent or delayed) vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials, indicating that the vestibular part, especially the sacculocollic reflex pathway, has also been damaged."
"17903577","Hyperlipidemia in noise-induced hearing loss.","OBJECTIVES: To assess the influence of hyperlipidemia on the development of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).STUDY DESIGN: This case-control study analyzed data from the Department of Preventive Medicine at one academic medical center in southern Taiwan.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We collected the laboratory data from routine health examinations administered to workers who were exposed to noise greater than 85 dBA over a one-year period. We analyzed the relationships of cholesterol and triglyceride levels with NIHL.RESULTS: A total of 4071 cases were analyzed. After adjusting for age and gender, hypertriglyceridemia was found to be related to NIHL (aOR = 1.281; 95% CI, 1.088-1.507), but hypercholesterolemia was not (aOR = 0.951; 95% CI, 0.795-1.138).CONCLUSIONS: This study, one of the largest to date to study the relationship between hyperlipidemia and NIHL, found that individuals with hypertriglyceridemia are at greater risk of NIHL. On the basis of this finding, workers exposed to high noise levels should be educated on control of triglyceride levels to help reduce their risk of NIHL."
"17851218","Toxic encephalopathy and noise-induced hearing loss.","In several laboratory animal studies, it has been documented that the hearing, vision, and brain can be injured due to exposure to organic solvents. This finding formed the background for a pilot study (n=16) aimed at identifying new ways of qualifying diagnostics, treatment, and rehabilitation of patients suffering from brain injury due to exposure to organic solvents, also referred to as toxic encephalopathy. Diagnosing toxic encephalopathy is complicated because the symptoms of this type of diffuse brain injury are non-specific. So, it was initially hypothesised that some of the difficulties involved in diagnosing toxic encephalopathy could be minimized by extending the diagnostic procedure. Apart from clinical interviewing and neuropsychological testing, the diagnosis should include the examination of hearing and vision. This will help in achieving new measures that could improve in diagnosing toxic encephalopathy with more certainty. On the basis of ranking, only one patient in the pilot study was considered to have a normal neuropsychological test profile, which was defined as a test profile without any marked deviations when compared with a normal population. A total of 10 patients were considered to have &quot;discrete problems.&quot; These patients had a test profile showing either a few strikingly negative results or an array of results slightly below the expected level when compared with a normal population. A total of four patients were considered to suffer from &quot;moderate problems&quot; and one patient from &quot;severe problems.&quot; The patients with &quot;moderate problems&quot; and &quot;severe problems&quot; showed consistent negative results and an unambiguous negative test profile. However, the overall results of all neuropsychological examinations performed revealed a dispersed picture. Quite remarkably, all the 13 patients who had their hearing examined showed a loss of hearing, 7 patients complained about tinnitus, and all patients had a history of exposure to both noise and organic solvents, which had not been observed at the initial examination, but seemed to have serious implications for their prognosis and future life."
"17804978","An assessment of threshold shifts in nonprofessional pop/rock musicians using conventional and extended high-frequency audiometry.","The clinical value of extended high-frequency audiometry for the detection of noise-induced hearing loss has not been established conclusively. The purpose of this study was to assess the relative temporary threshold shift (TTS) in two frequency regions (conventional versus extended high frequency). In this exploratory study, pure-tone thresholds from 0.5 to 14 kHz were measured in both ears of 16 nonprofessional pop/rock musicians (mean age, 35 yr; range, 27 to 49 yr), before and after a 90-minute rehearsal session. All had experienced repeated exposures to intense sound levels during at least 5 yr of their musical careers. After the rehearsal, median threshold levels were found to be significantly poorer for frequencies from 0.5 to 8 kHz (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p &lt;or= 0.004) but were unchanged in the extended high-frequency range from 9 to 14 kHz. Decreases in the median threshold values measured before the rehearsal were present across the conventional frequency range, most notably at 6 kHz, but were not observed in the extended high-frequency range. On the basis of these results, extended high-frequency audiometry does not seem advantageous as a means of the early detection of noise-induced hearing loss."

"17721363","Otoacoustic emissions in early noise-induced hearing loss.","OBJECTIVE: To follow changes in transient evoked and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs, DPOAEs) as they relate to pure-tone audiometry (PTaud) thresholds during the first 2 years of occupational noise exposure.DESIGN: Prospective controlled.METHODS: Pure-tone audiometry thresholds, TEOAE and DPOAE amplitudes, and contralateral medial olivocochlear reflex strength were repeatedly evaluated during 2 years and compared between and within a cohort of 135 ship engine room recruits and a control group of 100 subjects with no noise exposure.RESULTS: Pure-tone audiometry thresholds for 2,000, 3,000 and 4,000 Hz in both ears were significantly elevated in the study group after 2 years of noise exposure. Significantly lower TEOAE amplitudes were found at 2,000 Hz in the right ear and 2,000 and 4,000 Hz in the left ear. Longitudinal intrasubject analysis of the study group revealed significant reductions of TEOAE amplitudes at 2,000 to 4,000 Hz in both ears and reduced DPOAE amplitudes for 5,957 Hz in the right ear and 3,809, 4,736, and 5,957 Hz in the left ear in the second follow-up evaluation. Baseline medial olivocochlear reflex strength showed no correlation to PTaud thresholds after 2 years of noise exposure. Poor to moderate negative linear correlations (r = -0.07 to -0.37) were found between the DPOAE-averaged amplitudes at 2,979 to 5,957 Hz and PTaud threshold means at 3,000 to 6,000 Hz. Abnormal TEOAE parameters after the first year of noise exposure had high sensitivity (86-88%) and low specificity (33-35%) for the prediction of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) after 2 years.CONCLUSION: The DP-gram is not significantly correlated with PTaud and cannot be used as an objective measure of pure-tone thresholds in early NIHL. Medial olivocochlear reflex strength before the beginning of chronic exposure to occupational noise has no relation to individual vulnerability to NIHL. Although TEOAEs changes after 1 year showed high sensitivity in predicting NIHL after 2 years of exposure, they cannot be recommended as an efficient screening tool due to high false-positive rates."
"17671790","Hearing status after an industrial explosion: experience of the AZF explosion, 21 September 2001, France.","OBJECTIVES: Following the explosion of a chemical plant in France, a study was conducted to analyse the relationship between hearing thresholds and distance from the explosion based on post- and pre-blast audiometric data, and to describe the functional symptoms and visits for hearing problems.METHODS: Audiometric tests with standard procedure of 511 workers of a company located near the explosion were proposed and conducted by the occupational medicine department after the explosion. Past occupational noise exposure, past medical history of ear problems, distance from the explosion, functional symptoms and visits for hearing problems following explosion and results of past audiometric tests if available were collected. Workers were classified as &quot;exposed&quot; or &quot;less exposed&quot; according to the distance from the explosion. Mean decibel threshold shifts for each ear were analysed by frequency with Student's t test and by multiple linear regression taking into account confounding factors.RESULTS: Of a total of 425 (83%) of the firm's workers who participated in the study, 49% had received an audiometric test before the explosion. Hearing shift between pre- and post-explosion audiograms was significantly greater for the &quot;exposed&quot; group than for the &quot;less exposed&quot; one at 2,000 and 4,000 Hz (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.001, respectively) and borderline at 6,000 Hz (P = 0.09) for the right ear and at 2,000 (P &lt; 0.01), 6,000 and 8,000 Hz (P &lt; 0.05) for the left ear. Among those of the &quot;exposed&quot; workers who reported any functional symptom following the explosion, 45% did not visit an ENT specialist despite these signs.CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated statistically significant hearing shift from 2,000 to 6,000 Hz in relation with distance from the explosion and showed that even when functional symptoms were present, people did not necessarily seek medical advice. Screening for hearing loss should be recommended for people most exposed to excess acoustic pressure, in order to offer them prevention advice."
"17605828","Interaction of smoking and occupational noise exposure on hearing loss: a cross-sectional study.","BACKGROUND: Noise is the most common hazardous agent at workplaces. Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) has been known since the industrial revolution. Although NIHL is permanent, irreversible and frequent, it is preventable. The economic costs of NIHL have been estimated to be about billions of dollars. Besides, cigarette smoking is a common habit worldwide, and according to some recent studies smoking and noise may act in common causal pathways for hearing loss.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed to study the effect of smoking on NIHL in 206 male smoker workers and 206 male non-smoker workers in a large food-producing factory, in which workers were exposed to noise levels exceeding 85 dBA. To determine noise exposure level, we used sound level measurements reported by industrial hygienists.A qualified audiologist assessed hearing acuity by using standardized audiometric procedures assuring at least 14 h of noise avoidance.RESULTS: We observed that the percentage of workers with hearing threshold differences of greater than or equal to 30 dB between 4000 Hz and 1000 Hz in both ears were 49.5% and 11.2% in smoker and non smoker groups, respectively (Odds ratio = 7.8, 95% CI = 4.7-13), and the percentage of workers with a hearing threshold of greater than 25 dB at 4000 Hz in the better ear were 63.6% and 18.4% in smoker and non smoker groups, respectively. This difference was statistically significant after adjustment for age and exposure duration.CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that smoking can accelerate noise induced hearing loss, but more research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms. Accurate follow up of smoker workers who are exposed to noise levels exceeding 85 dBA is suggested. Smokers should periodically attend educational courses on &quot;smoking cessation&quot;, especially in noisy workplaces."

Study model - a prospective clinical trial.AIM: To study auditory symptoms and audiometric exams of teachers and classroom noise levels.MATERIAL AND METHOD: Data from two groups, GI (40 teachers) and GII (40 voluntaries) were studied as follows: age, gender, working conditions, audiometric exams, and classroom noise levels.RESULTS: In GI there were more females (86%), working in basic teaching (75%), in classes with 21-40 students (70%), with workloads between 26 and 40 hours per week (47%), and variable professional teaching time. Most teachers in GI reported excessive classroom noise (93.5%) and auditory symptoms (65%). In GI, 25% of teachers presented audiometric alterations (versus 10% of controls), with an acoustic notch predominating (11.25%; p&lt;0.05). Noise levels close to 87dBA were recorded in classes at all teaching levels.CONCLUSIONS: occupational hearing loss may occur in teachers. Further studies are needed to confirm this proposition."
"17567727","Organic solvent exposure and hearing loss in a cohort of aluminium workers.","OBJECTIVES: Organic solvent exposure has been shown to cause hearing loss in animals and humans. Less is known about the risk of hearing loss due to solvent exposures typically found in US industry. The authors performed a retrospective cohort study to examine the relationship between solvent exposure and hearing loss in US aluminium industry workers.METHODS: A cohort of 1319 workers aged 35 years or less at inception was followed for 5 years. Linkage of employment, industrial hygiene and audiometric surveillance records allowed for estimation of noise and solvent exposures and hearing loss rates over the study period. Study subjects were classified as &quot;solvent exposed&quot; or not, on the basis of industrial hygiene records linked with individual job histories. High frequency hearing loss was modelled as both a continuous and a dichotomous outcome.RESULTS: Typical solvent exposures involved mixtures of xylene, toluene and/or methyl ethyl ketone (MEK). Recorded solvent exposure levels varied widely both within and between jobs. In a multivariate logistic model, risk factors for high frequency hearing loss included age (OR = 1.06, p = 0.004), hunting or shooting (OR = 1.35, p = 0.049), noisy hobbies (OR = 1.74, p = 0.01), baseline hearing level (OR = 1.04, p&lt;0.001) and solvent exposure (OR = 1.87, p = 0.004). A multivariate linear regression analysis similarly found significant associations between high frequency hearing loss and age (p&lt;0.001), hunting or shooting (p&lt;0.001), noisy hobbies (p = 0.03), solvent exposure (p&lt;0.001) and baseline hearing (p = 0.03).CONCLUSION: These results suggest that occupational exposure to organic solvent mixtures is a risk factor for high frequency hearing loss, although the data do not allow conclusions about dose-response relationships. Industries with solvent-exposed workers should include such workers in hearing conservation programs."
"17513895","Audiological findings in workers exposed to styrene alone or in concert with noise.","Audiological testing, interviews and exposure measurements were used to collect data on the health effects of styrene exposures in 313 workers from fiberglass and metal-product manufacturing plants and a mail terminal. The audiological test battery included pure-tone audiometry, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), psychoacoustic modulation transfer function, interrupted speech, speech recognition in noise and cortical response audiometry (CRA). Workers exposed to noise and styrene had significantly poorer pure-tone thresholds in the high-frequency range (3 to 8 kHz) than the controls, noise-exposed workers and those listed in a Swedish age-specific database. Even though abnormalities were noted on DPOAE and CRA testing, the interrupted speech and speech recognition in noise tests were the more sensitive tests for styrene effects. Further research is needed on the underlying mechanisms to understand the effects of styrene and on audiological test batteries to detect changes in populations exposed to solvents."
"17487670","Music exposure and audiological findings in Brazilian disc jockeys (DJs).","The aim of this study was to examine the music exposure and hearing of disc jockeys (DJs). We conducted personal noise dosimetry on 30 DJs and interviewed them regarding their hearing and their job. We conducted pure-tone audiometry, and transient and distortion product otoacoustic emissions before their exposure to music during their work. This first test was preceded by a period of at least 12 hours without exposure to music or noise. We repeated the pure-tone audiometry and otoacoustic emissions after their music exposure, and poorer performances were registered in all retests. The nightclubs' average sound level ranged between 93.2 to 109.7 dB(A). Statistical analysis showed significant bilateral temporary threshold shifts at all frequencies between audiometry performed pre- and post-exposure to amplified music. Transient otoacoustic emissions showed a significant difference in bilateral amplitude and reproducibility at all frequency bands tested. The comparison of distortion product otoacoustic emissions results pre- and post-music exposure showed there was a significant difference in amplitude. Music exposure was associated with temporary and permanent auditory dysfunction among professional DJs."
"17478967","Effect of exposure to a mixture of solvents and noise on hearing and balance in aircraft maintenance workers.","Aircraft maintenance workers are exposed to a mixture of solvents in the presence of intermittent noise. For this study these workers exposed to solvent mix and noise, were compared with mill workers exposed to noise alone, printed circuit board operatives exposed to solvents alone and those exposed to none who acted as controls. Tympanometry, acoustic reflex thresholds, transient and distortion product otoacoustic emissions, auditory brainstem potentials, nystagmography and posturography were examined. There was a significant effect on pure tone thresholds for both noise and solvents+noise. The distortion product otoacoustic emissions declined with frequency and exhibited lower DP amplitude with noise compared to solvents and noise group. The transient emissions showed a similar effect. Over 32% of subjects with solvent and noise exposure had abnormalities of the auditory brainstem responses in terms of interwave interval prolongation. The mean acoustic reflex thresholds showed a pattern of differences which differentiate noise from solvent and noise groups. The contralateral pathway appears to be differentially affected by solvent exposure. 32% of subjects in the solvents and noise group had an abnormal posturographic finding. In the solvents and noise group 74% had abnormalities of saccades, 56% of pursuit and 45% of optokinetic nystagmus."

"17478963","Sleep quality in noise exposed Brazilian workers.","This study investigated the effect of chronic workplace exposure to excessive noise on sleep quality. It involved 40 male workers aged 33 to 50 years, 20 of whom had been exposed to environmental workplace noise levels of 85 dB or more on 40-hour-a-week jobs. Another 20 workers who were not exposed to excessive noise were used as controls. All subjects were interviewed and submitted to physical examination, pure tone and speech audiometry, immittance testing and nocturnal polysomnography. Comparative analysis demonstrated that the two groups were similar, except for the exposure to noise. Fisher's test comparison of pure tone and speech audiometry and immittance testing revealed mild to moderate noise-induced hearing loss (P &lt; 0.001) in the &gt; or = 85-dB group. Indicators of sleep continuity were abnormal in both groups, demonstrating poor sleep quality; however, sleep quantity was normal. Of the 40 individuals, 13 (32.5%) presented respiratory sleep disorders. Of those 13, 10 presented daytime somnolence according to the Epworth Scale. The Mann-Whitney test showed that sleep was identical in the two groups. Fisher's exact test revealed no association between altered sleep and hearing status in either group. Our results show that active men working 40-hour-a-week in the presence of excessive noise without adequate protection for more than eight years presented with noise-induced hearing loss but their quality or quantity of night sleep was unaffected. Sensori-neural deafness may represent an element of adaptation against noise during sleep."

"17402219","Individual susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss: choosing an optimal method of retrospective classification of workers into noise-susceptible and noise-resistant groups.","OBJECTIVES: Individual susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) depends on the interaction between intrinsic and environmental factors. To proceed with the study on NIHL susceptibility genes an appropriate selection of workers susceptible and resistant to noise is crucial. The aim of the study was to compare four different methods of subject classification by the susceptibility to NIHL in a group of 949 workers of an electric power plant exposed to steady-state noise at the workplace.MATERIALS AND METHODS: One method based the classification of the workers on the international reference standard ISO 1999:1990; from the entire group of workers, 10% of the subjects with the worst hearing thresholds (HT) in the model were categorized as susceptible to NIHL, whereas 10% of the subjects with the best HT were categorized as resistant to noise. According to three other methods, the entire group of workers was first divided into subgroups by age, duration of employment and the level of noise, and then 10% of the subjects at each HT extreme were selected.RESULTS: The first classification allowed to achieve an excellent separation between HT of the susceptible and resistant subgroups. The susceptible subgroup was significantly younger than the resistant one, showed a shorter duration of employment and a lower level of noise exposure, which is in line with the definition of increased vulnerability to NIHL. The three other methods produced poorer separation of HT with smaller or no gap between HT values in subgroups.CONCLUSIONS: The selection of subjects from the entire worker population of a given industry based on the ISO 1999:1990 standard can be regarded as the most reliable method of classification of noise-susceptible and noise-resistant workers to be used in the future genetic studies on NIHL susceptibility genes."
"17348531","Effective compression and noise reduction configurations for hearing protectors.","The author proposed to adopt wide dynamic range compression and adaptive multichannel modulation-based noise reduction algorithms to enhance hearing protector performance. Three experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of compression and noise reduction configurations on the amount of noise reduction, speech intelligibility, and overall preferences using existing digital hearing aids. In Experiment 1, sentence materials were recorded in speech spectrum noise and white noise after being processed by eight digital hearing aids. When the hearing aids were set to 3:1 compression, the amount of noise reduction achieved was enhanced or maintained for hearing aids with parallel configurations, but reduced for hearing aids with serial configurations. In Experiments 2 and 3, 16 normal-hearing listeners' speech intelligibility and perceived sound quality were tested when they listened to speech recorded through hearing aids with parallel and serial configurations. Regardless of the configuration, the noise reduction algorithms reduced the noise level and maintained speech intelligibility in white noise. Additionally, the listeners preferred the parallel rather than the serial configuration in 3:1 conditions and the serial configuration in 1:1 rather than 3:1 compression when the noise reduction algorithms were activated. Implications for hearing protector and hearing aid design are discussed."
"17298149","Hearing-impairment among workers in a surface gold mining company in Ghana.","A study to determine the impact of hazardous noise on workers was conducted in a surface gold mining company in Ghana. The procedure adopted included noise survey, case history, otoscopy and conventional pure-tone audiometry. Five main areas were surveyed for hazardous noise namely, Pit, Processing, Ana Laboratory, Bore-hole and Mess area. The results showed that all the above areas except the Mess area produced noise levels above 85 dBA. Again, a total of 252 workers were seen at the company, and out of this number 59(23%) had the classical noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) at 4 KHz. In addition, NIHL increased as a function of age and duration of exposure. It is also noted that out of 81 workers with a preemployment history of noise exposure, 41(51%) had NIHL. NIHL also varied with regard to job location. 14(6%) of the workers had hearing loss greater than 25 dB at the speech frequencies. Thus, factors not under the control of the company may affect the hearing of an employee."

The procedure adopted included noise measurements, otoscopy, audiometric evaluation and assessment of medical history. The results showed that noise levels in corn mills and saw mills exceed 85dBA. The average noise level measured in the printing industry was 85dBA. It was also found that 23 %, 20 % and 7.9 % of workers in corn mills, saw mills and the printing industry have evidence of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). A highly significant correlation was found between noise exposure level, duration of exposure and the development of NIHL in corm mills and saw mills but not in the printers. Hearing - impairment was also observed at the speech frequencies among some of the workers exposed to hazardous noise. These findings suggest that more specific intervention is required to protect workers exposed to such hazards at the work places employed in this study."
"17272301","Hearing loss, accidents, near misses and job losses in firefighters.","BACKGROUND: The hearing losses of workers exposed to occupational noise have been extensively documented, but no information exists on the level of hearing loss which results in job loss.AIM: To define levels of hearing loss associated with ill-health retirement (IHR), comparing them with existing standards and assessing the extent to which poor hearing contributes to accidents and near misses to assist the development of rational standards for retention.METHODS: All UK local authority fire brigades were approached for information on IHRs due to audiological problems, accident/near-miss totals and the numbers thought to be due to poor hearing in a 60-month period beginning in 1997.RESULTS: Only 15/59 (25%) of brigades provided all information requested, although 50 (85%) and 32 (52%) supplied medical and safety information, respectively, which was used for analysis. Of 3366 IHRs, 135 (4%) were due to audiological problems. When compared to a control group of firefighters of similar age, those taking IHR had worse mean and median hearing losses in all grouped frequencies in both ears than the controls, and this difference always reached statistical significance (P &lt; 0.001), but there was considerable overlap in terms of range of hearing loss in each group. Only 41/31 274 (0.13%) of accidents/near misses reported were believed to result from hearing problems, and seven of these were related to device failure.CONCLUSIONS: Retention criteria based on audiometric grounds alone may result in unnecessary IHRs. Poor hearing is only responsible for a small proportion of accidents and near misses."
"17259699","Susceptibility to tinnitus revealed at 2 kHz range by bilateral lower DPOAEs in normal hearing subjects with noise exposure.","We investigated potential markers of susceptibility to tinnitus in a group of normal hearing young pilots aged 25-35 years and with 8 +/- 5 years of aircraft noise exposure. 316 pilots were interviewed about their tinnitus status and were tested for hearing thresholds (audiograms) and distortion products otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE-grams). There was no subject with permanent tinnitus. 23% reported having occasionally perceived tinnitus after flight missions and 77% reported never having experienced tinnitus after flight missions. General discomfort in the ears to noise was higher in the occasional tinnitus group (15 vs. 6%). The major finding was that difference of susceptibility to tinnitus in normal hearing subjects exposed to noise on a daily basis seemed to be clearly related to lower DPOAEs, bilaterally, in the 1500- to 2800-kHz range. However, no difference could be observed between groups on audiograms at the 2-kHz frequency range. This study provided evidence of outer hair cell dysfunctions in normal hearing subjects exposed to noise and susceptible to tinnitus. Hypersensitivity to noise and decreased DPOAEs in a non-noise-specific frequency range support the idea of another alteration mechanism than noise itself. This point was discussed in the light of recent publications."
"17249147","A psychoacoustical model for specifying the level and spectrum of acoustic warning signals in the workplace.","A psychoacoustic model is presented to facilitate the installation of acoustic warning devices in noisy settings, reflecting a major upgrade of a former tool, Detectsound. The model can be used to estimate the optimal level and spectrum of acoustic warning signals based on the noise field in the workplace, the hearing status of workers, and the attenuation provided by hearing protectors. The new version can be applied to a wider range of situations. Analyses can now be conducted to meet the functional requirements for a specific worker or to suit the needs for a group of co-workers sharing a work area. Computation of optimal warning signals can also be made from estimated hearing parameters based on the worker age, gender, and level and duration of noise exposure. The results of a laboratory validation study showed that the mean error in estimating detection thresholds for normal hearing individuals is typically within +/-1 dB with a standard deviation of less than 2.5 dB in white noise or continuous noise fields. The model tends to yield slightly overestimated warning signal detection thresholds in fluctuating noises. Proper application of the tool also requires consideration of the variability in estimating noise levels, hearing status, and hearing protector attenuation under field conditions to ensure that acoustic warning signals are sufficiently loud and well adjusted in practice."
"17228988","Efficacy of a computer-based hearing test and tailored hearing protection intervention.","Advances in computer technology and accessibility enable researchers to provide individually tailored interventions for behavioral change. Using multimedia technology, this study developed and tested a computer-based hearing test and a tailored intervention. The purpose of this study was to evaluate, using a randomized experimental design, the efficacy of the intervention to increase workers' use of hearing protection. The tailored intervention developed by the research team showed more significant short-term effect measured immediately after the intervention than the control intervention. For the long-term effect measured 1 year after the intervention, both tailored and control groups showed significant increase in their reported use (7% vs. 6%) from preintervention to postintervention, but no significant difference between the two groups. The change accomplished in this study was small progress toward the desired level of 100% use of hearing protection to prevent noise-induced hearing loss. This finding showed that changing workers' hearing protection behavior is difficult."

Several studies led to the definition of a set of descriptors suitable to describe noise in the workplace and its effects in terms of annoyance of the subjects exposed.OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to analyse the performance of different indices in terms of correlation with subjective sensation, taking into account those indices which combine both the intensity and the spectral quality of noise.METHOD: A noise survey was carried out in ten ofice buildings, covering 85 rooms. Objective measurements of environmental noise were made together with subjective evaluations collected through questionnaires. Subjective ratings were then averaged and correlated with objective parameters. Linear regression analyses were performed in order to assess the reliability of objective noise indices.RESULTS: The most important sources of noise were face-to-face and telephone conversations. All spectra had excess high frequency content. Regression analysis showed that under these conditions most noise indics provide a reliable prediction of subjective annoyance. However, the best performing parameter was the A-weighted equivalent sound pressure level followed by the Combined Noise Index which combines noise intensity and its spectral quality."

"19052439","Audiological findings in individuals exposed to organic solvents: case studies.","Millions of people around the world are exposed to industrial organic solvents such as toluene and xylene in the manufacturing sectors. Solvents are neurotoxic substances that are detrimental to the functioning of the nervous system, including the central auditory nervous system (CANS). This study investigated hearing and auditory processing in seven individuals with a history of exposure to industrial solvents. A battery of audiological tests was administered to all subjects: pure tone, speech, and impedance audiometry, otoacoustic emissions tests, auditory brainstem responses, middle latency responses, as well as the SCAN-A and R-SPIN tests with low predictability sentence lists. All individuals in this study exhibited findings consistent with retrocochlear and/or central abnormality. Two of the seven subjects in this study had normal pure tone thresholds at all frequencies bilaterally, yet showed abnormal retrocochlear/central results on one or more tests. The auditory test battery approach used in this study appears to be valuable in evaluating the pathological conditions of the CANS in solvent-exposed individuals."
"19050644","Audiological findings among workers from Brazilian small-scale fisheries.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the noise exposure and hearing of fishermen from small-scale fisheries from the state of Paraná in Brazil.DESIGN: Participants of this cross-sectional study included 141 male fishermen, ages ranging from 18 to 77 yr old and 136 controls matched by socioeconomic level, age, and gender. We conducted personal noise dosimetry and interviewed the fishermen regarding their hearing and their job. Audiological testing performed included pure-tone audiometry in the 0.5 to 8 kHz frequency range, extended high-frequency audiometry in the 9 to 16 kHz range, and transient and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions. Testing was preceded by a period of at least 14 hr without exposure to noise. Participants were subdivided in subgroups according to their noise exposure history.RESULTS: Sound level measurement results ranged from 38 to 58 Leq dB (A) in vessels without an engine and between 90 and 108 Leq dB (A) in vessels with an engine. Results from additional area sound level measurements conducted in five different seating locations in the 9HP engine boat ranged from 86 to 105 dB (A). Statistical analysis of the pure-tone audiometry results showed that fishermen with current or a history of occupational noise exposure had significantly poorer thresholds than controls or unexposed fishermen in several of the tested audiometric frequencies. Results of the otoacoustic emissions testing showed differences between exposed and unexposed groups regarding the presence of responses in bilateral amplitude and reproducibility at all frequency bands tested.CONCLUSIONS: Because of the fishermen's increased risk of hearing disorders, a variety of solutions are recommended, which include dissemination of information on control of noise emissions generated by the boat engines, audiological care, and hearing loss prevention services tailored to workers from small-scale fisheries."

The last test was used to study hearing loss. The mean test values at 3, 4, 6 kHz were used for the ear with worse hearing loss. Data were compared with a Swedish population (n = 603) who were not occupationally exposed to noise. Equivalent noise levels (Leq) were measured in different aircraft.RESULTS: Leq was 78-84 dB (A), maximum A-weighted exposure was 114 dB. Median values for all ages were close to the reference group. No association was found between years of employment and hearing loss, when adjusting for age and gender by multiple logistic regression analysis.CONCLUSION: Cabin crew are exposed to equivalent noise levels below the current Swedish occupational standard, and have normal age-matched hearing threshold levels."
"18949961","Extended high-frequency audiometry in subjects exposed to occupational noise.","OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate hearing in a population of industrial workers exposed to occupational noise by using both conventional and extended high-frequency (EHF) audiometry, and to compare our results with the findings from a control group.METHODS: A total of 139 industry workers exposed to noise were examined over a period of two years and 32 healthy subjects were used as controls. Conventional audiometry in the frequency range 0.25-8 kHz and EHF audiometry in the frequency range 9-20 kHz were performed.RESULTS: Thresholds in the noise-exposed group were higher than in the control group for both standard and extended high frequencies, but variability was greater in EHF. Larger differences were found in the 4,000-18,000 Hz frequency region, and especially in the 12,500-18,000 frequency zone. A statistically significant correlation between the elevation of puretone thresholds and time of exposure was found across all frequencies (from 250 to 20,000 Hz), with the exception of 10,000 Hz.CONCLUSIONS: EHF audiometry is a useful adjunct to conventional audiometry in the audiological assessment of subjects exposed to occupational noise. This test performs well in the frequency range 12,500-18,000 Hz, but there is greater variability in the results compared with conventional audiometry."
"18760091","Association of work-related accidents with noise exposure in the workplace and noise-induced hearing loss based on the experience of some 240,000 person-years of observation.","This retrospective study explores the association between occupational noise exposure at the time of hearing tests, permanent noise-induced hearing loss and work-related accident risk. Log-binomial analysis was used to first ascertain the association between study variables according to activity sector (North American Industry Classification System, NAICS) and accident context while controlling for age. Second part of the paper estimates the overall number of accidents attributable to occupational noise or the associated hearing loss (excess fraction). Study was carried on a sample of 52,982 male workers exposed to a minimum of 80 dBA on a daily basis and whose hearing was examined at least once between 1983 and 1996 by public health authorities of Quebec. These participants evidenced bilateral average hearing threshold levels at 3, 4 and 6 kHz ranging from normal (&lt; or = 15 dB) to hearing loss in excess of 50 dB as a result of chronic occupational noise exposure (subjects otherwise otologically normal). The occupational accident count of these workers was derived from the individual histories registered with the Quebec workers' compensation board for the 1983-1998 period. Results show an association between accident risk and worker's hearing sensitivity. For example, a hearing loss of 20 dB corresponds to a rise of accident risk equal to 1.14 when controlling for age and occupational noise exposure at the time of hearing tests. NAICS economic activity sectors where association is the most noticeable are &quot;Metal Transformation&quot;, &quot;Metal Product Manufacturing&quot; and &quot;Transportation Equipment Manufacturing&quot;. &quot;Passive accidents&quot; (PR per decibel of hearing loss = 1.008; CI 95 (1.007; 1.010)) and &quot;same-level falls&quot; (1.007; CI 95 (1.003; 1.010)) are the two accidents categories most strongly associated with hearing loss. Overall, 12.2% of accidents considered in this study were attributable to a combination of noise exposure in the workplace (&gt; or = 90 dBA) and noise-induced hearing loss."
"18726988","The impact of hearing conservation programs on incidence of noise-induced hearing loss in Canadian workers.","BACKGROUND: Noise exposure remains one of the most ubiquitous of occupational hazards. Hearing conservation program legislation and the programs themselves were designed to lower risk of resulting occupational noise-induced hearing loss, but there has been no broad-based effort to assess the effectiveness of this policy.METHODS: The incidence of a 10-dB standard threshold shift was examined in a group of Canadian lumber mill workers, using annual audiogram series obtained from the Workers' Compensation Board of British Columbia for the period 1979-1996 and using Cox proportional hazard models.RESULTS: Mean cumulative noise exposure was 98.1 dB-years. The audiograms from 22,376 individuals, among whom there were 2,839 threshold shifts of 10 dB or greater (i.e., a &quot;standard threshold shift&quot;), were retained in multivariable analyses. After adjusting for potential confounders, continuous use of hearing protection, and initial hearing tests later in the study period, the risk for standard threshold shift was reduced by 30%. Risk increased sixfold, however, in those with the highest noise exposure.CONCLUSIONS: Hearing conservation programs may be effective in reducing overall incidence of hearing loss. In the absence of noise control at source, however, highly exposed workers remain at unnecessary risk."

"20040978","Occupational noise-induced hearing loss in India.","Noise is the insidious of all industrial pollutants, involving every industry and causing severe hearing loss in every country in the world. Exposure to excessive noise is the major avoidable cause of permanent hearing impairment. Worldwide, 16% of the disabling hearing loss in adults is attributed to occupational noise, ranging from 7 to 21% in the various subregions. The estimated cost of noise to developed countries ranges from 0.2 to 2% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is bilateral and symmetrical, usually affecting the higher frequencies (3k, 4k or 6k Hz) and then spreading to the lower frequencies (0.5k, 1k or 2k Hz). Other major health effects are lack of concentration, irritation, fatigue, headache, sleep disturbances, etc. The major industries responsible for excessive noise and exposing workers to hazardous levels of noise are textile, printing, saw mills, mining, etc. Hearing protectors should be used when engineering controls and work practices are not feasible for reducing noise exposure to safe levels. Earmuffs, ear plugs and ear canal caps are the main types of hearing protectors. In India, NIHL has been a compensable disease since 1948. It is only in 1996 that the first case got compensation. Awareness should be created among workers about the harmful effects of noise on hearing and other body systems by implementing compulsory education and training programs. There are very few published studies of NIHL in India. More extensive studies are needed to know the exact prevalence of NIHL among the various industries in India."
"18616091","Course of hearing recovery according to frequency in patients with acute acoustic sensorineural hearing loss.","Through pure-tone audiometry, we studied the course of hearing recovery in 24 ears of 20 men (ages 18-48 years) who had acute acoustic sensorineural hearing loss (ASHL). All subjects were members of the Japanese Self-Defense Force. The hearing level in 5 ears returned to normal, the hearing level of 13 ears recovered but was not within the normal range, and the hearing level of 6 ears was unchanged. The time from noise exposure to presentation was longer in patients with unchanged hearing than in other patients. Recovery of hearing was poorest at 4,000 Hz, followed by 8,000 and 2,000 Hz. We concluded that hearing in patients with acute ASHL is likely to return to normal when the hearing level at 4,000 Hz recovers gradually; partial recovery of hearing is expected when the hearing level at 4,000 Hz reaches an early plateau."

A total of 634 male and 30 female pilots (N=664) in a Swedish airline company underwent repeated audiological tests during the period 1974-2005. The last test was used to study hearing impairment. The mean values for the hearing test at 3, 4, and 6 kHz were used for the ear with worse hearing impairment. Data was compared with a general adult Swedish population (n=603) not occupationally exposed to noise. Equivalent noise levels gate to gate (Leq) were measured in the cockpit of different aircraft. Leq was 75-81 dB (A), peak exposures were 105 dB (A) from the cabin call signal. Median values were similar as in the reference group at all ages. There was no association between years of employment, tobacco smoking, and hearing impairment, when adjusted for age and gender by multiple logistic regressions analysis. In conclusion, pilots are exposed to equivalent noise levels below the current Swedish occupational standard of 85 dB (A), with short peak exposures above the standard, and have normal age-matched hearing thresholds."
"18587592","Can Rh antigens be a risk factor in noise-induced hearing loss?","Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is one of the most common occupational problems and is one of the main causes of deafness. Many factors cause NIHL. Individual susceptibility is one of them. Rhesus (Rh) antigens and ABO blood groups can be factors in determining individual susceptibility. We aim to investigate the relationship between the Rh antigens and NIHL. The study was conducted in 438 factory workers who had been exposed to a noise level more than 85 dB for 8 h a day for a period of &gt;/=15 years. The audiologic results and blood groups were obtained from the individual health records of the factory workers. We determined NIHL in 236 (53.9%) workers. Two hundred and nineteen (55.4%) of Rh-positive workers and seventeen (39.5%) of Rh-negative workers have NIHL, and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05), whereas no statistically significant difference was determined between the NIHL and ABO blood groups. In conclusion, we suggest that the people with Rh-positive blood group are more prone to develop NIHL."
"18569104","Functionally-based screening criteria for hearing-critical jobs based on the Hearing in Noise Test.","Effective communication is a crucial requirement in many workplaces to ensure safe and effective operations. Often, critical verbal communications are carried out in noise, which can be very challenging, particularly for individuals with hearing loss. Diagnostic measures of hearing, such as the audiogram, are not adequate to make accurate predictions of speech intelligibility in real-world environments for specific workers, and thus are not generally suitable as a basis for making employment decisions. Instead, the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) has been identified and validated for use in predicting speech intelligibility in a wide range of communication environments. The approach to validation of the HINT takes into account the expected voice level of the talker, the communication distance between the talker and the listener, and a statistical model of speech intelligibility in real-world occupational noises. For each hearing-critical task, a HINT screening threshold score is derived upon specification of the minimum level of performance required of the workers. The HINT is available in several languages, so the tools developed are applicable in a wide range of settings, including multilingual workplaces."

To establish age- and sex-adjusted normative hearing thresholds based on results of subjects free of noise and ototoxic drug exposure and to compare them with hearing thresholds of exposed (E) subjects.DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of a longitudinal epidemiologic cohort study.SETTING: Montpellier suburb, south of France.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 778 subjects 70 years old and older were examined. Noise exposure, ototoxic medication use, and medical history were collected. Hearing thresholds were obtained via pure-tone audiometry. After excluding patients with ear-related disease, 659 subjects were further analyzed (270 men and 389 women). Noise or ototoxic medication exposure was found in 364 subjects (E subjects), whereas 295 had no exposure (nonexposed [NE] subjects).METHODS: Median pure-tone thresholds, lower deviation, and upper deviation were calculated for the NE subjects with a statistical method similar to the ISO 7029 norm and were compared with thresholds of E subjects.RESULTS: Hearing thresholds, especially in high frequencies, increased with age more for women than for men. Median thresholds of E subjects were significantly higher than those for the NE sample in men.CONCLUSION: Age- and sex-adjusted hearing thresholds could well be useful in the study of the impact of environmental and genetic factors on hearing loss in the elderly. The next step would be to quantify the impact of noise, ototoxic drug exposure, and genetics using these age- and sex-adjusted thresholds."
"18479630","Occupational noise-induced tinnitus: does it affect workers' quality of life?","OBJECTIVES: This prospective study aimed to investigate the quality of life of workers in a steel factory.METHODS: The study group was composed of 16 male workers with tinnitus and 30 ears. Fifteen male workers without tinnitus and 30 ears were included into the control group. Workers were evaluated by questionnaire, pure-tone audiometry, and the SF-36 Health Survey. In the study group, tinnitus loudness levels (TLLs) were found.RESULTS: In the study group, the domains general mental health and role limitations owing to emotional problems were significantly lower than in the control group. Older age, industrial noise exposure over a long period, higher noise exposure during work, and hearing loss secondary to occupational noise caused workers to experience higher TLLs. Earheadings protected workers more than earplugs, and TLLs were lower. Important factors that affect workers' quality of life are maximum exposed noise levels, daily and total noise exposure time, and exposure to continuous noise. Occupational noise-induced tinnitus mainly causes emotional disability rather than physical disability. Emotionally impaired QOL results may be due to tinnitus-related psychological problems.CONCLUSION: Workers should have knowledge about the hazardous effects of noise. Periodic health checkups and regular seminars have great importance. Workers must be aware of other ototoxic factors, such as medications and noisy music. In the future, researchers should develop a screening method to detect those with a more hereditary affinity to hearing loss."
"18469718","The burdens of age-related and occupational noise-induced hearing loss in the United States.","OBJECTIVES: Aging and noise are generally considered the most common causes of adult hearing loss in developed countries. This study estimates the contributions of aging and occupational noise in the United States.DESIGN: A model of hearing loss burden in American adults was constructed using data from the Census Bureau, from an international standard that predicts age-related and noise-induced hearing loss (ISO-1999), from the American Medical Association method of determining hearing impairment, and from sources estimating the distribution of occupational noise exposure in different age and sex groups.RESULTS: Occupational noise exposure probably accounts for less than 10% of the burden of adult hearing loss in the United States; most of the rest is age-related. Most of the occupational noise burden is attributable to unprotected exposures above 95 dBA, and becomes apparent in middle age, when occupational noise exposure has ceased but age-related threshold shifts are added to prior noise-induced shifts, resulting in clinically significant impairment.CONCLUSIONS: In our current state of knowledge, noise-induced hearing loss is still the most important preventable cause of hearing loss in the United States. The burden of occupational noise-induced hearing loss could probably be reduced by stricter enforcement of existing regulations. Longer lifespans in developed countries and migration of manufacturing jobs to developing countries will continue to reduce the relative contribution of occupational hearing loss in countries like the United States. Preventive interventions for age-related hearing loss, even if only partially effective, could potentially reduce the burden of adult hearing loss more than elimination of occupational noise."
"18468977","Hazards to hearing from combined exposure to toluene and noise in rats.","INTRODUCTION: The main risk of hearing impairment from workplace exposure to organic solvents may stem from the potentiation of effects caused by concomitant noise exposure. The aim of the present study was to identify the main hazards from combined long-term, low-level exposure to noise and aromatic organic solvents, like toluene, in rats.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The rats were exposed to steady-state, wide-band noise (WBN) and 0 ppm, 100 ppm, 200 ppm and 500 ppm toluene for 90 days. Hearing was assessed using Auditory Brain Stem Responses (ABR) and Distortion Product Oto-Acoustic Emissions (DPOAE) eight weeks after exposure. The impact of noise composition on the interaction between solvent and noise exposure was investigated in rats exposed for 10 days either to 0 ppm, 500 ppm, 1000 ppm or 1500 ppm toluene and either WBN or impulse noise. ABR and DPOAE tests were performed before and two weeks after exposure.RESULTS: Long-term exposure of rats to WBN and toluene at 500 ppm or less did not show any increase in hearing impairment, compared to the rats exposed to noise only. Synergistic interaction was demonstrated in short-term exposure to 1500 ppm toluene and both to WBN and impulse noise, but hearing impairment was much larger when following exposure to impulse noise.CONCLUSION: In combined exposure to low-levels of noise and toluene, even a long-term exposure did not reveal a potential hazard of hearing impairment. Synergistic interaction in combined short-term exposure to toluene and noise was noted both with respect to WBN and impulse noise, but the impulse noise was much more disruptive than WBN at the same level of noise exposure. The ototoxicity of organic solvents may primarily be a hazard also to human hearing due to the exacerbation of hearing loss by a possible co-exposure to especially harmful noise, such as impulse noise."
"18462490","Prevalence of high frequency hearing loss consistent with noise exposure among people working with sound systems and general population in Brazil: a cross-sectional study.","BACKGROUND: Music is ever present in our daily lives, establishing a link between humans and the arts through the senses and pleasure. Sound technicians are the link between musicians and audiences or consumers. Recently, general concern has arisen regarding occurrences of hearing loss induced by noise from excessively amplified sound-producing activities within leisure and professional environments. Sound technicians' activities expose them to the risk of hearing loss, and consequently put at risk their quality of life, the quality of the musical product and consumers' hearing. The aim of this study was to measure the prevalence of high frequency hearing loss consistent with noise exposure among sound technicians in Brazil and compare this with a control group without occupational noise exposure.METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study comparing 177 participants in two groups: 82 sound technicians and 95 controls (non-sound technicians). A questionnaire on music listening habits and associated complaints was applied, and data were gathered regarding the professionals' numbers of working hours per day and both groups' hearing complaint and presence of tinnitus. The participants' ear canals were visually inspected using an otoscope. Hearing assessments were performed (tonal and speech audiometry) using a portable digital AD 229 E audiometer funded by FAPESP.RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the sound technicians and controls regarding age and gender. Thus, the study sample was homogenous and would be unlikely to lead to bias in the results. A statistically significant difference in hearing loss was observed between the groups: 50% among the sound technicians and 10.5% among the controls. The difference could be addressed to high sound levels.CONCLUSION: The sound technicians presented a higher prevalence of high frequency hearing loss consistent with noise exposure than did the general population, although the possibility of residual confounding due to unmeasured factors such as socioeconomic status cannot be ruled out."

Pure-tone audiometric thresholds of 32 workers exposed to styrene, but not to noise, in fibreglass reinforced plastic boat manufacturing process were detected and compared to audiometric thresholds of a control unexposed group composed by 60 subjects. Exposure to styrene was measured by urinary mandelic + phenylglyoxylic acid (mean value 149 mg/g crea, SD 80 mg/g crea). For all the frequencies investigated (0,5-1-2-3-4-6-8 KHz) the exposed group showed slight higher mean (median) audiometric thresholds (p &lt; 0.05) compared to controls matched by age and sex, except for 8 KHz in the right ear. The present experience seems to confirm the hypothesis that styrene exposure alone can determine a weak sensorineural high-frequency hearing loss. Such slight impairment, even if statistically significant, does not remarkably limit social hearing and do not involve legal medical aspects. Sample expansion and objective diagnostic tests (auditory brainstem evoked potentials, acoustic otoemissions) are needed."
"18409674","[Extended high frequency audiometry in the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss].","An early detection of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) may allow more effective protection measures. Our aim was to investigate the usefulness of high-frequency audiometry to evaluate the possibility of a future use of the high frequencies audiometry as an early indicator for noise induced hearing loss. A cross-sectional study was performed involving 204 industrial noise exposed and 100 non-industrial noise-exposed workers. Each subject was tested with both conventional-frequency (0.25-8 kHz) and high-frequency (9-18 kHz) audiometry during the annually health surveillance campaign conducted in two Italian cement factories. As expected, noise exposed workers were found to have significantly higher hearing thresholds (P &lt; 0.05) at both conventional and extended high frequencies. Marked differences were found for EHFA. Moreover, significant differences at EHFA were detected also in the subgroup of noise-exposed workers with normal findings at conventional audiometry. Our finding indicate that the use of the extended high frequency test may represent a useful tool for detecting early changes of hearing impairment and that it could be used in addition to the conventional test to better prevent the progression of noise hearing loss."

Environmental noise exposures were on average 88 dB(A), but near 90 dB(A) in some work categories. Workers widely used hearing protection devices, nearly at 93%, during the period we studied. The Evidence Based Occupational Medicine should find out points of reference proving the efficiency and effectiveness of occupational physicians: in this case, a positive trend in the reduction of hearing loss rate will be expected to confirm the goodness of prevention practice. Our study suggests that the levels of protection so far accepted are not effective enough in order to reduce the incidence of noise-induced hearing loss in the course of the years: in despite of most accredited predicting models for hearing conservation programs, a significant percentage of workers exposed to industrial noise continues to present a high incidence of hearing loss. The Evidence Based Occupational Medicine suggests that the proposed prevention activities carried out in the described factories were not enough effective."
"18404896","[Working and health conditions and preventive measures in a random sample of 5000 workers in the Veneto Region examined by telephone interview].","BACKGROUND: A survey was carried out in 2000 by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in a random sample of workers from 15 countries of the European Union in order to obtain information on occupational exposure, health problems and preventive measures taken at the workplaces.OBJECTIVES: To obtain similar information in workers in the Veneto Region and compare the results with those of the third European Survey on Working Conditions (ESWC). The results of the survey on Veneto Region workers were further analyzed, investigating the distribution by risk factors in each work sector, and the association between risk factors and reported health problems.METHODS: The ESWC questionnaire was adapted to the requirements of a telephone interview and a sample of 5000 workers (size based on the budget) between 15 and 64 years of age was randomly extracted from the regional list of telephone subscribers. The questionnaire was administered by trained interviewers. No statistical tests were used in the comparison between ESWC and Veneto Region results due to the lack of a priori hypotheses. Odds ratio (OR) was calculated in estimating the association between risk factors and symptoms; and p-value for OR trend across the increasing level of exposure was also obtained.RESULTS: Workers reported to be exposed for more than a quarter of their work time to: vibrations (20%), noise (19%), dusts, fumes vapours, chemicals (18%), repetitive hand/arm movements (50%), tiring/painful positions (46%); working at very high speed or tight deadlines (60%). 54.4% of the subjects reported working with computers. Taking as a reference the third ESWC in 2000, among Veneto Region workers in 2005 exposure was lower as regards physical, chemical and ergonomic risk factors, and similar as regards working at very high speed. The more frequently reported work-related health problems were: stress (26.9%), backache (17.8%), overall fatigue (11.9%), muscular pains in upper limbs (6.8%), headache (6.1%), sight problems (5.4%), anxiety (5.5%), muscular pain in lower limbs (4.3%), irritability (4.0%), hearing problems (2.3%). Except for stress, all symptoms/health problems were two-three times more frequently reported in the ESWC than in the Veneto Region survey where, conversely, the number of persons with at least one new sick- leave spell was higher. Lastly, there was no difference as regards preventive measures taken at the workplace: information on risks (78.2%), wearing personal protective equipment (28.7%), training paid by employer (28.7%). Among the Veneto Region workers, the most often reported risk factors were exposure to physical and chemical risk factors in industry/agriculture, and shift-work and working at very high speed in the services. The most commonly adopted preventive measures were information on risks and wearing of personal protective equipment in industry, and training in services. Moreover, among the Veneto Region workers, a significant exposure-dependent increase was reported for respiratory problems, allergies, dermatitis, hearing loss, accidents, back pain, pain in the upper and lower limbs, and headache. The risk of stress, anxiety, sleeping problems, stomach pain and headache increased when skills were not adequate to cope with job demand. In contrast, the perception of improved health conditions increased with increasing skill discretion, decision authority, social support (which are dimensions of control of job demand), but not with information on risk, training, or use of personal protective equipment.CONCLUSIONS: Data from the present survey provide useful insights on working and health conditions of workers in the Veneto Region, revealing problems that were subsequently investigated using other sources of information, as reported in the studies published elsewhere in this volume."
"18404276","Noise induced hearing loss and other hearing complaints among musicians of symphony orchestras.","OBJECTIVES: An investigation of the hearing status of musicians of professional symphony orchestras. Main questions are: (1) Should musicians be treated as a special group with regard to hearing, noise, and noise related hearing problems (2) Do patterns of hearing damage differ for different instrument types (3) Do OAE have an added value in the diagnosis of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) in musicians.METHODS: 241 professional musicians, aged between 23-64 participated. A brief medical history and the subjective judgment of their hearing and hearing problems were assessed. Musicians were subjected to an extensive audiological test battery, which contained testing of audiometric thresholds, loudness perception, diplacusis, tinnitus, speech perception in noise, and otoacoustic emissions.RESULTS: Most musicians could be categorized as normal hearing, but their audiograms show notches at 6 kHz, a frequency that is associated with NIHL. Musicians often complained about tinnitus and hyperacusis, while diplacusis was generally not reported as a problem. Tinnitus was most often localized utmost left and this could not be related to the instrument. It was usually perceived in high frequency areas, associated with NIHL. In general, musicians scored very well on the speech-in-noise test. The results of the loudness perception test were within normal limits. Otoacoustic emissions were more intense with better pure-tone thresholds, but due to large individual differences it can still not be used as an objective test for early detection of NIHL.CONCLUSIONS: Musicians show more noise induced hearing loss than could be expected on the basis of age and gender. Other indicators, such as complaints and prevalence of tinnitus, complaints about hyperacusis and prevalence of diplacusis suggest that musicians' ears are at risk. Continuing education about the risks of intensive sound exposure to musicians, with the emphasis on the possible development of tinnitus and hyperacusis and the need for good hearing protection is warranted."

"18393354","Extended high-frequency audiometry and noise induced hearing loss in cement workers.","BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that extended high-frequency audiometry (EHFA) might be more sensitive than conventional audiometry in detecting early signs of hearing impairment. However, this technique has not been adequately tested in an occupational environment. We therefore investigated the usefulness of this method in noise-exposed workers.METHODS: We compared conventional frequency audiometry (0.25-8 kHz) and EHFA (9-18 kHz) in 184 noise-exposed and 98 non-noise-exposed workers.RESULTS: Both methods showed significantly higher threshold levels (P &lt; 0.05) in noise-exposed workers for most of the tested frequencies; however, the differences were more marked for EHFA, especially in young exposed workers. Significant differences in the EHF range were detected also in the subgroup of noise-exposed workers with normal findings at conventional audiometry. Stepwise regression analysis showed that in 21- to 40-year-old workers the noise effect was largely predominant at both conventional audiometry and EHFA, whereas in older subjects the noise effect was predominant up to 6 kHz frequency, the effect of age being significantly greater at higher frequencies.CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that EHFA is more sensitive than conventional audiometry in detecting noise induced hearing loss. However, hearing loss in the EHF range seems an age-dependent phenomenon with progression into the lower speech range frequencies with increasing age. These changes seem to be accentuated in the early years by noise exposure, suggesting that EHFA could represent a useful preventive measure in young exposed workers."
"18363008","Effect of basic military training on hearing in the Singapore Armed Forces.","INTRODUCTION: In the military service, hearing is at risk through exposure to impulse noise from firing and detonations. This study aims at looking into the consequences of military training on hearing acuity, as it would be useful to confirm the effectiveness of the hearing conservation programme in the Singapore Armed Forces.METHODS: A self-controlled study of 118 Singapore military conscripts was carried out, using questionnaires administered by trained personnel and pure tone audiometric assessments performed for both ears. The questionnaire and audiometry were done at the start of basic military training (BMT), with follow-up audiometry done at the end of BMT and one year into vocational military training (VT).RESULTS: 33 military conscripts were excluded subsequently in latter phases of the study. Of the 85 remaining conscripts, 16.5 percent of the study population were found to have abnormal audiograms at the start of BMT. At the end of the BMT phase, the percentage of enlistees with abnormal audiograms was 9.4 percent. By the end of one year of VT, the percentage of enlistees with abnormal audiograms was still 9.4 percent. Analysis of the differences in number of enlistees with hearing loss was done with the McNemar's test, and was found to be statistically insignificant (p-value equals 0.238).CONCLUSION: The prevalence of 16.5 percent abnormal audiograms at the pre-BMT stage is probably related to unfamiliarity with the audiogram testing and/or &quot;temporary threshold shift&quot; effect. There was no significant difference in the number of enlistees with hearing loss upon enlistment and after one year of military training in this cohort of soldiers."
"18317609","A systematic review of the interventions to promote the wearing of hearing protection.","CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Noise-induced hearing loss can only be prevented by eliminating or lowering noise exposure levels. When the source of the noise cannot be eliminated, workers have to rely on hearing protection equipment. The aim here was to summarize the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to enhance the wearing of hearing protection among workers exposed to noise in the workplace.DATA SOURCE: Studies with random assignment were identified by an electronic search of the medical literature up to 2005. Data were double-entered into the Review Manager software, version 4.2.5.DATA SYNTHESIS: Two studies were found. A computer-based intervention tailored to individual workers risks and lasting 30 minutes was not found to be more effective than a video providing general information for workers. A second randomized controlled trial evaluated the effect of a four-year school-based hearing loss prevention program among schoolchildren working on their parents farms. The intervention group was twice as likely to wear some kind of hearing protection as was the control group (which received only minimal intervention). REVIEWERS CONCLUSIONS: The limited evidence does not show whether tailored interventions are more or less effective than general interventions among workers, 80% of whom already use hearing protection. Long-lasting school-based interventions may increase the use of hearing protection substantially. Better interventions to enhance the use of hearing protection need to be developed and evaluated in order to increase the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss among workers."
"18307091","Iris pigmentation and susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss.","The purpose of this retrospective study is to examine the possible association between iris pigmentation and susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss in 2407 noise-exposed workers. The workers were between 16 to 65 years of age and were exposed to 2 to 42 years of work-related noise. Results demonstrated that dark-eyed workers presented a greater percentage of normal pure-tone thresholds than fair-eyed workers. Fair-eyed workers had threshold averages of 25.1 dB (right ear) and 26.0 dB (left ear) at 3, 4, and 6 kHz, which were significantly worse than workers with dark irises, with threshold averages of 15.8 dB and 17.2 dB in the right and left ear, respectively (p&lt;0.01). Fair-eyed workers with less than 10 years of noise exposure had the same audiometric pattern as the dark-eyed workers exposed for more than 10 years. Workers not exposed to noise did not present significant differences in their audiometric pattern as a function of eye colour. These results suggest that iris pigmentation may be an additional indication of susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss."
"18307090","The risk of tinnitus following occupational noise exposure in workers with hearing loss or normal hearing.","The purpose was to investigate the relationship between noise exposure and tinnitus among workers with normal hearing and hearing loss, respectively. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 752 workers employed at 91 workplaces, that were investigated by means of full work-shift noise levels, questionnaire data, and bilateral pure-tone audiometry. Tinnitus was not associated with the present noise level, the duration of noise exposure, or the cumulative noise exposure if participants had normal hearing. As expected, such trends were demonstrated if participants had a hearing handicap. Based on these data, we will be cautious in ascribing tinnitus to noise exposure in our patients' workplaces if they have a normal audiogram. Furthermore our data indicates no risk of noise-induced tinnitus at exposure levels where no hearing loss would be expected, e.g. as usually encountered in non-industrial workplaces."
"18307089","Is the relation of social class to change in hearing threshold levels from childhood to middle age explained by noise, smoking, and drinking behaviour?","Recent work shows that variation in adult hearing function is related both to social class of origin and current social class. This study examines how much of this relationship after adjustment for childhood hearing impairment is explicable by occupational noise, current smoking, and alcohol consumption. A cohort of 9023 persons born in the UK during one week in 1958 was followed periodically, and hearing threshold levels (HTLs) were measured at 1 kHz and 4 kHz at age 45 years. Most (71% and 68%, at 1 kHz and 4 kHz respectively) of the relation to social class of origin of adult HTLs remains after adjustment for these other factors. For the relation to current social class, corresponding values are 64% and 44% (though varying by gender). The magnitude of social class effect is comparable to that of occupational noise. Susceptibility to hearing impairment is likely to be appreciably determined in early childhood."

Sound pressure levels were measured during a rehearsal, indicating mean levels ranging from 96.4 dB(A) to 106.9 dB(A). Subjects answered questionnaires and underwent audiometry. They attended a lecture in which folders and hearing protection aids were provided; subjects were asked to try using the protectors for 3 months.RESULTS: At the end of the study period, 56.2% reported not liking hearing protection, while 43.7 % accepted such protection. The most common complaints were discomfort with sounds (58.8 %) and tinnitus (47%). 77.1% said that music might cause hearing impairment. A statistically significant difference was observed in the right ear at 4 and 6 kHz and at the left ear in 3, 4 and 6 kHz when median thresholds were compared with those from unexposed controls.CONCLUSION: Although most subjects seemed aware of the risk, few took preventive measures against hearing loss. This suggests the need for periodic educational campaigns and specific legislation tailored to music professionals."
"18247880","Noise in the operating rooms of Greek hospitals.","This study is an evaluation of the problem of noise pollution in operating rooms. The high sound pressure level of noise in the operating theatre has a negative impact on communication between operating room personnel. The research took place at nine Greek public hospitals with more than 400 beds. The objective evaluation consisted of sound pressure level measurements in terms of L(eq), as well as peak sound pressure levels in recordings during 43 surgeries in order to identify sources of noise. The subjective evaluation consisted of a questionnaire answered by 684 operating room personnel. The views of operating room personnel were studied using Pearson's X(2) Test and Fisher's Exact Test (SPSS Version 10.00), a t-test comparison was made of mean sound pressure levels, and the relationship of measurement duration and sound pressure level was examined using linear regression analysis (SPSS Version 13.00). The sound pressure levels of noise per operation and the sources of noise varied. The maximum measured level of noise during the main procedure of an operation was measured at L(eq)=71.9 dB(A), L(1)=84.7 dB(A), L(10)=76.2 dB(A), and L(99)=56.7 dB(A). The hospital building, machinery, tools, and people in the operating room were the main noise factors. In order to eliminate excess noise in the operating room it may be necessary to adopt a multidisciplinary approach. An improvement in environment (background noise levels), the implementation of effective standards, and the focusing of the surgical team on noise matters are considered necessary changes."
"18247879","Characterizing noise and perceived work environment in a neurological intensive care unit.","The hospital sound environment is complex. Alarms, medical equipment, activities, and ventilation generate noise that may present occupational problems as well as hinder recovery among patients. In this study, sound measurements and occupant evaluations were conducted in a neurological intensive care unit. Staff completed questionnaires regarding psychological and physiological reactions to the sound environment. A-weighted equivalent, minimum, and maximum (L(Aeq),L(AFMin),L(AFMax)) and C-weighted peak (L(CPeak)) sound pressure levels were measured over five days at patient and staff locations. Acoustical descriptors that may be explored further were investigated, including level distributions, restorative periods, and spectral content. Measurements near the patients showed average L(Aeq) values of 53-58 dB. The mean length of restorative periods (L(Aeq) below 50 dB for more than 5 min) was 9 and 13 min for day and night, respectively. Ninety percent of the time, the L(AFMax) levels exceeded 50 dB and L(CPeak) exceeded 70 dB. Dosimeters worn by the staff revealed higher noise levels. Personnel perceived the noise as contributing to stress symptoms. Compared to the majority of previous studies, this study provides a more thorough description of intensive care noise and aids in understanding how the sound environment may be disruptive to occupants."

"18212468","The effects of noise on hearing and oxidative stress in textile workers.","The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of noise on hearing, lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzymes in textile workers. Thirty textile workers exposed to high noise 105 dB (A) in a textile factory, and 30 healthy male volunteers in our hospital as a control group were included in the study. In both groups, following audiometric tests, blood samples were obtained. In these blood samples, Malonydialdehyte (MDA), Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase (CAT) levels were investigated. Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS version 11.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago 1L) software program. Mean pure tone audiometric thresholds in workers were significantly higher than in control subjects at frequencies 2,000, 4,000 and 6,000 Hz (p&lt;0.05). Hearing losses were more evident at high frequencies (4-6 kHz) than at low frequencies in worker group. (p&lt;0.05). It was observed that textile workers with longer employment duration had poorer hearing threshoulds and the hearing loss had started on those who had worked for 5-8 yr. While MDA levels were significantly higher in workers than controls (p&lt;0.001), CAT activity was significantly lower (p&lt;0.005). Also, SOD activity was lower in workers but difference was not statistically significant. We observed a significant change in hearing threshold of the textile workers compared with that of the control group. Increase in MDA level and decreases in CAT and SOD activities in textile workers, support the opinion that the noise causes the oxidative stress. The fact that noise both causes hearing loss and increases oxidative stress suggests that there may be a relationship between the oxidative stress and hearing loss. But, further studies are needed in order to verify this opinion."
"18189556","Annoyance due to single and combined sound exposure from railway and road traffic.","Environmental noise is a growing and well recognized health problem. However, in many cases people are exposed not to a single noise source-for example, road, railway, or aircraft noise-but to a combination of noise exposures and there is only limited knowledge of the effects on health of exposure to combined noise sources. A socio-acoustic survey among 1953 persons aged 18-75 years was conducted in residential areas exposed to railway and road traffic noise with sound levels ranging from L(Aeq,24h) 45-72 dB in a municipality east of Gothenburg, Sweden. The objectives were to assess various adverse health effects, including annoyance, and to elucidate the impact of exposure to single and combined noise sources. In areas exposed to both railway and road traffic, the proportion annoyed by the total traffic sound environment (total annoyance) was significantly higher than in areas with one dominant noise source (rail or road traffic) with the same total sound exposure (L(Aeq,24h,tot)). This interaction effect was significant from 59 dB and increased gradually with higher sound levels. Effects of the total sound exposure should be considered in risk assessments and in noise mitigation activities."
"18165194","Relationship between styrene exposure and hearing loss: review of human studies.","Styrene is an aromatic solvent belonging to the alkylbenzene family. Occupational exposure to styrene occurs mainly in the manufacturing of fiberglass-reinforced polyester products, e.g. reinforced plastics and composites. Since 1988, nine studies have been published on the relationship between occupational exposure to styrene and hearing loss. All studies were the cross-sectional epidemiological studies or clinical studies from occupational health clinics. A total of more than 1000 workers exposed to styrene, both with and without concurrent noise exposure, were examined using different outcome measures for hearing loss. Exposure assessment was usually based on styrene measurements in the breathing zone during several hours of one working day. Some of the studies employed also the biological monitoring of styrene exposure based on determination of its urinary metabolites. The current exposures to styrene varied between 2 and 35 ppm. In some studies, lifetime exposure was calculated using company records and questionnaire data. The current exposure to noise was estimated by noise dosimetry or standard noise measurements. Lifetime noise exposure was assessed using questionnaire data and occupational noise estimates. In many studies, noise-exposed groups were used as controls together with the unexposed workers. Of the nine studies, seven show some effects on the auditory system that were associated with styrene-alone exposure. These effects are examined using different outcome measures such as pure tone audiometry, high frequency hearing loss, and central hearing tests. In some studies, an increased risk for hearing loss was associated with exposure estimates."
"20024522","Occupation and the risk of hearing impairment--results from the Nord-Trøndelag study on hearing loss.","OBJECTIVES: We studied the effect of occupation on hearing and if it remained after adjustment for noise exposure, education, income, and other risk factors.METHODS: Audiometry and a questionnaire concerning exposure was administered to a general adult population sample in Norway (N=49,948). Information on occupation, education, and income was obtained from population census registers.RESULTS: Occupation had marked effects on hearing loss. Occupation explained 2-3% of the variance in hearing loss among men &gt; or =45 years in addition to the hearing loss due to age (10-19%). Occupation explained &lt; or =1% of hearing loss among women of all ages and young men. Controlling for self-reported occupational noise exposure reduced the occupational effect by 20-40% in men &gt; or =45 years. Controlling for leisure-time noise, ear infections, and head injuries did not change the effect of occupation, which was slightly reduced after controlling for education and income. The most elevated hearing thresholds in men were observed among: wood workers; miners; linemen and cable jointers; construction carpenters and workers; seamen; and workshop mechanics.CONCLUSIONS: There was a moderate association between occupation and hearing loss. Unbiased estimates of occupational hearing loss may help identify high-risk occupations, for which interventions are needed, and identify individuals with hearing loss."

Ten patients had unilateral tinnitus, and 20 had bilateral tinnitus. All presented with a typical NIHL audiogram on the affected side(s). None of the patients was receiving drug therapy.RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in tinnitus pitch or loudness between the 2 tests for the whole group and separately in patients with unilateral or bilateral tinnitus.CONCLUSION: Subjective testing of pitch and loudness of tinnitus secondary to NIHL is accurate and reproducible, making it a valuable tool for diagnosis and follow-up. The lack of differences between patients with unilateral or bilateral tinnitus indicates that both types may be managed in a similar manner."
"19925346","The effect of tightened hearing protection regulations on military noise-induced tinnitus.","The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of tightened hearing protection regulations on tinnitus in the Finnish Defence Forces. The initial study group comprised 252 officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs), of which 229 were included in the final study group. Subjective symptoms of tinnitus and audiometric test results for these officers and NCOs examined before retirement, from 1984 to 1986 (Period I), and 2003 to 2005 (Period II), were reviewed. Changes in tinnitus reports between the two time periods, during which regulations had been revised, were investigated. Prevalence of tinnitus showed a decline both in officers (from 68% to 63%) and in NCOs (from 76% to 72%) between the two study periods, in accordance with tightened hearing protection regulations. The Cox regression analysis showed a significantly decreased hazard ratio for constant or disturbing tinnitus for Period II. Tinnitus prevalence, especially constant or disturbing tinnitus, in the Finnish Defence Forces was diminished by tightened hearing protection regulations. Tinnitus might be more persistent than hearing loss and does not necessarily improve in direct relation to hearing loss after protective measures."
"19914970","Hearing symptoms and audiometry in professional divers and offshore workers.","AIMS: The aims are to compare hearing loss between professional divers and offshore workers and to study whether hearing loss symptoms reflected physical disorder. A secondary objective was to study total threshold shift assessment as a method of detecting noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).METHODS: Participants (151 divers and 120 offshore workers) completed a questionnaire for symptoms and screening audiometry. Audiograms were assessed for total threshold shift at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 kHz and the prevalence of referral (within population 5th centile) or warning levels (within population 20th centile) of hearing loss. Audiograms were assessed for an NIHL pattern at four levels by two occupational physicians.RESULTS: Hearing loss symptoms were commoner in divers at all levels of hearing loss regardless of differences between groups on audiometry. Hearing loss in offshore workers was within the population age-adjusted norm. Thirteen per cent of divers were within the 5th percentile for threshold shift for the population norm in contrast to 4% of offshore workers and this was predominantly left sided (OR 3.16, 95% CI 1.13-8.93). This difference was lost after adjustment for history of regular exposure to explosion or gunfire. Divers were more likely to have a pattern of severe NIHL on the left (OR 4.61, 95% CI 1.39-15.39, P &lt; 0.05). Approximately 50% of participants with severe NIHL did not have a referral level of hearing loss.CONCLUSIONS: Divers suffer more NIHL than a control population. Current guidance on the assessment of total threshold shift for the detection of significant NIHL was inadequate in the sample studied."

Speech intelligibility was assessed using the modified rhyme test in an intensive care unit environment. Respirators decreased speech intelligibility by a range of 1% to 17%, although not all were statistically significant. Differences in speech intelligibility associated with surgical masks and disposable filtering facepiece respirators (without exhalation valves) were not statistically significant compared with controls. Wearing half-face elastomeric respirators with voice augmentation equipment was associated with higher speech intelligibility than models without this equipment (OR = 2.81). Hearing clarity while wearing a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) was 79% compared with 90% with no PAPR (OR = 0.40). While some respirators appear to have little or no effect on speech intelligibility, interference with speech intelligibility associated with certain types of respirators commonly worn by U.S. healthcare workers may be substantial."

DNA samples were collected from the 10% most susceptible and the 10% most resistant individuals. Four SNPs in the introns of SOD1 were genotyped and their effects and interactions with noise exposure were analyzed.RESULTS: Genotype AA of rs2070424 conferred protection against NIHL (adjusted OR = 0.45, p = 0.005), while GG of rs10432782 was a risk genotype (adjusted OR = 1.88, p = 0.026).

Significant interactions between SOD1 SNPs and noise levels were found. Further analysis of effects of SOD1 SNPs found that those carrying GG genotype of rs10432782 had significantly higher SOD1 activity (p = 0.022), but a significantly lower level of malondialdehyde in plasma, compared with TT carriers (p = 0.007)."

BEAP tests were carried out and the traces were analyzed.RESULTS: in the NIHL group, the auditory thresholds in 3, 4 and 6 kHz were significantly higher in the left ear. In the NIHL group, potentials PI, PIII and/or PV were not present in a small number of the individuals; we observed a statistically significant increase in PI, PIII and PV absolute latencies, (LIP) LIP I-III interpeak latencies, bilaterally and LIP I-V in the left ear.CONCLUSION: in the NIHL group, besides sensorial injury, changes in BEAP latencies suggest an early functional injury of the first auditory pathway afferent neuron."
"19887518","Cigarette smoking and occupational noise-induced hearing loss.","BACKGROUND: Noise is the most common occupational hazard. Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a known occupational disease. The economic costs of NIHL have been estimated to be billions of dollars. Besides, cigarette smoking is a common habit worldwide.METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we surveyed the effect of smoking on NIHL in 504 workers in a large wagon manufacturing company exposed to noise &gt;85 dBA. All required data were obtained using direct interview and questionnaires. To determine noise exposure level, we used industrial hygienist's reports of sound level measurements. A qualified audiologist assessed hearing status using standardized audiometric examination.RESULTS: We concluded that the frequency of hearing loss in smokers was higher than non-smokers [based on Model 1: odds ratio (OR) = 9.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 5.74-15.22 and P-value &lt; 0.001; and based on Model 2: OR = 9.06, 95% CI = 5.93-13.84 and P-value &lt; 0.001]. Besides, these results were confirmed by logistic regression statistical method.CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that smoking may accelerate NIHL, but for confirming this opinion, further studies are warranted."
"19880028","Effect of manganese-superoxide dismutase genetic polymorphisms IVS3-23T/G on noise susceptibility in Taiwan.","PURPOSE: The aim of the study is to investigate the distribution of manganese-superoxide dismutase (SOD2) genetic polymorphisms IVS3-23T/G and their influence on noise susceptibility in Asians.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Questionnaires about history of noise exposure were administered to factory workers, and audiometric data and blood specimens were obtained during their routine annual health examinations. The SOD2 typing was extended with polymerase chain reaction and screened with single-strand conformation polymorphism. The associations of genetic polymorphisms with noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) were analyzed.RESULTS: The allele frequencies of T and G in the population of this study were 0.868 and 0.132, respectively. In 200 screened participants, individuals with T/G genotype were significantly more vulnerable to noise (adjusted odds ratio, 6.222; 95% confidence interval, 1.498-25.855) than the wild type (ie, T/T) by logistic regressions.CONCLUSIONS: The distributions of SOD2 genetic polymorphisms for Asians are different from those reported on Europeans. Individuals with T/G genotype were more vulnerable to noise. This single nucleotide polymorphism is worthy of more studies for the application to NIHL monitoring."
"19853647","Education, occupation, noise exposure history and the 10-yr cumulative incidence of hearing impairment in older adults.","The purpose of this study was to determine the 10-yr cumulative incidence of hearing impairment and associations of education, occupation and noise exposure history with the incidence of hearing impairment in a population-based cohort study of 3753 adults ages 48-92 yr at the baseline examinations during 1993-1995 in Beaver Dam, WI. Hearing thresholds were measured at baseline, 2.5 yr-, 5 yr-, and 10-yr follow-up examinations. Hearing impairment was defined as a pure-tone average (PTA)&gt;25 dB HL at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. Demographic characteristics and occupational histories were obtained by questionnaire. The 10-yr cumulative incidence of hearing impairment was 37.2%. Age (5 yr; Hazard Ratio (HR)=1.81), sex (M vs W; HR=2.29), occupation based on longest held job (production/operations/farming vs others; HR=1.34), marital status (unmarried vs married; HR=1.29) and education (&lt;16 vs 16+yr; HR=1.40) were associated with the 10 yr incidence. History of noisy jobs was not associated with the 10-yr incidence of hearing impairment. The risk of hearing impairment was high, with women experiencing a slightly later onset. Markers of socioeconomic status were associated with hearing impairment, suggesting that hearing impairment in older adults may be associated with modifiable lifestyle and environmental factors, and therefore, at least partially preventable."
"19848096","[Noise-induced hearing loss: are health service surveillance programs always effective?].","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate noise-induced hearing loss in a group of workers at a steel engineering works over a 20 year period (1979-1999).METHODS: A total of 2431 audiometric tests were performed in 708 workers (in 1979, 1984, 1989, 1994 and 1999). Audiometric tests were classified so that hearing loss could be assessed over time. Additionally, personal noise exposure was measured for each worker (average, 85 dB(A) in tests carried out in 1992, 1996 and 1999).RESULTS: Over 5 years of noise exposure, mean cumulative incidence of noise-induced hearing loss was 8,2%. Over 10 years ofexposure (1979-89 or 1984-94 or 1989-99), the mean incidence was 15,3%. This percentage increased to 22,9% and 25,7% when the exposure lasted 15 or 20 years respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The considerable incidence of noise-induced hearing loss within the wide group of steel workers examined greatly exceeds the expected incidence related to the occupational exposure limits. The Evidence Based Occupational Medicine suggests that our health surveillance was not effective enough."
"19821342","Interventions to promote the wearing of hearing protection.","BACKGROUND: This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 2, 2006. The original review was republished in Issue 2, 2009 with feedback incorporated.Noise induced hearing loss can be prevented by eliminating or lowering noise exposure levels. Where the source of the noise cannot be eliminated, workers have to rely on hearing protection equipment. Several trials have been conducted to study the effectiveness of interventions to influence the wearing of hearing protection.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to enhance the wearing of hearing protection among persons regularly exposed to high noise levels.SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 4 February 2009.SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies if they had a randomised design, if they were among noise exposed (&gt; 80 dB(A)) persons, if they included an intervention to promote the wearing of hearing protection (compared to another intervention or no intervention), and if the outcome measured was the amount of use of hearing protection or a proxy measure thereof.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors selected relevant trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data.MAIN RESULTS: Six studies, involving 3917 participants, were included.A computer-based intervention lasting 30 minutes, tailored to the risk of an individual worker, was not found to be more effective than a video providing general information among workers, around 80% of whom already used hearing protection.A four year school-based hearing loss prevention programme found that the intervention group was twice as likely to wear some kind of hearing protection as the control group that received baseline hearing test and two additional tests at years two and three.We conducted two meta-analyses for the comparisons 'tailored strategy (the use of communication or other types of interventions that are specific to an individual or a group and aim to change behaviour) versus non-tailored strategy' and 'tailored strategy versus a commercial video on the use of hearing protection' to look at mean percentage use of hearing protective devices (HPDs), that showed improvement in the mean use of HPDs for the tailored group.Tailored education showed an improvement in HPD use of 8.3% versus targeted education (6.1%).AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence found in this review shows that some interventions improve the mean use of hearing protection devices compared to non-intervention. Future trials should have standard outcomes and interventions to allow the combining of results in meta-analysis."
"19817237","Hearing loss in civilian airline and helicopter pilots compared to air traffic control personnel.","INTRODUCTION: In order to investigate possible hearing loss as a consequence of aviation noise, a comparative analysis of audiometric data from Norwegian Air Traffic Control (ATC) personnel, airline (fixed-wing) pilots, and helicopter pilots was performed. The results may be of use in giving advice regarding preventive measures.METHODS: Male ATC, airline, and helicopter pilots were selected randomly from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) medical files. There were 182 subjects included in the study: 50, 81, and 51 subjects for ATC, helicopter, and airline pilots, respectively. Two audiograms with a 2-3-yr interval were analyzed for each individual. Age correction was performed using data from ISO 7129. Threshold changes per year for the frequencies 3, 4, and 6 kHz were examined in particular after age correction.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: For all three groups, mean hearing threshold levels were above (worse than) ISO 7129 predictions for most frequencies. As expected, hearing thresholds increased with age in the group as a whole. Looking at the 3-, 4-, and 6-kHz frequencies in particular, all groups had small but highly significant increases in hearing thresholds at 4 kHz between the first and second audiogram.CONCLUSIONS: The mean hearing thresholds for this group of aviation personnel are higher than International Standard ISO-7129 would predict according to age. Highly significant changes in hearing threshold after age correction, indicating possible noise-induced hearing loss, were found in all groups at 4 kHz. The fact that helicopter pilots had similar hearing loss to their other aviation colleagues indicates that current hearing protection for these pilots is effective in counteracting the increased noise levels in helicopters."
"19786896","Peripheral and central auditory dysfunction induced by occupational exposure to organic solvents.","OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of solvent exposure on hearing function, through an audiological test battery, in a population not occupationally exposed to high levels of noise.METHODS: One hundred ten workers from a coating factory were studied. Jobs at the factory were divided into three different levels of solvent exposure. Hearing status was assessed with a test battery including pure-tone hearing thresholds (0.5-8 kHz), high-frequency hearing thresholds (12 and 16 kHz), and dichotic listening measured through dichotic digits test. Multiple linear regression models were created to explore possible association between solvent exposure and each of the hearing outcomes.RESULTS: Significant associations between solvent exposure and the three hearing outcomes were found. Covariates such as age, gender, race, and ethnicity were also significantly associated with the studied hearing outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: Occupational exposure to solvents may induce both peripheral and central auditory dysfunction. The dichotic digits test seems as a sensible tool to detect central auditory dysfunction associated with solvent exposure. Hearing loss prevention programs may use this tool to monitor hearing in solvent-exposed workers."
"19757712","Frequency of hearing loss among textile industry workers of weaving unit in Karachi, Pakistan.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of hearing loss among textile industry workers of weaving department. To record the noise level in the weaving sections and to compare it with the international standards. To determine the awareness about the effects of noise on hearing amongst the workers and the protective measures adopted by them.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out at weaving department of five renowned textile industries of Karachi. The study included 248 workers exposed to noise, through non-probability convenient sampling technique. Equivalent sound pressure level Leq was measured with the help of a Class-1 type digital sound level meter. Hearing status of the workers was assessed through questionnaire and clinical tests (WHISPER, RINNE'S and WEBER).RESULT: Results showed that noise level was in range of 88.4-104 dB(A). The questionnaire results showed that: (i) 92.7% of the workers were aware that high noise level cause speech interference. (ii) 57.2% were unaware about the effect of noise on health. (iii) 54.8% used ear protection devices. (iv) 22.5% did not respond well to whisper test while 16.9% were found to have defective hearing on the basis of Rinne's test and 17.4% through Weber's test. It was observed that hearing loss was significantly associated with working experience of more than 10 years (25%) and overtime (28.8%).CONCLUSION: The results of study establish the fact that noise level is more than acceptable limit of 85 dB(A) for 8 hours exposure stipulated by OSHA.There is an immediate need to develop and implement noise regulations in Pakistan."
"19739755","Role of mask pattern in intelligibility of ideal binary-masked noisy speech.","Intelligibility of ideal binary masked noisy speech was measured on a group of normal hearing individuals across mixture signal to noise ratio (SNR) levels, masker types, and local criteria for forming the binary mask. The binary mask is computed from time-frequency decompositions of target and masker signals using two different schemes: an ideal binary mask computed by thresholding the local SNR within time-frequency units and a target binary mask computed by comparing the local target energy against the long-term average speech spectrum. By depicting intelligibility scores as a function of the difference between mixture SNR and local SNR threshold, alignment of the performance curves is obtained for a large range of mixture SNR levels. Large intelligibility benefits are obtained for both sparse and dense binary masks. When an ideal mask is dense with many ones, the effect of changing mixture SNR level while fixing the mask is significant, whereas for more sparse masks the effect is small or insignificant."
"19703868","Effect of ambient sound masking on the accuracy of computerized speech recognition.","PURPOSE: To evaluate the direct effect that sound masking has on computerized speech recognition (SR) accuracy in the digital reading room while eliminating the Lombard effect.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study complies with HIPAA requirements, and the institutional review board determined that approval was not required; informed consent was obtained. Ten radiologists digitally recorded 20 selected reports. Recorded reports were transcribed by using a commercial SR system at sound-masking levels 1-4, representing lowest to highest A-weighted sound pressure measurements in decibels. Dictated reports were compared with original reports to determine numbers of errors. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was used for overall comparison of mean percentage of transcription inaccuracies across sound-masking levels, and paired t tests were used to compare each sound-masking level to the baseline.RESULTS: Mean percentage of transcription inaccuracies at baseline was 11.6% (range, 6.3%-26.1%). Mean percentages of transcription inaccuracies at sound-masking levels 1-4 were 11.3%, 12.3%, 13.0%, and 13.6%, respectively. Mean percentages of transcription inaccuracies differed across all sound-masking levels (P &lt; .001) but not between baseline and sound-masking level 1 (P = .313). Mean percentages of transcription inaccuracies at sound-masking levels 2-4 were each significantly higher than at baseline (P &lt; .01 for each).CONCLUSION: Low-level sound masking provided slightly but not significantly improved SR accuracy, whereas higher levels decreased transcription accuracy. Appropriate levels of sound masking in reading room environments may decrease the negative effect of ambient noise without a deleterious effect on SR accuracy."

To evaluate the work environment, we observed the entire setting, aiming at checking sound intensities in an eighth frequency filter.RESULTS: We carried out 192 hearing threshold evaluations after an occupational anamnesis. Concerning NIHL, we noticed that 49% of the audiometry results presented hearing deterioration in the acute frequencies. We studied the mean values and standard deviations for frequencies over 3,000Hz, in all workers, and we observed that the highest average values were in the frequency of 6,000Hz. We did not notice any association among frequency bands carrying intense noise levels and the hearing damage frequency.CONCLUSION: Noise intensity seems to be the main risk factor for loss hearing, regardless of frequency range."
"19643173","Glutathione S-transferase M1, T1, and P1 polymorphisms as susceptibility factors for noise-induced temporary threshold shift.","The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is thought to be part of the mechanism underlying noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Glutathione is an important cellular antioxidant that limits cell damage by ROS. We aimed to determine the effect of genetic polymorphisms of glutathione S-transferase (GST) T1, GSTM1, and GSTP1, on temporary threshold shift (TTS) in 58 noise-exposed male workers from a steel factory. The pre-shift hearing impairment at high frequency (HF, average of 3, 4, and 6kHz) was 30.7dB HL (S.D.=19.3). The amount of daily noise exposure was 83.0dBA (S.D.=5.0). Noise-induced TTS at HF by pure-tone audiometry (PTA) was related to the daily noise exposure (p&lt;0.05). Based on combinatory analysis, we found that individuals carrying all genotypes with GSTT1 null, GSTM1 null, and GSTP1 Ile(105)/Ile(105) were more susceptible to NIHL. These results suggest that pre-shift hearing impairment and daily noise exposure had impacts on TTS at HF by PTA. In addition, GST genetic polymorphisms may modify the susceptibility to noise-induced TTS."
"19633561","Notched audiograms and noise exposure history in older adults.","OBJECTIVE: Using data from a population-based cohort study, we compared four published algorithms for identifying notched audiograms and compared their resulting classifications with noise exposure history.DESIGN: Four algorithms: (1) , (2) , (3) , and (4) were used to identify notched audiograms. Audiometric evaluations were collected as a part of the 10-yr follow-up examinations of the Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study, in Beaver Dam, WI (2003-2005, N = 2395). Detailed noise exposure histories were collected by interview at the baseline examination (1993-1995) and updated at subsequent visits. An extensive history of occupational noise exposure, participation in noisy hobbies, and firearm usage was used to evaluate consistency of the notch classifications with the history of noise exposure.RESULTS: The prevalence of notched audiograms varied greatly by definition (31.7, 25.9, 47.2, and 11.7% for methods 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). In this cohort, a history of noise exposure was common (56.2% for occupational noise, 71.7% for noisy hobbies, 13.4% for firearms, and 81.2% for any of these three sources). Among participants with a notched audiogram, almost one-third did not have a history of occupational noise exposure (31.4, 33.0, 32.5, and 28.1% for methods 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively), and approximately 11% did not have a history of exposure to any of the three sources of noise (11.5, 13.6, 10.3, and 7.6%). Discordance was greater in women than in men.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that there is a poor agreement across existing algorithms for audiometric notches. In addition, notches can occur in the absence of a positive noise history. In the absence of an objective consensus definition of a notched audiogram and in light of the degree of discordance in women between noise history and notches by each of these algorithms, researchers should be cautious about classifying noise-induced hearing loss by notched audiograms."
"19597738","The effect of active sonar for the protection of moored and anchored warships on the human hearing.","This study wants to show the effects of active middle frequency sonar on a selected group of Italian Navy divers. Ten male divers with normal hearing were exposed to active sonar of the Italian Navy for more than 100 exposures, each of at least 1-h duration, in the course of 6 months. Before, at the end, and six months after the end of noise exposure, we performed pure-tone audiometry, Carhart test, Peyser test, thresholds of discomfort test (TDT), tympanometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), and auditory brainstem response (ABR). At the end of the noise exposure, the audiological tests showed a worsening of the mean air and bone audiometric thresholds at the 2,000 (1/10), 4,000 (7/10), and 8,000 Hz (6/10); a fail status of the TEOAE and DPOAE, which were previously present, in all the divers; temporary threshold shift, at the Peyser test, in 9/10 divers; discomfort for pulse tone presented at the TDT test, in all the divers; no post exposure significant differences at the Carhart and ABR tests, in any of the divers. Six months after the end of noise exposure, all the divers presented a complete recovery of their audio-vestibular functions. Our results show the temporary negative effects of repeated and lasting exposure to active sonar (Hull MF) on the divers; the last control demonstrate the absence of permanent noise-induced hearing loss in divers exposed to active sonar."

Test results were categorized as defined by Merluzzi. Individuals complaining of tinnitus answered the adapted and validated Brazilian Portuguese version of the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory. A generalized linear model was adjusted for binomial data to test the interaction between these factors.RESULTS: Over 60% of the ears analyzed had hearing loss, while more than 46% of them had tinnitus. Tinnitus prevalence and risk rates increased as pure tone audiometry results got worse. The association between both, considering all hearing loss degrees, was statistically significant.CONCLUSION: The results point to a statistical association between hearing loss and tinnitus; the greater the hearing loss, the greater the discomfort introduced by tinnitus."
"19580230","[Hearing damage as a consequence of firefighters' professional exposure to noise].","The aim of the study was to find out whether firefighters' professional exposure to the noise of sirens, motor water pumps and transportation by heavy vehicles causes biauricular hearing impairment. Furthermore, on the basis of the results the aim was to find out whether it is necessary to launch a hearing preservation program and additional health protection measures for this specific working population. The method of physical examination and audiometry was used. Thirty-four professional firefighters from Opatija and 30 workers of Rijeka Promet employed at the town parking lots underwent audiometry on a Sibelmed AC 50 device and then analyzed. The results of biauricular audiometry showed significant differences in hearing damage between the firefighters and Rijeka Promet employees at higher frequencies where hearing damage begins, i.e. at 4 kHz and 8 kHz (P &lt; 0.05). The firefighters' maximal hearing loss of 30.58 +/- 24.66 dB for the right ear at 4 kHz and of 28.52 +/- 24.66 dB for the right ear at 8 kHz were higher than the hearing loss of the parking lot employees with maximal hearing loss of 17.00 +/- 13.10 dB at 4 kHz and of 16.33 +/- 13.89 dB at 8 kHz. The results of left ear audiometry were very close to those of right ear in both groups of subjects. The linear regression analysis yielded almost identical positive correlation between the time spent at the job and hearing damage, with correlation factor r = +.55 for the right and left ear at 4 kHz. The noise was measured at the Opatija Fire Station. Several measurements were performed: on the premises where firefighters are exposed to so-called communal noise, measurements at 2 m of the fire truck when sirens are sounded, noise measurements in driver's cab when sirens are sounded, and the noise made by motor water pump used in firefighting. Also, measurements were performed on the spot, i.e. at the working place of parking lot employees in the center of Rijeka where they stay most of the time, and on the street by the parking lot. It may be concluded that noise-induced hearing damage in firefighters is a major problem in this working population, their physical and mental condition being very good, which is to be expected of the groups of operatives on whom the lives of &quot;ordinary&quot; people often depend. Hearing damage is the only weak point of firefighters, although fairly mild to moderate at higher frequencies, so medical experts in cooperation with their chiefs should persuade them to wear hearing protection, which could be discomforting in firefighting operations. Firemen are employed mainly at a young age when their hearing is normal. A parallel may be drawn with the military. Professional soldiers who are physically perfectly fit, at periodical medical examinations are often assessed as &quot;limited service&quot; due to hearing damage, although their hearing was good when they started the career. Hearing in the young population is generally good, in Primorje-Gorski Kotar County the average hearing level is 10 dB at all routine frequencies on audiometry, so hearing damage is not among illnesses that might cause difficulties to young recruits. To conclude, to preserve good hearing in both young and experienced firefighters, the Hearing Preservation Program should be more strictly implemented in the Primorje-Gorski Kotar County."

"19570944","Determinants of use of hearing protection devices in Canadian lumber mill workers.","BACKGROUND: In a cohort study of lumber mill workers' exposure to noise and incidence of heart disease, initial noise estimates were likely overestimated because they did not account for reductions afforded by the use of hearing protection. As such information was seldom available for individual workers, modeling was necessary to predict hearing protection use and derive adjusted noise measures.OBJECTIVE: To develop a multilevel model of the likelihood of use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) for British Columbia (Canada) lumber mill workers.METHOD: The study population included 13,147 workers in 14 sawmills for whom we had information on HPD use. Subjects self-reported their use of hearing protectors during routine hearing tests over their work history period. Separate multilevel logistic regression models with increasing complexity were developed for a subcohort of workers with complete information (n = 1493) and for a subcohort comprised subjects with hearing tests coinciding with their jobs (n = 10 203). The models included random intercepts for worker and for sawmill.RESULTS: HPD use was associated in both subcohorts with factors such as noise exposure and age. We also showed that specific jobs (such as sawfiling) and departments (planer, in particular) were strongly associated with the use of HPDs. The model illustrates the quantitative importance of including a hierarchical structure which allows for explaining potential sources of outcome variability.CONCLUSIONS: We developed a hierarchical model to predict hearing protection use to enable correction of exposure assessments for use in retrospective epidemiological studies. We showed that this was feasible even in the absence of complete determinant information."

This is due to increase in mechanization in industries, transportation as well as home appliances produce high level of noise. Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL) is common health complaint found in industrial workers. The present research work reveals the NIHL problem in workers related to saw mill and printing press in Akluj town, Solapur district of Maharashatra state. For the present study measurement of noise levels are done in saw mills and printing presses. The standard noise level value is calculated in respective locations. Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL) among the workers is measured by an Audiometer. 420 workers, viz. 250 from ten saw mills and 170 from ten printing presses respectively were investigated to find out NIHL. The average noise levels in printing press and saw mill are 90.2 dB and 79.3 dB respectively. Whereas standard noise level (Leq) in above locations are 101.4 dB and 98.7 dB respectively. The average NIHL are found in 28% saw mill workers and 13% in printing press workers. It is reported that medicine treatments are not very useful for curing NIHL. Today's available tool which prevents NIHL is ear plugs and ear muffs, which are suitable for preventing NIHL problems in industrial workers."

Accident risk is elevated for workers with a hearing handicap because of their reduced speech intelligibility and reduced capability to perceive the direction of incoming sound. An audiogram is not a good method for the evaluation of these functions. To reduce accident risk, organisational and personal solutions are needed. For both methods, efficiency must be evaluated through proper risk assessment. Because practical guidelines are not available, this paper presents principles for accident risk evaluation techniques."

With respect to the average time of exposure to aggressive agents, group I was exposed by a significantly higher time. Retrospective study.DISCUSSION: The fact that the right ear was more affected in group II is controversial and should be better investigated in the future, since some studies show that the left ear would be more prone to noise-induced hearing loss.CONCLUSION: group II had proportionally a higher rate of hearing loss when compared with group I, even after having been exposed to aggressive agents for a lower average time."

The participants were interviewed and had their hearing tested in 2005 and 2006.RESULTS: seventy-one percent of the participants were found to have normal hearing. Tinnitus was present in 16% of the males and in 9% of the females. Mean noise exposure length was 7 years and noise levels ranged from 86 to 91 dBA (48%). Bilateral tinnitus (46%) of the hissing type (40%) and moderate intensity (49%) was the most prevalent. Symptoms began to be observed within one to five years after initial exposure to noise (67%) and manifested themselves in weekly episodes (41%) that bothered the patients mostly at night (34%). A significant correlation was observed between the frequency of tinnitus episodes and the noise levels to which workers were exposed.CONCLUSION: tinnitus should be included in hearing loss prevention programs in order to more comprehensively promote occupational hearing health."
"19440420","Sensorineural hearing loss associated with occupational noise exposure: effects of age-corrections.","Noise-induced permanent threshold shifts (NIPTS) were computed from retrospective audiometric analyses by subtracting aging effects on hearing sensitivity in sixty-eight patients with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss who reported significant occupational noise exposure histories. There were significant effects of age on NIPTS but no significant gender- or ear- differences in terms of NIPTS. The NIPTS at 2,000 Hz was found to be significantly greater than NIPTS at frequencies 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz, 4,000 Hz, and 8,000 Hz. Defined noise notches were seen in the audiograms of 38/136 (27%) ears with SNHL. Results support models that suggest interactive effects of aging and noise on sensorineural hearing loss in ears with occupational noise exposure."
"19372647","Temporal processing disorder associated with styrene exposure.","Little evidence exists on the possible adverse effects of styrene on the central part of the auditory system. The present investigation aimed to study the possible association between styrene exposure and temporal processing abilities. Fifty-nine styrene-exposed subjects and 50 nonexposed control subjects were tested. Pure-tone audiometry (125-8000 Hz) and 3 temporal processing tests (gaps-in-noise, frequency pattern test and duration pattern test) were carried out. Significant differences between groups were found for most of the audiometric thresholds for both ears. ANCOVA analysis showed that styrene-exposed subjects had significantly poorer performances on the frequency and duration pattern tests than nonexposed subjects, when including hearing level and age as covariates. The results of the present research study suggest an association between styrene exposure and central auditory dysfunction characterized by a temporal processing disorder."

"19266930","Noise induced hearing loss of forest workers in Turkey.","In this study, a total number of 114 workers who were in 3 different groups in terms of age and work underwent audiometric analysis. In order to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference between the hearing loss levels of the workers who were included in the study, variance analysis was applied with the help of the data obtained as a result of the evaluation. Correlation and regression analysis were applied in order to determine the relations between hearing loss and their age and their time of work. As a result of the variance analysis, statistically significant differences were found at 500, 2000 and 4000 Hz frequencies. The most specific difference was observed among chainsaw machine operators at 4000 Hz frequency, which was determined by the variance analysis. As a result of the correlation analysis, significant relations were found between time of work and hearing loss in 0.01 confidence level and between age and hearing loss in 0.05 confidence level. Forest workers using chainsaw machines should be informed, they should wear or use protective materials and less noising chainsaw machines should be used if possible and workers should undergo audiometric tests when they start work and once a year."
"19265255","Reliability of audiometric thresholds obtained with insert earphones when used by certified audiometric technicians.","Clinical audiologists and audiometric equipment manufacturers have embraced the clinical use of insert earphones; however, their use in audiometric testing in occupational hearing loss prevention programs has been limited. This study was undertaken to research whether certified audiometric technicians without practical hands-on training could reliably use insert earphones when compared to a clinically experienced audiologist. Hearing thresholds were obtained on 60 human ears by six certified audiometric technicians using insert earphones for the first time. Technician-acquired audiometric thresholds were compared to thresholds obtained under the same conditions by a clinical audiologist experienced in the use of the insert earphones. Statistical analyses of audiometric thresholds were performed to investigate the relationships between audiometric threshold values at each frequency obtained by certified technicians vs. the audiologist. These relationships were examined for the group as a whole as well as when ear tip size and earphone insertion depth varied between the audiologist and the technicians. No significant differences (p &gt; .01) were found between mean group thresholds at any of the test frequencies (500-8000 Hz). Mean group thresholds differed by &lt; 1.2 dB. Pearson Product-Moment correlation (PPMC) coefficients suggested that thresholds obtained by the audiometric technician were highly correlated with those obtained by the audiologist. There were no significant threshold differences (p &gt; .01) even when the audiologist and technicians varied in their selection of ear tip size or in the amount of insertion depth achieved. This study suggests that CAOHC-certified audiometric technicians can reliably use insert earphones without practical training when testing in quiet environments by reading the earphone package directions provided by the manufacturer."
"19265247","The hearing conservation amendment: 25 years later.","It has been twenty-five years since the final version of the Hearing Conservation Amendment was issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the U.S. Department of Labor. Since that time, some things have changed and others have stayed exactly the same. Certainly the noise-exposed workforce is more knowledgeable about the hazards of noise, and the use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) has greatly increased. There have been significant strides in the technology for measuring noise and for protecting hearing through HPDs. But there is considerable room for improvement. Some of the noise regulation's provisions are embarrassingly outdated, some are in dire need of improvement, and others, such as the requirements for engineering noise control, are not being enforced. Sadly, there seems to be little progress in reducing overall noise exposure levels. What needs to be done at this point is a major overhaul of the noise regulation: recommitment to engineering noise control; reduction of the permissible exposure limit (PEL) to 85 dBA; a shift to the 3-dBA exchange rate; and a nationwide assessment of hearing loss in American workers to determine the effectiveness of current hearing conservation measures to identify and address the weaknesses in programs and regulations."
"19249881","The prevalence and correlates of hearing loss in drivers in isfahan, iran.","BACKGROUND: There are no data on the prevalence of occupational noise-induced hearing loss in drivers using standard audiometric testing. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and risk factors of occupational noise-induced hearing loss in drivers.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a random sample of 4300 long-distance drivers age &gt; or =20 years taken out of a total of 10,000 estimated professionals in the city of Isfahan, Iran, from February 2006 through March 2007. The drivers were interviewed and underwent clinical and laboratory examinations including measurement of blood pressure, anthropometric data, and pure-tone audiometry in a sound-treated booths. The mean (SD) age of the participants was 40.8 (11.0) years with a mean (SD) duration of professional driving of 14.7 (9.6) years.RESULTS: The prevalence of bilateral noise-induced hearing loss was 18.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 17.0~19.3]. The prevalence rates were higher in the left ear only 6.5% (95% CI: 5.8~7.3) than the right ear only 3.0 percent; (95% CI: 2.5~3.9). Using a stepwise binary logistic regression model for the right and left ear only and for both ears separately, age was a significant independent predictor of bilateral noise-induced hearing loss and for the left or right ear only. When bilateral noise-induced hearing loss was entered in the model, fasting blood glucose was a significant predictor of noise-induced hearing loss. Blood pressure, cholesterol, triglyceride, body mass index, and marital status had no significant independent association with noise-induced hearing loss when other covariates were considered.CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that noise-induced hearing loss among the long-distance drivers appears to be similar to the world's population endures noise-induced hearing loss caused by occupational exposure to noise, with higher prevalence in the left ear only."
"19206875","Detecting incipient inner-ear damage from impulse noise with otoacoustic emissions.","Audiometric thresholds and otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) were measured in 285 U.S. Marine Corps recruits before and three weeks after exposure to impulse-noise sources from weapons' fire and simulated artillery, and in 32 non-noise-exposed controls. At pre-test, audiometric thresholds for all ears were &lt;or=25 dB HL from 0.5 to 3 kHz and &lt;or=30 dB HL at 4 kHz. Ears with low-level or absent OAEs at pre-test were more likely to be classified with significant threshold shifts (STSs) at post-test. A subgroup of 60 noise-exposed volunteers with complete data sets for both ears showed significant decreases in OAE amplitude but no change in audiometric thresholds. STSs and significant emission shifts (SESs) between 2 and 4 kHz in individual ears were identified using criteria based on the standard error of measurement from the control group. There was essentially no association between the occurrence of STS and SES. There were more SESs than STSs, and the group of SES ears had more STS ears than the group of no-SES ears. The increased sensitivity of OAEs in comparison to audiometric thresholds was shown in all analyses, and low-level OAEs indicate an increased risk of future hearing loss by as much as ninefold."

THI results indicated that tinnitus had the greatest influence in the functional scale (54%). Significant correlations (p &lt; .05) were observed between the periodicity of tinnitus and noise exposure level; degree of tinnitus and exposure to chemicals; total THI score and the scores of the catastrophic, emotional, and functional scales; score of the emotional scale and the functional scale; and results of the THI and the general state of health. An evaluation of tinnitus and its impact could benefit tinnitus sufferers in the workplace."
"19194295","Estimation of equivalent noise exposure level using hearing threshold levels of a population.","OBJECTIVES: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is costly in both human and economic terms. One means of reducing NIHL is to apply engineering controls to hazardous noise sources. To trade off the cost of engineering controls against the total direct monetary costs incurred by NIHL, a means of predicting the amount of NIHL that will be incurred over the life-cycle of a hazardous noise source is necessary. A widely known algorithm for the prediction of NIHL is published in ANSI S3.44-1996. However, the algorithm inputs, noise exposure level and duration, may be difficult to determine in some cases. This paper describes the conceptual basis of an approach for using ANSI S3.44-1996 to predict hearing thresholds in a population even when noise exposure levels and durations are not precisely known, and demonstrates the initial application of this approach to a single military population.DESIGN: Retrospective data were obtained on the hearing-threshold levels, demographic characteristics, and noise exposure history of 250 male U.S. Navy machinists' mates. A maximum-likelihood fitting procedure was developed in which the noise level input to the algorithm was varied in order to determine the noise level that best accounted for all of the data.RESULTS: The maximum likelihood fitting produced a value for the noise level input of approximately 93 dBA, with a standard error of approximately 0.3. The low standard error virtually eliminates any estimate above 94 or below 92 dBA, and indicates that a good fit to the data was achieved.CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrates the feasibility of calibrating the algorithm to an individual population, even when noise exposure level or duration is not precisely known. Future work will focus on validating and generalizing this approach so that it may be used to predict hearing-threshold levels in various populations. Such an approach may be used in calculating potential cost savings in compensable hearing loss due to the application of noise control solutions."

Three quarters of them have tinnitus with a frequency corresponding to hearing loss.CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the risk of amplified music on hearing and tinnitus."
"21185251","Assessment of mean auditory hazard incurred by occupational exposure to impulse noise.","OBJECTIVES: To assess the collective hearing hazard entailed by occupational noise exposure.METHODS: The Late Audio-Sonometric Index (LASI) is a global score recommended for following up hearing loss in groups of workers exposed to traumatic noise, combining: daily noise exposure level (L(EX,8h) in dB(A)); individual hearing threshold level at 3 kHz (HTL (3kHz) in dB); HTL(0)(3)(kHz) targeted at retirement; and 5 (or 10) years age bracket between 50 and 59 years of age. LASI=HTL(0)(3kHz) - HTL (3kHz)+10 log (age - 20) - 10 log (0.23×L(EX,8h) - 17.36).RESULTS: When L(EX,8h) exceeds 80dB(A) and HTL(0)(3kHz) is at 25dB, occasional audiometric surveillance may be recommended for workers exposed to hazardous impulse noise: e.g., should the median and the mean LASI values fall below 20 for men or 23 for women (indicative threshold values).CONCLUSION: This exponential model thus integrates the fact that daily exposure to impulse noise may be more harmful for hearing than eight hours exposure to continuous noise of equivalent energy."

In some cases, conventional frequencies are not sensitive enough to pick up early changes to the inner ear.AIM: To analyze the results of threshold high frequency analysis of individuals exposed to noise with normal conventional audiometry.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional cohort study, in which we studied 47 firefighters of the Fire Department of Rio de Janeiro, based on Santos Dumont airport and 33 military men without noise exposure. They were broken down into two age groups: 30-39years and 40-49years. The high frequencies were studied immediately after conventional audiometry.RESULTS: The results were most significant in the 40 to 49 years of age range, where the experimental group showed significantly higher threshold values than the control group 14000Hz (p = 0.008) and 16,000Hz (p = 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that noise interfered with high frequency thresholds, where all the mean values found in the experimental group were higher than those in the control group. We suggest that these data reinforce the importance of studying high frequencies, even with normal conventional audiometry in the early detection of noise-induced hearing loss."
"21173487","Noise sensitivity and hearing disability.","The aim of this study was to investigate the association of noise sensitivity with self-reported hearing disability and hearing levels, with consideration of the role of self-reported history of noise exposure and use of hearing protectors. The study is based on the Finnish Twin Cohort. In 1988, a noise questionnaire was sent to 1005 twin pairs, 1495 individuals (688 men, 807 women) replied. The age range was 31-88 years. Information on some potential confounders was obtained from the questionnaire in 1981 for the same individuals. A subsample of thirty-eight elderly women with noise sensitivity response from 1988 had audiometry data from 2000 to 2001. Noise sensitivity was associated with self-reported hearing disability among all subjects [odds ratio (OR) 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-2.12] and among women (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.19-3.04), but no-more significantly among men (OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.86-1.98). The association was primarily seen among younger subjects (50 years or less). The difference between noise sensitive and non-noise sensitive elderly women in the average of thresholds at frequencies of 0.5-4 kHz in the better ear was not significant (Pr = 0.18). Noise sensitivity did not modify the association of hearing disability with the self-reported history of occupational noise exposure. Noise sensitivity was associated with the use of hearing protectors at work. The study shows the importance of recognizing the noise sensitive in noise effect studies, since sensitivity in annoyance has implications in most of the effect categories."
"21173486","Hearing loss among classical-orchestra musicians.","This study intended to evaluate classical musicians' risk of hearing loss. We studied 63 musicians from four Helsinki classical orchestras. We measured their hearing loss with an audiometer, found their prior amount of exposure to sound and some individual susceptibility factors with a questionnaire, measured their present sound exposure with dosimeters, and tested their blood pressure and cholesterol levels, then compared their hearing loss to ISO 1999-1990's predictions. The musicians' hearing loss distribution corresponded to that of the general population, but highly exposed musicians had greater hearing loss at frequencies over 3 kHz than less-exposed ones. Their individual susceptibility factors were low. Music deteriorates hearing, but by less than what ISO 1999-1990 predicted. The low number of individual susceptibility factors explained the difference, but only reduced hearing loss and not the prevalence of tinnitus."
"21091403","A multi-component intervention to promote hearing protector use among construction workers.","Hearing protection devices (HPD) remain a primary method of prevention of noise-induced hearing loss despite their well-known limitations. A three-pronged intervention to increase HPD use was conducted among construction workers and included a baseline hearing loss prevention training, follow-up 'toolbox' (TB) reinforcement trainings, and use of a personal noise level indicator (NLI). A total of 176 subjects on eight sites completed three assessments. Prior to intervention, HPDs were used an average of 34.5% of the time and increased significantly, up about 12.1% after intervention and 7.5% two months after interventions were completed. The increase in HPD use was greatest among the group receiving both TB and NLI interventions; up about 25% from baseline, and this group was about two times more likely to use HPDs than the BL (baseline) training only group. This study demonstrates the mild impact of a well-constructed HPD use training and provides support for the additional use of a personal NLI to increase use of HPDs among construction workers. The most effective procedures for using such instruments require further exploration."
"21059594","Use of historical data and a novel metric in the evaluation of the effectiveness of hearing conservation program components.","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of hearing conservation programs (HCP) and their specific components in reducing noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at one food-processing plant and two automotive plants. Audiometric and work-history databases were combined with historical noise monitoring data to develop a time-dependent exposure matrix for each plant. Historical changes in production and HCP implementation were collected from company records, employee interviews and focus groups. These data were used to develop time-dependent quality assessments for various HCP components. 5478 male (30,427 observations) and 1005 female (5816 observations) subjects were included in the analysis.RESULTS: Analyses were conducted separately for males and females. Females tended to have less NIHL at given exposure levels than males. Duration of noise exposure stratified by intensity (dBA) was a better predictor of NIHL than the standard equivalent continuous noise level (L(eq)) based upon a 3-dBA exchange. Within this cohort, efficient dBA strata for males were &lt;95 versus = 95, and for females &lt;90 versus = 90. The reported enforced use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) significantly reduced NIHL. The data did not have sufficient within-plant variation to determine the effectiveness of noise monitoring or worker training. An association between increased audiometric testing and NIHL was believed to be an artifact of increased participation in screening.CONCLUSIONS: Historical audiometric data combined with noise monitoring data can be used to better understand the effectiveness of HCPs. Regular collection and maintenance of quality data should be encouraged and used to monitor the effectiveness of these interventions."

After audiological evaluation (pure tone audiometry, middle ear analysis, TEOAE and DPOAE) hearing protective devices were provided to be used for three months. After that musicians answered a satisfaction assessment questionnaire.RESULTS: The prevalence of hearing loss was of 21.7%. The most common complaints about the hearing protectors were: autophonia, pressure in the ears, interference in high frequencies perception and full time use of the hearing protector during concerts. There was a positive correlation between a reduction in tinnitus after the use of the HPD with the following complaints: tinnitus after beginning the career (p= 0.044), discomfort with the sound intensity in the work place (p= 0.009) and intolerance to loud sound (p= 0.029).CONCLUSIONS: There was a high prevalence of hearing loss and a positive tendency towards the use of the ear protector device among the sample population."

"20831461","Comparing health care use and related costs between groups with and without hearing impairment.","This study aims to compare the use (and related costs) of different health care resources between groups of normally-hearing and hearing-impaired people. A distinction was made between hearing-related and other health care contacts. Data were collected at the baseline measurement of the national longitudinal study on hearing, and at each month during a subsequent period of six months. Hearing status was determined using an internet speech-in-noise test. The sample comprised 1295 normally-hearing and hearing-impaired subjects, aged 18-65 years. Adjusting for confounders, regression models showed that hearing-impaired respondents had significantly more contacts and higher costs for primary, secondary, and occupational care than normally-hearing respondents during the period under investigation. The differences were due to a larger number of health care contacts for which hearing impairment was the main motive to seek help. After excluding these contacts, the differences in health care use and costs between the groups were not significant. This suggests that besides hearing-related contacts, adults with hearing impairment do not make more use of health care resources than adults without hearing difficulties."
"20828512","Predicting hearing thresholds and occupational hearing loss with multiple-frequency auditory steady-state responses.","OBJECTIVE: An objective investigation is needed to verify the existence and severity of hearing impairments resulting from work-related, noise-induced hearing loss in arbitration of medicolegal aspects. We investigated the accuracy of multiple-frequency auditory steady-state responses (Mf-ASSRs) between subjects with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) with and without occupational noise exposure.DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.SETTING: Tertiary referral medical centre.METHODS: Pure-tone audiometry and Mf-ASSRs were recorded in 88 subjects (34 patients had occupational noise-induced hearing loss [NIHL], 36 patients had SNHL without noise exposure, and 18 volunteers were normal controls).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Inter- and intragroup comparisons were made. A predicting equation was derived using multiple linear regression analysis.RESULTS: ASSRs and pure-tone thresholds (PTTs) showed a strong correlation for all subjects (r = .77  .94). The relationship is demonstrated by the equationThe differences between the ASSR and PTT were significantly higher for the NIHL group than for the subjects with non-noise-induced SNHL (p &lt; .001).CONCLUSIONS: Mf-ASSR is a promising tool for objectively evaluating hearing thresholds. Predictive value may be lower in subjects with occupational hearing loss. Regardless of carrier frequencies, the severity of hearing loss affects the steady-state response. Moreover, the ASSR may assist in detecting noise-induced injury of the auditory pathway. A multiple linear regression equation to accurately predict thresholds was shown that takes into consideration all effect factors."

The project, which started in 2008, is promoted by EBITRAL (trade unions and business joint association) and carried out by Occupational Medicine Department of Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo. The final objective is to improve health conditions of truck drivers, by defining appropriate health surveillance protocols in order to asses fitness for work and by promoting the application of healthy life-styles among the workers. The first step required the collection of bio-statistical data, in order to analyze prevalence and incidence of work-related diseases in the future.METHODS: In the first year, 226 truck drivers (mean age 42. 7years, SD 9.5; mean working seniority 26.8 years, SD 10.6) were evaluated via application of an experimental survey protocol: medical examination, questionnaires for the main risks (low back pain, alcohol and drug consumption, sleepiness, etc), instrumental and laboratory tests (ECG, eye test, audiometric test, blood test, urinary drugs test).RESULTS: We observed 11 work-related diseases: 8 cases of hearing loss caused by chronic exposure to noise and 3 cases of low back disk disease. In 22 cases (9.7%) it was necessary to apply some restrictions to the truck drivers' fitness for work, first of all because of cardiovascular diseases and musculoskeletal disorders. We also found 3 subjects with positive urinary drug test: 1 for cocaine, 1 for methadone, 1 for cannabis. With the application of the experimental survey protocol many unknown diseases were also diagnosed (cardiovascular diseases, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, etc), which could have played a role in increasing accident risk or, without an appropriate therapy, in reducing workers' future fitness for work.DISCUSSION: This first year of experience made it possible to collect bio-statistical data on truck drivers' work-related diseases. As regards fitness for work, we observed that drug consumption is not the most relevant health problem to consider in order to improve truck drivers' safety and citizens' safety on the road."

Audiometry was offered and 169 of the 191 workers assessed for HAVS agreed to have the audiometric test. The objective was to examine the prevalence of hearing loss in these 169 workers and to determine the effect on hearing of duration of work in construction (as a proxy for noise exposure) and the severity of vibration white finger (VWF) which previous studies have suggested is a marker for increased individual susceptibility for NIHL. VWF was measured by the Stockholm vascular scale.RESULTS: All participants were men, median age of 57 (range: 28-75), median number of years worked in construction of 35 (range: 4-52). All of the Spearman rank correlations between years worked in construction and the hearing levels at each audiometric frequency were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). Overall, 31 (18.3%) participants had hearing loss at or above the level at which a workers' compensation pension would be granted in Ontario and the prevalence of this auditory outcome had a statistically significant increase as years worked in construction increased. Multivariate linear regression indicated that VWF also had a statistically significant effect on hearing loss for all audiometric frequencies combined after controlling for years worked in construction.CONCLUSION: Improved prevention of hearing loss in construction workers is needed."
"20719782","Constrained inference in mixed-effects models for longitudinal data with application to hearing loss.","In medical studies, endpoints are often measured for each patient longitudinally. The mixed-effects model has been a useful tool for the analysis of such data. There are situations in which the parameters of the model are subject to some restrictions or constraints. For example, in hearing loss studies, we expect hearing to deteriorate with time. This means that hearing thresholds which reflect hearing acuity will, on average, increase over time. Therefore, the regression coefficients associated with the mean effect of time on hearing ability will be constrained. Such constraints should be accounted for in the analysis. We propose maximum likelihood estimation procedures, based on the expectation-conditional maximization either algorithm, to estimate the parameters of the model while accounting for the constraints on them. The proposed methods improve, in terms of mean square error, on the unconstrained estimators. In some settings, the improvement may be substantial. Hypotheses testing procedures that incorporate the constraints are developed. Specifically, likelihood ratio, Wald, and score tests are proposed and investigated. Their empirical significance levels and power are studied using simulations. It is shown that incorporating the constraints improves the mean squared error of the estimates and the power of the tests. These improvements may be substantial. The methodology is used to analyze a hearing loss study."
"20689029","Listening habits of iPod users.","PURPOSE: To estimate real-environment iPod listening levels for listeners in 4 environments to gain insight into whether average listeners receive dosages exceeding occupational noise exposure guidelines as a result of their listening habits.METHOD: The earbud outputs of iPods were connected directly into the inputs of a digital recorder to make recordings of listening levels. These recordings were used to estimate listening levels using reference recordings made in a real ear. Recordings were made in 4 environments with a wide range of background noises: (a) a library, (b) a student center, (c) busy streets, and (d) the subway.RESULTS: None of the 64 listeners were estimated to exceed allowable occupational dosages, with a maximum dose of 7.57% based on Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA; 1998) methods and 10.83% based on National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH; 1998) methods.CONCLUSIONS: All of the listeners surveyed were exposed to dosages well below OSHA and NIOSH occupational regulations. Although this does not guarantee individual safety, the results do not support the widespread concern regarding the safety of common iPod usage. However, measurements made in this study agree with the finding that iPod output can exceed safe levels and further support recommendations to monitor and limit listening volume and listening duration."
"20670725","Prevalence and characteristics of tinnitus among US adults.","BACKGROUND: Tinnitus is common; however, few risk factors for tinnitus are known.METHODS: We examined cross-sectional relations between several potential risk factors and self-reported tinnitus in 14,178 participants in the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, a nationally representative database. We calculated the prevalence of any and frequent (at least daily) tinnitus in the overall US population and among subgroups. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) after adjusting for multiple potential confounders.RESULTS: Approximately 50 million US adults reported having any tinnitus, and 16 million US adults reported having frequent tinnitus in the past year. The prevalence of frequent tinnitus increased with increasing age, peaking at 14.3% between 60 and 69 years of age. Non-Hispanic whites had higher odds of frequent tinnitus compared with other racial/ethnic groups. Hypertension and former smoking were associated with an increase in odds of frequent tinnitus. Loud leisure-time, firearm, and occupational noise exposure also were associated with increased odds of frequent tinnitus. Among participants who had an audiogram, frequent tinnitus was associated with low-mid frequency (OR 2.37; 95% CI, 1.76-3.21) and high frequency (OR 3.00; 95% CI, 1.78-5.04) hearing impairment. Among participants who were tested for mental health conditions, frequent tinnitus was associated with generalized anxiety disorder (OR 6.07; 95% CI, 2.33-15.78) but not major depressive disorder (OR 1.58; 95% CI, 0.54-4.62).CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of frequent tinnitus is highest among older adults, non-Hispanic whites, former smokers, and adults with hypertension, hearing impairment, loud noise exposure, or generalized anxiety disorder. Prospective studies of risk factors for tinnitus are needed."

"20593381","Hearing impairment in F-111 maintenance workers: the study of health outcomes in aircraft maintenance personnel (SHOAMP) general health and medical study.","BACKGROUND: We sought to examine hearing loss in a group from the Royal Australian Air Force who undertook fuel tank maintenance on F-111 aircraft, with exposure to formulations containing ototoxins, relative to two different comparison groups.METHODS: Using pure-tone audiometry, hearing thresholds were assessed in 614 exposed personnel, 513 technical-trade comparisons (different base, same job), and 403 non-technical comparisons (same base, different job). We calculated percentage loss of hearing (PLH) and used regression models to examine whether there was an association between PLH and F-111 fuel tank maintenance, adjusting for possible confounders. In addition, the difference between the observed hearing thresholds and the expected thresholds based on an otologically normal population (ISO-7029-2003) was determined.RESULTS: The PLH ranged from nil to 96 (median 1.5, quartiles 0.3, 5.5). A logistic regression model showed no statistically significant difference in PLH among the three exposure groups (exposed vs. non-technical controls 1.1: 95% CI 0.7, 2.0 and exposed vs. technical OR 0.9: 95% CI 0.6, 1.3). The model also highlighted a number of other risk factors for PLH including age, tinnitus, smoking, depression, and use of depression medications. However, at all eight frequencies measured, all populations had lower than expected hearing thresholds based on published ISO-7029 medians.CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no difference in PLH between the three exposure groups, the study did reveal a high degree of hearing loss between the 3 groups and a normal population."
"20588120","Application of the kurtosis statistic to the evaluation of the risk of hearing loss in workers exposed to high-level complex noise.","OBJECTIVE: Develop dose-response relations for two groups of industrial workers exposed to Gaussian or non-Gaussian (complex) types of continuous noises and to investigate what role, if any, the kurtosis statistic can play in the evaluation of industrial noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).DESIGN: Audiometric and noise exposure data were acquired on a population (N = 195) of screened workers from a textile manufacturing plant and a metal fabrication facility located in Henan province of China. Thirty-two of the subjects were exposed to non-Gaussian (non-G) noise and 163 were exposed to a Gaussian (G) continuous noise. Each subject was given a general physical and an otologic examination. Hearing threshold levels (0.5-8.0 kHz) were age adjusted (ISI-1999) and the prevalence of NIHL at 3, 4, or 6 kHz was determined. The kurtosis metric, which is sensitive to the peak and temporal characteristics of a noise, was introduced into the calculation of the cumulative noise exposure metric. Using the prevalence of hearing loss and the cumulative noise exposure metric, a dose-response relation for the G and non-G noise-exposed groups was constructed.RESULTS: An analysis of the noise environments in the two plants showed that the noise exposures in the textile plant were of a Gaussian type with an Leq(A)8hr that varied from 96 to 105 dB whereas the exposures in the metal fabrication facility with an Leq(A)8hr = 95 dB were of a non-G type containing high levels (up to 125 dB peak SPL) of impact noise. The kurtosis statistic was used to quantify the deviation of the non-G noise environment from the Gaussian. The dose-response relation for the non-G noise-exposed subjects showed a higher prevalence of hearing loss for a comparable cumulative noise exposure than did the G noise-exposed subjects. By introducing the kurtosis variable into the temporal component of the cumulative noise exposure calculation, the two dose-response curves could be made to overlap, essentially yielding an equivalent noise-induced effect for the two study groups.CONCLUSIONS: For the same exposure level, the prevalence of NIHL is greater in workers exposed to non-G noise environments than for workers exposed to G noise. The kurtosis metric may be a reasonable candidate for use in modifying exposure level calculations that are used to estimate the risk of NIHL from any type of noise exposure environment. However, studies involving a large number of workers with well-documented exposures are needed before a relation between a metric such as the kurtosis and the risk of hearing loss can be refined."
"20584863","Temporary threshold shifts at 1500 and 2000 Hz induced by loud voice signals communicated through earphones in the pinball industry.","To assess the risk of hearing loss among workers using earphones as communication devices at noisy worksites, we compared temporary threshold shifts (TTS) between ears on which workers wore earphones and ears on which no earphones were worn. We measured ambient noise and personal noise exposure as well as noise generated by and passed through earphones by applying frequency analysis at three pinball facilities during their hours of actual operation. We assessed hearing levels before and after a work shift (prework and postwork) of 54 workers by pure tone audiometry at six frequencies. The time-weighted averages for ambient noise and personal noise exposure exceeded 85 dB(A) and 90 dB(A), respectively. Overall sound pressure levels generated by and passing through earphones reached 109 dB(A). The one-third octave band spectrum of the earphone noise during the shift exceeded 90 dB(SPL) in the range of 315-2000 Hz. The number of ears demonstrating a TTS, defined as a shift of 10 dB or more in postwork over prework hearing thresholds, was significantly greater at 1500 and 2000 Hz among ears with earphones (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively) compared to those without. The reverse was observed at 4000 Hz for ears without earphones (P &lt; 0.01). Workers wearing earphones or headsets as communication devices in noisy environments are exposed to high risk of hearing loss, particularly at the frequencies of 1500 and 2000 Hz. Ideally, hearing conservation programs for such workers should account for potential hearing losses at frequencies of 2000 Hz or lower frequencies induced by amplified voice signals."
"20581779","Screening protocols for the prevention of occupational noise-induced hearing loss: the role of conventional and extended high frequency audiometry may vary according to the years of employment.","BACKGROUND: Although occupational noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) has become a major problem in industrialized societies, there is a notable lack of effective screening protocols to ensure its early diagnosis. The aim of this study was to detect a potential role of extended high frequency (EHF) audiometry in industrial hearing screening protocols.METHODS: The population consisted of 151 persons, working for 8 hours daily in a noisy environment (90-110 dBA). The changes of hearing thresholds in industrial workers were analyzed, not only with respect to their age, as has been presented by previous studies, but also with respect to the duration of their previous employment.RESULTS: During the first 10 years of employment, the frequencies 12500, 14000 and 16000Hz were the only ones significantly affected. For the second decade of employment, thresholds were significantly elevated only at 2000 and 4000Hz. After exceeding 20 years of employment, the affected frequencies were 250, 500 and 1000Hz. The effects of age on hearing acuity were significant at all frequencies for the first 2 groups.CONCLUSIONS: EHF audiometry seems able to identify the first signs of NIHL, much earlier than conventional audiometry, and therefore may need to be implemented in the screening examinations especially of workers with less than 1 decade of employment. Hearing screening protocols could become more efficient by adjusting their frequency ranges according to the frequencies &quot;at risk&quot;, which correspond to the duration of the workers' previous employment."
"20516680","The Annex C fallacy: why unscreened databases are usually preferable for comparison of industrially exposed groups.","One can study occupational noise exposure by comparing hearing thresholds of exposed people to control data from national or international standards. ANSI S3.44 (1996) offers Annex C--thresholds for people without occupational noise exposure--as appropriate control data for such comparisons. Annex C is based on the false assumption that people who have had occupational noise exposure are similar in all other important ways to those without such exposures. In fact, people with noisy jobs are more likely than others to be smokers, diabetics, poorly educated, white and exposed to non-occupational noise. Taking these other risk factors into account, the appropriate thresholds for comparison to industrial study populations are closer to those of the unscreened population than to an 'Annex C' population that simply excludes occupationally noise-exposed persons."
"23111896","Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for acute noise-induced hearing loss: evaluation of different treatment regimens.","INTRODUCTION: Impulse noise from firearms is a common cause of acute acoustic trauma (AAT), which is characterized by high-frequency hearing loss and tinnitus. Various treatment modalities have been proposed, some combining medical treatment with hyperbaric oxygen (HBOT) in various ways. We have reviewed the therapeutic effect of primary protocols, with or without HBOT, used in our hospital.METHODS: Sixty-eight soldiers for all of whom pre-AAT audiometry tests were available, were treated with one of three different regimens. Group 1 received oral medication only. Group 2 received HBOT twice a day for 3 days then once a day (7 days), combined with intravenous medication (5 days) followed by oral treatment. Group 3 received HBOT once a day and oral medication for 10 days. Medical treatment consisted of methylprednisolone and piracetam in all groups. Control audiometry was performed after 10 days. Average Hearing Gain (AHG) and Average Residual Hearing Loss (ARHL) were calculated.RESULTS: The mean AHG in Group 1 was +5.58 ± 3.58 dB (mean ± SD); in Group 2 it was +20.62 ± 17.68 dB; and in Group 3 +17.0 ± 14.0 dB (P = 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test). The mean ARHL without HBOT was -14.7 ± 8.27 dB (Group 1), and respectively -2.36 ± 10.69 dB (Group 2) and -5.0 ± 8.0 dB (Group 3) in the HBOT groups (P = 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test).CONCLUSION: These results indicate a significant benefit for the combination of HBOT and medical therapy over medical treatment alone. Which of the two HBOT regimens is the more effective, remains to be determined."
"20430548","The impact of arterial sclerosis on hearing with and without occupational noise exposure: a population-based aging study in males.","OBJECTIVES: Arterial sclerosis contributes to inadequate blood supply to multiple organs, suggesting that general atherosclerosis may play an important role in the inner ear. Since noise is a major etiology for hearing loss, the aim of this study was to evaluate both the respective and the combined effects of arterial sclerosis and occupational noise exposure on hearing after accounting for age in middle-aged and elderly men.METHODS: The evaluation was conducted using 773 subjects from a population-based sample of 1189 men, aged 40-83 years. The impact of carotid atherosclerosis (CA) or retinal arteriolosclerosis (RA) on hearing was assessed according to history of occupational noise exposure (Noise) obtained in a questionnaire. Differences in the mean pure-tone thresholds at each frequency, between the CA (+) and CA (-) groups or between the RA (+) and RA (-) groups, based on noise exposure were compared using the general linear model (GLM) Procedure in SAS, with adjustments for age. Then, the main effect of CA or RA, and the interactive effect of noise and either CA or RA on pure-tone threshold at seven frequencies were analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), after adjusting for age.RESULTS: In the Noise (+) group, a statistically significant deterioration in hearing was found in the CA (+) group compared with the CA (-) group at 500 and 1000 Hz. The results in RA were significant at even lower frequencies than in CA. In the results from ANCOVA, the significant main effect of CA was shown in the pure-tone threshold at 8000 Hz, but not in the analysis of RA. A significant interactive effect of either CA or RA and Noise was observed in hearing at the range from 125 to 1000 Hz.CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that the impact of arterial sclerosis on hearing is limited but significantly hazardous in middle-aged and elderly men, and that arterial sclerosis exacerbates the deleterious effects of noise on hearing. Early recognition of arterial sclerosis might be contributory to the hearing prognosis after middle age, especially for noise-exposed men."
"20395587","Estimating adolescent risk for hearing loss based on data from a large school-based survey.","OBJECTIVES: We estimated whether and to what extent a group of adolescents were at risk of developing permanent hearing loss as a result of voluntary exposure to high-volume music, and we assessed whether such exposure was associated with hearing-related symptoms.METHODS: In 2007, 1512 adolescents (aged 12-19 years) in Dutch secondary schools completed questionnaires about their music-listening behavior and whether they experienced hearing-related symptoms after listening to high-volume music. We used their self-reported data in conjunction with published average sound levels of music players, discotheques, and pop concerts to estimate their noise exposure, and we compared that exposure to our own &quot;loosened&quot; (i.e., less strict) version of current European safety standards for occupational noise exposure.RESULTS: About half of the adolescents exceeded safety standards for occupational noise exposure. About one third of the respondents exceeded safety standards solely as a result of listening to MP3 players. Hearing symptoms that occurred after using an MP3 player or going to a discotheque were associated with exposure to high-volume music.CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents often exceeded current occupational safety standards for noise exposure, highlighting the need for specific safety standards for leisure-time noise exposure."
"20361699","[Comparative analysis of audiometric and impedancemetric findings in workers exposed to the effects of various duration industrial noise].","AIM: Industrial noise is produced in workshops due to factory machinery and tools used in technological processes. It has detrimental effect to primarily the organ of the sense of hearing, thus damaging hearing in oversensitive subjects. The aim of the study was to perform a detailed analysis of audiometric and, especially, impedancemetric parameters in workers exposed to the effects of industrial noise of various duration, as well as to determine similarities and differences in workers with differences in sensitivity to damaging effects of noise.METHODS: The study included a homogenous group of 173 industrial workers involved in the same department of a huge workshop named &quot;Kovacica&quot; exposed to noise level above a threshold intensity, and divided into three groups: the group I of 116 workers (232 ears) exposed to noise for 8 h in the workshop &quot;Kovacica&quot;, the group II of 41 workers (82 ears) exposed to noise only half of the working time, and the group III of 16 workers (32 ears) exposed to the same conditions and having the normal hearing sense. The group III served as a control group. Prior to the study any workers went through a thorough anamnesis and complete ORL examination, and then they were submitted to audiometric testing. The study included only the workers with no hearing damage due to diseases, injuries nor other detrimental factors in order to be sure that the hearing findings had been caused by industrial noise.RESULTS: The results obtained by audiometric testing showed that 90.75% of the workers had hearing damage of various degrees, while 9.25% of the workers had regular hearing although had been exposed to the same conditions. More severe hearing damage was revealed in the workers of the group I. Tympanometricly, in most ears of the group I workers (65.52%) a compliance value was found to be more than 0.9 cm3, while in the majority of those of the group II (59.75%) a compliance value was in the range from 0.5 to 0.9 cm3. In the workers of the group III with no hearing damage, a compliance value for any ears was in the range from 0.1 to 0.9 cm3. Mean value of threshold reflex (98.56 dB) at 500 Hz and 1 000 Hz in the group I was increased as compared with the group II (95.6 dB) and the group III (84.38 dB). At higher frequences, 2 000 and 4 000 Hz, threshold reflex was increased in the group I (99.05 dB), and in the group II (97.6 dB) as compared with the group III (86.4 dB). The amplitude of stapedic reflex was lowest in the group I, while mean values of amplitude at 500, 1 000, 2 000 and at 4 000 Hz were 2.31, 1.38, 1 and 0.3, respectively. In the group II mean values of amplitude at 500, 1 000, 2 000 and 4 000 Hz were 2.52, 1.80, 1.30 and 0.5, respectively. In the group III mean values of amplitude at 500, 1 000, 2 000 and at 4 000 Hz were 2.36, 2.45, 2.5 and 2.08, respectively. By measuring input (rising) and output angles it was revealed that most ears of the workers in the groups I and II had rising angle ranging from 41 to 50 degrees, and in the workers with no hearing loss from 31 to 50 degrees. In the majority of the ears of the groups I and II outlet angle was in the range from 16 to 35 degrees, and in the workers with no hearing damage from 26 to 35 degrees.CONCLUSION: By audiometric and impedancemetric examinations it was determined that for the sense of hearing it is significant not only a threshold hearing expressed in the audiometric curve at various frequences, but also a threshold of unpleasantness and pain under higher intensities shown by the occurrence of stapedic reflex. The less hearing field between threshold hearing and threshold acustic reflex is, the less capabilities of hearing perception due to the occurrence of recrutment."

"20237208","An investigation of the adjustment of retrospective noise exposure for use of hearing protection devices.","OBJECTIVE: To account for use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) in retrospective noise exposure assessment, adjust noise exposure estimates accordingly, and validate the adjusted estimates.BACKGROUND: A previous study in the same working population showed a stronger relation for noise and acute myocardial infarction among those who did not wear HPD. Because accurate noise exposure assessment is complicated by the use of HPD, we previously developed a multilevel model of the likelihood of HPD use for British Columbia (Canada) lumber mill workers. Historical estimates of noise exposure can be adjusted according to models predictions and a reduction in misclassifying workers, exposure is expected.METHODS: Work history and exposure information were obtained for 13,147 lumber mill workers followed from 1909 until 1998. Audiometric data for the cohort, including hearing threshold levels at several pure tone frequencies, were obtained from the local regulatory agency for the period from 1978 to 2003. Following the modeling of HPD use, noise estimates were adjusted according to models predictions and attenuation factors based on existing research and standards. Adjusted and unadjusted noise metrics were compared by investigating their ability to predict noise-induced hearing loss.RESULTS: We showed a 4-fold increase in the noise exposure and hearing loss slope, after adjusting for HPD use, while controlling for gender, age, race, as well as medical and non-occupational confounding variables.CONCLUSION: While the relative difference before and after adjustment for use of HPD is considerable, we observed a subtle absolute magnitude of the effect. Using noise-induced hearing loss as a 'gold standard' for testing the assessment of retrospective noise exposure estimates should continue to be investigated."
"20233141","Prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss in student musicians.","This study describes the prevalence and characteristics of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in student musicians (N = 329) aged 18-25 years. Students completed a questionnaire regarding exposures before a hearing assessment. NIHL was defined by the presence of a notch 15 dB in depth at 4000 or 6000 Hz relative to the best preceding threshold. Overall prevalence of NIHL was 45%, with 78% of notches occurring at 6000 Hz. The proportion of the total population with bilateral notching at any frequency was 11.5%, mostly occurring at 6000 Hz. There was a significant increase in the frequency of notching in students who reported more than two hours per day of personal practice. There were no significant associations for instrument group or other noise exposures. The data suggest that susceptibility to NIHL among students of music is not uniform and cannot be ascribed solely to the instrument played and other exposures. Students with bilateral losses tend to have deeper notches and may represent a group that has an inherent predisposition to NIHL."
"20218750","Improving hearing health for farming families.","INTRODUCTION: Occupational noise injury and hearing loss are common features of agricultural workforces internationally. Farmsafe Australia has identified hearing health as one of its 4 key priority goals and targets. Currently, approximately 60-70% of Australian farmers have measurable hearing loss, compared with 27% of those in the general Australian community. This article describes the findings of a community based demonstration project to address hearing health issues conducted in the Australian state of New South Wales. This program sought to implement local demonstration projects in 3 communities to identify what works well in hearing health promotion with farmers and what could be applied more broadly throughout Australia.METHODS: Local advisory groups were established in each community to guide project development and implementation. Project implementation focused on 3 major aspects: (1) increasing awareness of priority noise injury prevention and hearing health practices; (2) improving access to hearing health services; and (3) networking services in local communities. Area-specific training was undertaken for stakeholders to maximize local information links. Service utilization data were monitored and analysed.RESULTS: There was variability among sites; however in general there was an increased awareness of hearing health issues by farming families and expanded opportunities for farmers to access screening services. Utilization rates of hearing services also increased markedly in one community. Local hearing health networks were strengthened by linkages to key stakeholders outside the health sector. Previously unidentified methods of promoting hearing health (eg using agricultural retail outlets that supply hearing protection equipment and are accepted by farmers as an information source) were identified and utilized.CONCLUSIONS: Hearing health promotion with farmers in local communities can be enhanced through utilization and strengthening of local networks. Integration of hearing health initiatives with other agencies already working with farming families will be important in developing and enhancing long-term sustainable outcomes. Continued work at a national level to assist in stimulating local action will be required to build on the potential gains in reducing noise injury in the farming community."

A total of 839 men, 19-22 years old, were recruited for the study when reporting for primary military service. A questionnaire was distributed and audiometry was performed. The prevalence of tinnitus, sensitivity to noise, and measured hearing impairment in the study group was 23.2%, 15.5%, and 14.5% respectively. Exposure to occupational noise often was reported by 21.4%, and playing loud music often by 16.5%. The young men who had experienced tinnitus after noise exposure had an elevated risk of high frequency hearing impairment, tinnitus, and sensitivity to noise. Those who played loud music had elevated prevalence values of tinnitus but not of hearing impairment. In this young group we observed high prevalence values of ototraumatic factors and auditory symptoms. We also observed significant correlations between tinnitus after noise exposure, self-assessed hearing symptoms, and hearing impairment."
"20192875","Otoacoustic emissions in a hearing conservation program: general applicability in longitudinal monitoring and the relation to changes in pure-tone thresholds.","The hearing status of workers (N = 233) in a printing office was assessed twice within seventeen months by pure-tone audiometry and otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). One of the questions was how a quality criterion of OAE-measurements based on a minimum signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) would affect the applicability on the entire population. Secondly, effects of noise exposure were investigated in overall changes in audiogram and OAE-measurements. For TEOAEs (transient evoked OAEs) in the frequency band of 4 kHz, only 55% of the data points meet the SNR-inclusion criterion. For DPOAEs (distortion product OAEs) around 6 kHz approximately 80% of the data points satisfy the criterion. Thus OAEs have a limited applicability for monitoring the hearing status of this entire population. Audiometry shows significant deteriorations at 6 and 8 kHz. TEOAEs show a significant decline at all frequency bands (1-4 kHz), DPOAEs between 4 and 8 kHz and less pronounced between 1 and 2 kHz. On group level, OAEs show a decline in a larger frequency region than the audiogram, suggesting an increased sensitivity of OAEs compared to audiometry."

This study was performed to compare the results of audiogram and the newer diagnostic method distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) parameters due to acoustic shock injury in call center professionals working in a noisy environment and prone to acoustic injury.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hearing functions of 340 subjects were first assessed with pure tone audiometry and then DPOAEs results were compared among acoustic shock exposed subjects with normal audiogram and those with abnormal audiogram.RESULTS: Out of 340 acoustic shock exposed subjects 304 were normal on audiometric testing and 34 had abnormal audiograms. Subsequently on DPOAE testing out of 304 acoustic shock exposed subjects with normal audiogram 125 failed and 181 passed.CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that DPOAEs are more sensitive than audiometry to detect pre-symptomatic inner ear damage. It may play a role as screening and monitoring test for acoustic shock-exposed workers."
"20160390","Noise induced hearing loss risk assessment in truck drivers.","Hearing sense is one of the key elements which may have impact on the driver's task quality. This cross-sectional study investigates the hearing status of 500 truck drivers by pure tone audiometry (AC) in one of the cities in Fars province, Iran. Hearing threshold levels of the subjects were measured in frequencies of 500Hz-8000Hz. Screening and determination of permanent threshold shift (PTS) was the first aim of this study. Hence tests were done at least 16 hours after any exposure to noticeable sound. The effect of age as a confounding factor was considered using ISO equation and subtracted from whole hearing threshold. The threshold of 25 dB HL and above was considered abnormal but the calculation of hearing was also carried out using 0 dB HL as reference. Subjects were categorized into two groups on the basis of working experience and the hearing threshold of 25 dB was considered a boundary of normal hearing sense. The results of Pearson Chi-Square test showed that working experience as an independent variable has significant contributing effect on hearing thresholds of truck drivers in frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz (p greater than 0.05). Also, it was shown that currently nine and 12.6 % of truck drivers suffer from impaired hearing sense in left and right respectively (hearing threshold level greater than 25 dB) in mid frequencies (500, 1000, 2000 Hz) and 45% in high frequencies of both ears (4000 and 8000 Hz). The results indicated that hearing damage of professional drivers was expected to occur sooner at 4000 and 8000 Hz than lower frequencies. Finally it was deduced that the occupational conditions of truck drivers may have bilateral, symmetrical harmful effect on hearing threshold sense in all frequencies mainly in frequency of 4000 Hz, so health surveillance programs such as education and periodic medical examinations are emphasized for pre-diagnosing and prevention of any possible impairment and an urgent need to take up some interventions such as better maintenance of roads, automobile industry efforts to reduce the noise level emission of vehicles and reducing number of working hours per day of drivers are highlighted to improve the harmful working conditions of truck drivers."
"20160389","Occupational exposure in small and medium scale industry with specific reference to heat and noise.","This study was undertaken to assess heat and noise exposure and occupational safety practices in small and medium scale casting and forging units (SMEs) of Northern India. We conducted personal interviews of 350 male workers of these units through a comprehensive questionnaire and collected information on heat and noise exposure, use of protective equipment, sweat loss and water intake, working hour. The ambient wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT index) was measured using quest temp 34/36o area heat stress monitor. A-weighted Leq ambient noise was measured using a quest sound level meter &quot;ANSI SI. 43-1997 (R 2002) type-1 model SOUNDPRO SE/DL&quot;. We also incorporated OSHA norms for hearing conservation which include - an exchange rate of 5dB(A), criterion level at 90dB(A), criterion time of eight hours, threshold level is equal to 80dB(A), upper limit is equal to 140dB(A) and with F/S response rate. Results of the study revealed that occupational heat exposure in melting, casting, forging and punching sections is high compared to ACGIH/NIOSH norms. Ambience noise in various sections like casting / molding, drop forging, cutting presses, punching, grinding and barreling process was found to be more than 90dB(A). About 95% of the workers suffered speech interference where as high noise annoyance was reported by only 20%. Overall, 68% workers were not using any personal protective equipment (PPE). The study concluded that the proportion of SME workers exposed to high level heat stress and noise (60 - 72 hrs/week) is high. The workers engaged in forging and grinding sections are more prone to noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) at higher frequencies as compared to workers of other sections.

The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of high frequency notch (HFN) in an audiovestibular medicine outpatient clinic population at a district general hospital. One hundred and forty nine consecutive adult patients were assessed. According to standard practice at the audiovestibular clinic, a full clinical history with particular emphasis on neuro-otological symptoms, noise exposure, and medical risk factors for sensorineural hearing loss was taken. After standard 8-frequency pure tone audiometry, subjects were divided into those with HFN and those without. There were 84 (56%) females and 65 (44%) males with a mean age of 45 years (range: 19 to 91 years). A total of 39.6% had notches not attributable to noise (occupational or recreational) or any other known risk factor. In 29 (49.2%) and 15 (25.4%) the HFN was present in the left and right ear respectively whereas 15 (25.4%) were bilateral. The frequency least affected was 3 kHz while 4 kHz and 6 kHz were affected in almost equal proportions. In 53 ears (71.6%), the notch depth was less than 20 dBHL (10-19 dB) compared to 21 ears (28.4%) with a depth of 20 dBHL or more. This study concludes that high frequency notch without excessive noise exposure or any other known factor is common. It is neither diagnostic of, nor invariable with NIHL unless a convincing history of hazardous noise exposure is elicited from the history."
"20143281","[Effect of asbestos fibre dust exposures on lung function--a systematic review].","Asbestos-induced lung diseases are in addition to skin diseases and hearing impairment due to noise the most frequent occupational diseases. In this connection, many questions arise. They particularly refer to the fine diagnostics and the compensation in case of early stages. This systematic review questions the prevailing practice of getting medical expert opinions. It was shown that already pleural plaques and low stages of lung fibrosis due to asbestos are significantly associated with symptoms of chronic obstructive bronchitis, lymphocytic alveolitis and significant functional restrictions, i. e. FVC, FEV (1) and TLC restrictions, gas exchange impairments (P ((A-a),O2), P (a,O2)), diffusion disorders (D (L,CO)) and an obstructive ventilation pattern (FEV (1)/FVC, FEF values, D (L,CO)). The asbestos fibre dose shows some relation to reductions of FVC, FEV (1), FEF values, and D (L,CO). Only about half of the asbestos-induced functional impairments are related to radiological (inclusive CT) findings. To a lesser degree, these findings also apply to exposed people without pathological chest X-ray findings. The diffusion capacity reduction, at first still within the reference range, is an early indication of a lung lesion caused by asbestos fibres. The same applies to spiroergometric parameters (P ((A-a),O2), V (E/)V (O2), V (D)/V (T)). Reduced lung compliance can also be determinable at an early asbestosis stage. The results of literature research confirmed by statements of international groups of experts indicate continuous pathophysiological processes due to asbestos fibres deposited in peripheral airways and in the lung. These processes are neither radiologically nor histopathologically detectable and occur with a chronic lymphocytic alveolitis. Therefore, diagnostics of asbestos-induced non-malignant lung and pleural changes require comprehensive lung function tests. The outcome may help to estimate the probable remaining life span."

Taken together, specific working conditions in civil aviation, socio-economic factors, and the structure of morbidity among the flight personnel hinder differential diagnosis of occupational loss of hearing in the pilots. A method for retrospective analysis of dynamic audiometry data is proposed to elucidate pathogenesis of occupational neurosensory deafness in the flight personnel. The method is based on the analysis of results of clinical and audiologic studies taking into consideration concomitant pathology (if any), age-related changes in the health status, intra-cabin aircraft noise characteristics, and objective evaluation of noise load on the organ of hearing during the entire period of professional occupation of individual members of the flight personnel. It is concluded that introduction of this method into routine practice of medical examination of the flight personnel in civilian aviation may contribute to the lowering of the frequency of hyperdiagnosis of occupational deafness in this category of workers."

Pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the development of occupational deafness were shown to depend on intensity and duration of the action of these factors. Impedancometry was used to evaluate the functional state of the middle ear and to study protective and adaptive potential of ear muscles. Criteria are proposed for the identification of groups of workers at risk of development of occupational deafness. The relationship between individual features of cerebral hemodynamics and the functional state of the middle ear is established."

The audiologic examination involved members of locomotive crews of the railroad transport and included impedancometry, threshold tonal audiometry, and registration of two types of evoked otoacoustic emission (delayed evoked otoacoustic emission and distortion product otoacoustic emission). Characteristics of otoacoustic emission in subjects with occupational loss of hearing were compared with those in patients with neurosensory deafness of a different etiology. It was shown that registration of different classes of evoked otoacoustic emission makes it possible to recognize early pre-clinical signs of inner ear disorders caused by intense occupational noise. The changes are first and foremost apparent within a frequency band of 4 kHz. At the same time, registration of individual types of evoked otoacoustic emission does not permit to differentiate between occupational loss of hearing and neurosensory deafness of other origin."

Firearm noise levels were evaluated, subjects answered a questionnaire and underwent threshold tonal audiometry and otoacoustic emissions testing.RESULTS: The average noise level was 125 dB(C). Most subjects (78%) believe that noise may cause hearing loss; nearly all (92.3%) used ear noise protectors while shooting, but most (32.3%) had never received guidance for using this equipment. There were significant differences between the two groups in relation to changes suggesting impact noise-induced hearing loss.CONCLUSION: The differences between groups show that noise-exposed military personnel are more likely to develop hearing loss. The goal of a hearing conservation program for this population should be to preserve hearing and educate these individuals about the importance of using hearing protection correctly."
"22176308","Measurement of impulse peak insertion loss for four hearing protection devices in field conditions.","OBJECTIVE: In 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed an impulse noise reduction rating (NRR) for hearing protection devices based upon the impulse peak insertion loss (IPIL) methods in the ANSI S12.42-2010 standard. This study tests the ANSI S12.42 methods with a range of hearing protection devices measured in field conditions.DESIGN: The method utilizes an acoustic test fixture and three ranges for impulse levels: 130-134, 148-152, and 166-170 dB peak SPL. For this study, four different models of hearing protectors were tested: Bilsom 707 Impact II electronic earmuff, E·A·R Pod Express, E·A·R Combat Arms version 4, and the Etymotic Research, Inc. Electronic BlastPLG EB1.STUDY SAMPLE: Five samples of each protector were fitted on the fixture or inserted in the fixture's ear canal five times for each impulse level. Impulses were generated by a 0.223 caliber rifle.RESULTS: The average IPILs increased with peak pressure and ranged between 20 and 38 dB. For some protectors, significant differences were observed across protector examples of the same model, and across insertions.CONCLUSIONS: The EPA's proposed methods provide consistent and reproducible results. The proposed impulse NRR rating should utilize the minimum and maximum protection percentiles as determined by the ANSI S12.42-2010 methods."

Plasma total antioxidant status, blood glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), antioxidant enzyme activities of GSH peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.9, GPx), superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1; SOD) in erythrocytes, nitric oxide and nitric oxide synthase in plasma were assessed before and after 6 days of administration of Vitamin E and Carbogen. Results of the study indicate that the exposure to noise for 6 days increased blood concentration of MDA, decreased concentrations of reduced GSH, antioxidant enzyme activity of SOD and plasma total antioxidant status in control (noise) group. Vitamin E- supplemented group showed decline in oxidative stress reflected by significant decrease in blood concentration of MDA and increase in antioxidant enzyme activity of erythrocyte SOD.

"22122956","High-frequency audiometry: a means for early diagnosis of noise-induced hearing loss.","Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), an irreversible disorder, is a common problem in industrial settings. Early diagnosis of NIHL can help prevent the progression of hearing loss, especially in speech frequencies. For early diagnosis of NIHL, audiometry is performed routinely in conventional frequencies. We designed this study to compare the effect of noise on high-frequency audiometry (HFA) and conventional audiometry. In a historical cohort study, we compared hearing threshold and prevalence of hearing loss in conventional and high frequencies of audiometry among textile workers divided into two groups: With and without exposure to noise more than 85 dB. The highest hearing threshold was observed at 4000 Hz, 6000 Hz and 16000 Hz in conventional right ear audiometry, conventional left ear audiometry and HFA in each ear, respectively. The hearing threshold was significantly higher at 16000 Hz compared to 4000. Hearing loss was more common in HFA than conventional audiometry. HFA is more sensitive to detect NIHL than conventional audiometry. It can be useful for early diagnosis of hearing sensitivity to noise, and thus preventing hearing loss in lower frequencies especially speech frequencies."

"22094854","Hearing profile of gold miners with and without tuberculosis.","OBJECTIVES: To compare the hearing of gold miners with and without tuberculosis (TB) to determine the effect of TB and its associated risk profile on hearing.METHODS: Audiological and medical surveillance data of 2698 South African gold miners for 2001-2009 were analysed in a retrospective cohort design. Hearing thresholds for the air conduction frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 kHz) in both ears were analysed together with biographical and occupational data. Subjects were divided into two experimental (single TB treatment, n=911 and multiple TB treatment, n=376) and one control group (n=1411). Comparisons between groups included (1) change from baseline to most recent audiogram, (2) most recent hearing thresholds and (3) most recent thresholds in a subset of noise exposed and unexposed groups.RESULTS: Hearing thresholds for the TB groups were significantly (p&lt;0.01) elevated compared to the control group, after correcting for time between baseline and most recent audiogram, threshold at baseline and age at test. Pair-wise comparisons demonstrated the largest threshold differences between the control and multiple TB group. Changes in mean thresholds across TB treatment groups were independent of noise exposure. Hearing thresholds over time also deteriorated significantly more (p&lt;0.01) in workers with TB (single and multiple treatment) than in workers without TB.CONCLUSION: Gold miners with TB, especially with more than one episode of TB, demonstrate significantly poorer hearing thresholds and more pronounced decline in hearing over time independent of noise exposure. The exact cause is likely a complex interaction between TB, including treatment, and its associated risk profile."
"22048583","Assessment of noise levels of the equipments used in the dental teaching institution, Bangalore.","CONTEXT: In dental practical classes, the acoustic environment is characterized by high noise levels in relation to other teaching areas, due to the exaggerated noise produced by some of these devices and use of dental equipment by many users at the same time.AIMS: To measure, analyze and compare noise levels of equipments among dental learning areas under different working conditions and also to measure and compare noise levels between used and brand new handpieces under different working conditions.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Noise levels were measured and analyzed in different dental learning areas that included clinical, pre-clinical areas and laboratories selected as representatives of a variety of learning-teaching activities.

"21988504","Speech-in-noise screening tests by internet, part 1: test evaluation for noise-induced hearing loss identification.","OBJECTIVE: In the Netherlands three internet-based self-screening tests have been developed; the National Hearing Test (NHT), Earcheck (EC), and Occupational Earcheck (OEC). These tests are adaptive speech-in-noise tests using either digit triplets or monosyllables, presented in stationary speech-shaped noise. These tests can be highly valuable in increasing the awareness and prevention of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). This study evaluates these online speech-in-noise tests and investigates their potential to detect NIHL.DESIGN: In a multi-centre study the results of the three online screening tests are compared to pure-tone audiometry and to the Dutch sentence SRT test ( Plomp &amp; Mimpen, 1979a ), which is considered the clinical standard.STUDY SAMPLE: In total, 49 normal-hearing listeners and 49 patients with different degrees of NIHL participated.RESULTS: The online tests show good reliability, but there is much overlap in outcomes between normal-hearing listeners and participants with early NIHL. In addition, rather low correlations of the test results with both the Dutch sentence SRT test and pure-tone thresholds are found. These findings result in rather low test sensitivity: 54% (NHT) and 51% (EC), or low specificity: 49% (OEC).CONCLUSIONS: The online screening tests in their current form are unsuitable to be used for early NIHL screening purposes."

This trial assessed whether the intervention resulted in (1) reduced prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) assessed clinically and/or (2) sustained use of hearing protection devices.METHODS: In 1992-1996, 34 rural Wisconsin schools were recruited and 17 were assigned randomly to receive a comprehensive, 3-year, hearing conservation intervention. In 2009-2010, extensive efforts were made to find and contact all students who completed the original trial. Participants in the 16-year follow-up study completed an exposure history questionnaire and a clinical audiometric examination. Rates of NIHL and use of hearing protection were compared.RESULTS: We recruited 392 participants from the original trial, 200 (53%) from the intervention group and 192 (51%) from the control group. Among participants with exposure to agricultural noise, the intervention group reported significantly greater use of hearing protection compared with the control group (25.9% vs 19.6%; P = .015). The intervention group also reported significantly greater use of hearing protection for shooting guns (56.2% vs 41.6%; P = .029), but the groups reported similar uses of protection in other contexts. There was no significant difference between groups with respect to objective measures of NIHL.CONCLUSION: This novel trial provides objective evidence that a comprehensive educational intervention by itself may be of limited effectiveness in preventing NIHL in a young rural population."
"21959117","Hearing status among aircraft maintenance personnel in a commercial airline company.","The aim was to study subjective and objective hearing loss in a population of aircraft maintenance workers and identify predictors. A total of 327 aircraft maintenance personnel answered a self-administered work environment questionnaire (response rate 76%) and underwent audiometric test. The mean values for the hearing threshold at 3, 4, and 6 kHz for the ear with the most hearing loss were compared with a Swedish population database of persons not occupationally exposed to noise. Equivalent noise exposure during a working day was measured. Relationships between subjective and objective hearing loss and possible predictors (age, years of employment, self-reported exposure to solvents, blood pressure, and psycho-social factors) were analyzed by multiple logistic regression. At younger ages (&lt;40 years), aircraft maintenance workers had higher hearing thresholds (1-3 dB) compared to the reference group, but such a difference was not found in older employees. Relationships were found between age and objective hearing loss, and between exposure to solvents and reported subjective hearing loss. Equivalent noise exposure during working days were 70-91 dB(A) with a maximal noise level of 119 dB(A). Aircraft maintenance workers are exposed to equivalent noise levels above the Swedish occupational standard, including some very high peak exposures. Younger employees have a higher age-matched hearing threshold level compared with a reference group. Thus, there is a need for further preventive measures."
"21959115","Hearing impairment among workers exposed to excessive levels of noise in ginning industries.","Cotton ginning workers have a risk of hearing loss due to excessive noise levels at the workplace environment. In this study, estimates of typical sound levels prevailing at the workplace environment and its effects on hearing ability of the exposed workers were made among cotton ginning workers. Data on self-reported health status was collected by a questionnaire survey at 10 cotton ginning industries located at Jalgaon district of Maharashtra state, India. The cotton ginning workers were exposed to continuous noise levels between 89 and 106 dBA. The hearing ability of the subjects was accessed by pure tone audiometry. The results of audiometry show mild, moderate and moderately severe degree of hearing impairment among the cotton ginning workers. The data generated during the study show that hearing loss was significantly associated with period of exposure to the workplace noise (P &lt;0.0001). The prevalence of audiometric hearing impairment defined as a threshold average greater than 25 dB hearing level was 96% for binaural low-frequency average, 97% for binaural mid frequency average and 94% for binaural high-frequency average in the cotton ginning workers. We recommend the compulsory use of personal protective equipment like ear plug by the cotton ginning workers at the workplace environment. A regular maintenance of ginning and pressing machineries will avoid the emission of excessive noise at the workplace environment of cotton gins. A regular periodic medical examination is necessary to measure the impact of workplace noise on the health of cotton ginning workers."
"21959114","Prevalence of hearing loss and accuracy of self-report among factory workers.","Noise represents one of the most common occupational health hazards. A Healthy People 2020 objective aims to reduce hearing loss in the noise-exposed public. The purpose of this study was to describe and compare perceived and measured hearing, and to determine the prevalence of hearing loss among a group of factory workers. Data collected as part of an intervention study promoting hearing protector use among workers at an automotive factory in the Midwest were used. Plant employees (n=2691) provided information regarding their perceived hearing ability, work role, and other demographics. The relationships among audiograms, a single-item measure of perceived hearing ability, and demographic data were explored using chi-square, McNemar's test, Mann-Whitney U-test, sensitivity, and specificity. The prevalence of hearing loss among noise-exposed factory workers was 42% (where hearing loss was defined as &gt;25 dB loss at the OSHA-recommended frequencies of 2, 3, and 4 kHz in either ear). However, 76% of workers reported their hearing ability as excellent or good. The difference in perceived hearing ability was significant at each tested frequency between those with and without measured hearing loss. Self-reported hearing ability was poorly related to results of audiometry. Although this group of workers was employed in a regulated environment and served by a hearing conservation program, hearing loss was highly prevalent. These findings, together with national prevalence estimates, support the need for evaluation of hearing conservation programs and increased attention to the national goal of reducing adult hearing loss."

Where the source of the noise cannot be eliminated, workers have to rely on hearing protection equipment. Several trials have been conducted to study the effectiveness of interventions to influence the wearing of hearing protection.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to enhance the wearing of hearing protection among persons regularly exposed to high noise levels.SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 1); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 8 April 2011.SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies if they had a randomised design, if they were among noise exposed (&gt; 80 dB(A)) persons, if they included an intervention to promote the wearing of hearing protection (compared to another intervention or no intervention), and if the outcome measured was the amount of use of hearing protection or a proxy measure thereof.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors selected relevant trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.MAIN RESULTS: Seven studies, involving 4670 participants, were included.A computer-based intervention lasting 30 minutes, tailored to the risk of an individual worker, was not found to be more effective than a video providing general information among workers, around 80% of whom already used hearing protection.A four-year school-based hearing loss prevention programme found that the intervention group was twice as likely to wear some kind of hearing protection as the control group that received a baseline hearing test and two additional tests at years two and three.We conducted two meta-analyses for the comparisons 'tailored strategy (the use of communication or other types of interventions that are specific to an individual or a group and aim to change behaviour) versus non-tailored strategy' and 'tailored strategy versus a commercial video on the use of hearing protection' to look at mean percentage use of hearing protective devices (HPDs), that showed improvement in the mean use of HPDs for the tailored group. A meta-analysis of the comparison 'mixed interventions' (classroom instruction, distribution of HPDs, mailings, noise level assessments and audiometric testing) versus control (audiometric testing alone) also showed improvement in self reported use of HPDs when shooting firearms.Tailored education showed an improvement in HPD use of 8.3% versus targeted education (6.1%).AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence found in this review shows that some interventions improve the mean use of hearing protection devices compared to non-intervention. Future trials should have standard outcomes and interventions to allow the combining of results in meta-analysis."
"21873915","Validity of self-rated hearing compared with audiometric measurement among construction workers.","BACKGROUND: A valid assessment of hearing status is important to detect hearing loss early and prevent further loss in noise-exposed individuals or older adults. Self-report is used widely in research and is often the only possible measure to evaluate hearing ability.OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to establish the level of validity of self-rated hearing by comparing it with the results of audiograms and to examine correlations and changes in self-rated and measured hearing status over time.METHODS: Survey and audiogram data collected from 403 construction workers at two different time points (Years 1 and 2) were used in the hearing protection intervention study. Self-rated hearing was assessed on a 5-point rating scale using a single question (&quot;How do you rate your hearing?&quot;). Hearing was measured via audiograms conducted at frequencies 0.5 through 8 kHz. Three pure-tone threshold average (PTA) indicators, PTA 0.5-2 kHz, PTA 0.5-3 kHz, and PTA 4-6 kHz, of the worse ear were used and compared with self-ratings at two time points.RESULTS: Percentage of agreement between the self-rated and measured hearing was lowest in PTA 4-6 kHz and highest in PTA 0.5-3 kHz for both years. Cohen's kappas showed fair to moderate (.25-.45) agreement. Sensitivity was higher (.82-.89) in the speech frequencies and lower (.51-.55) at higher frequencies. Specificity was better at higher frequencies than at lower frequencies (.83-.89 vs .68-.74). Although there was no appreciable change in self-rated hearing and limited change in measured hearing on all 3 indicators from Years 1 to 2, correlations between self-rated and measured hearing were higher in Year 2.DISCUSSION: A single-item question about an individual's hearing ability is moderately useful and valid to assess hearing loss and can be recommended for a population-based study only if audiograms are not available, but self-report hearing screening should not be considered an adequate substitute for the standardized audiometric test. Providing audiograms and feedback on the results apparently enhanced individuals' ability to judge their hearing status."

The procedures included the following items: questionnaire regarding personal and professional background, period of exposition to organophosphates, otoscopy, pure-tone audiometry. Auditory temporal processing was tested through: the Frequency Pattern Test, the Duration Pattern Test and the Gaps-In-Noise Test. Performance on the tests were analyzed, as well as differences between left and right ears on the Gaps-In-Noise Test, and education level in all tests.RESULTS: In great part of the subjects, auditory temporal processing performance was below normal standards. There was no difference between ears on the Gaps-In-Noise Test (p=0.33). Additionally, no differences were found on any of the tests according to education level (Gaps-In-Noise: p=0.21 on the right ear, and p=0.053 on the left ear; Frequency Pattern Test: p=0.37; Duration Pattern Test: p=0.84).CONCLUSION: Temporal resolution and temporal order abilities were altered in individuals occupationally exposed to organophosphate pesticides, even when they showed normal peripheral auditory thresholds."

In this paper, we develop and explore several long-term exposure estimates for cohort members.METHODS: We followed cohort members between 1999 and 2009 and interviewed them approximately annually to obtain a detailed work history for the previous subject-interval while also collecting tests of hearing sensitivity. Over the same period, we also collected a sample of full-shift average noise measurements and activity information. We used data from these two sources to develop various exposure estimates for each subject for specific subject intervals and for the duration of the study. These estimates included work duration, trade-mean (TM)-equivalent continuous exposure level (L(EQ)), task-based (TB) L(EQ), a hybrid L(EQ) combining TB and subjective information, and an estimate of noise exposure 'peakiness'.RESULTS: Of the 456 subjects enrolled in the study, 333 had at least 2 interviews and met several inclusion criteria related to hearing sensitivity. Depending on the metric used, between one-third and three-quarters of 1310 measured full-shift noise exposures exceeded permissible and recommended exposure limits. Hybrid and TB exposure estimates demonstrated much greater variability than TM estimates. Work duration and estimates of exposure peakiness showed poor agreement with average exposures, suggesting that these metrics evaluate different aspects of exposure and may have different predictive value for estimating NIHL.CONCLUSIONS: Construction workers in the cohort had subject-interval and study-average exposures which present a substantial potential risk of NIHL. In a subsequent paper, we will use these estimates to evaluate the exposure-response relationship between noise and NIHL."
"21822855","Audiological implications of earplugs used for the prevention of aural exostoses.","External auditory canal exostoses may be a preventable disease, so it is surprising that the regular use of water precautions is not greater among surfers. One reason for this is the impairment of hearing whilst wearing earplugs. The objective of this study is to establish the hearing impairment of commonly available earplugs used by surfers. Staff and patients with normal hearing were recruited to have pure tone audiometry performed multiple times, initially with no earplugs, and subsequently with earplugs. Three earplug types were tested which differed in their nature and material (prefabricated elastomer, custom-fitted silicone, and custom-fitted acrylic). Vented and non-vented forms of the earplugs were tested. 30 normal hearing ears were included. Two-tailed paired t-tests comparing hearing thresholds between different earplugs identified that the elastomer earplugs caused the least hearing impairment (p &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference in hearing thresholds between vented and non-vented elastomer earplugs (p = 0.148), but the difference between vented and non-vented forms of other earplugs was statistically significant (silicone p = 0.010, acrylic p = 0.018). Prefabricated ear plugs produce less hearing impairment than other commonly available earplugs. A customised earplug made of hard material causes the greatest impairment of hearing. We therefore recommend that for aquatic sports where hearing is important, a soft prefabricated earplug is preferable."
"21812635","A multicenter study on the audiometric findings of styrene-exposed workers.","OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate hearing loss among workers exposed to styrene, alone or with noise.DESIGN: This cross-sectional study was conducted as part of NoiseChem, a European Commission 5th Framework Programme research project, by occupational health institutes in Finland, Sweden, and Poland.STUDY SAMPLE: Participants' ages ranged from 18-72 years (n = 1620 workers). Participants exposed to styrene, alone or with noise, were from reinforced fiberglass products manufacturing plants (n = 862). Comparison groups were comprised of workers noise-exposed (n = 400) or controls (n = 358). Current styrene exposures ranged from 0 to 309 mg/m(3), while mean current noise levels ranged from 70-84 dB(A). Hearing thresholds of styrene-exposed participants were compared with Annexes A and B from ANSI S3.44, 1996.RESULTS: The audiometric thresholds of styrene exposed workers were significantly poorer than those in published standards. Age, gender, and styrene exposure met the significance level criterion in the multiple logistic regression for the binary outcome 'hearing loss' (P = 0.0000). Exposure to noise (&lt;85 dBA p = 0.0001; =85 dB(A) p = 0.0192) interacted significantly with styrene exposure.CONCLUSIONS: Occupational exposure to styrene is a risk factor for hearing loss, and styrene-exposed workers should be included in hearing loss prevention programs."
"21802644","Dichotic multiple-frequency auditory steady-state responses in evaluating the hearing thresholds of occupational noise-exposed workers.","An objective, fast, and reasonably accurate assessment test that allows for easy interpretation of the responses of the hearing thresholds at all frequencies of a conventional audiogram is needed to resolve the medicolegal aspects of an occupational hearing injury. This study evaluated the use of dichotic multiple-frequency auditory steady-state responses (Mf-ASSR) to predict the hearing thresholds in workers exposed to high levels of noise. The study sample included 34 workers with noise-induced hearing impairment. Thresholds of pure-tone audiometry (PTA) and Mf-ASSRs at four frequencies were assessed. The differences and correlations between the thresholds of Mf-ASSRs and PTA were determined. The results showed that, on average, Mf-ASSR curves corresponded well with the thresholds of the PTA contours averaged across subjects. The Mf-ASSRs were 20±8dB, 16±9dB, 12±9dB, and 11±12dB above the thresholds of the PTA for 500Hz, 1,000Hz, 2,000Hz, and 4,000Hz, respectively. The thresholds of the PTA and the Mf-ASSRs were significantly correlated (r=0.77-0.89). We found that the measurement of Mf-ASSRs is easy and potentially time saving, provides a response at all dichotic multiple frequencies of the conventional audiogram, reduces variability in the interpretation of the responses, and correlates well with the behavioral hearing thresholds in subjects with occupational noise-induced hearing impairment. Mf-ASSR can be a valuable aid in the adjustment of compensation cases."
"21786748","Effects of gene-environmental interaction on noise-induced hearing threshold levels for high frequencies (HTLHF).","In this study we assessed the interaction between glutathione S-transferase (GST) genetic polymorphisms and noise exposures, with regard to their effect on the hearing threshold levels for high frequencies (HTLHF). Research participants comprised 347 male workers, and each participant's cumulative noise exposure was determined using a job-exposure matrix. Approximately 64.6% of the participants' exposure in L(eq-8 h) was above 90 dBA. The mean HTLHF was 32.1 dB. A significant dose-response relationship was found between noise exposure and HTLHF. We further converted the estimated total noise exposure level over each participant's job history to a noise exposure level that corresponded to a 40-year exposure (L(eq-40y)). After we had adjusted the results for age, we found that workers carrying GSTM1 null, GSTT1 null, and GSTP1 Ile(105)/Ile(105) genotypes were susceptible to the HTLHF when their L(eq-40y) were above 90 dBA. Therefore, GST genetic polymorphisms might affect HTLHF only when workers are exposed to high noise levels."

They were all exposed to noise over the risk-limits from weapons and vehicles and used earmuffs and/or earplugs. Questionnaires and pure tone screening audiometry were studied at the start and the end of the military service. Retrospective information regarding audiometry at conscription before military service was included as control. The prevalence values of tinnitus were 23% before and 32% after the service and of sensitivity to noise 16% and 19% respectively. The prevalence values of hearing impairment were 6.3% at conscription, 14.5% at reporting to military service, and 24% after the training period. The incidence values of hearing decline were 3.7% during the period with no military noise exposure and 6.6% during the military service. Acoustic accident increased the risk of worsened tinnitus and sensitivity to noise four times and for a high frequency hearing decline six times. We observed elevated prevalence values of tinnitus, sensitivity to noise and hearing impairment at discharge compared to before military service. We observed an elevated risk of hearing decline during military service. Acoustic accident increased the risk of tinnitus, noise sensitivity and hearing decline. We suggest improvements regarding inclusion criteria for military service, and for education regarding the HCP."

Pure tone average hearing thresholds, for each ear, were compared between groups, and between sexes and ages within groups.RESULTS: A slight threshold difference was found between the two groups at 4 kHz. After adjusting for age and gender, this difference was found to be related only to differing patient age. Men's and women's thresholds differed significantly in both groups, especially at high frequencies, at which threshold deterioration was worse in men than women.CONCLUSION: The threshold differences between patients with presbycusis with and without noise exposure were limited. Larger studies are needed to assess the relative effects of ageing and noise exposure on hearing thresholds."

The methods that have been proposed are based on two principles: the morphological evaluation of the audiometric curve (eg. Merluzzi-Pira-Bosio--MPB) or the average hearing loss on different frequencies (eg. Albera-Beatrice--AB). The purpose of this study was to classify audiograms compatible with chronic acoustic trauma performed at the Occupational Medicine Outpatient Clinic of CTO Hospital in Turin from 2004 to 2011 with the methods outlined in Guidelines published by SIMLII. A substantial agreement among the methods was observed. While MPB is the most appropriate method for secondary prevention, the AB would seem more appropriate for the verification of a permanent weakening that has to be reported to the competent legal authorities."

"21695357","Evidence of noise-induced hearing loss in young people studying popular music.","The number of students studying popular music, music technology, and sound engineering courses at both school and university to has increased rapidly in the last few years. These students are generally involved in music-making/recording and listening to a high level, usually in environments with amplified music. Recent studies have shown that these students are potentially exposed to a high risk of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL( and are not covered by the same regulatory framework as employees. This study examined the pure tone air conduction hearing thresholds of 50 undergraduate students, including recent school leavers, on a range of popular music courses, to assess if there was evidence of hearing loss. Forty-four percent of students showed evidence of audiometric notch at 4-6 kHz, and 16% were classified under the UK Occupational Health and Safety guidelines as exhibiting mild hearing loss. Instance of audiometric notch was considerably higher than reported from studies of the general population but was around the same level or lower than that reported from studies of &quot;traditional&quot; music courses and conservatoires, suggesting no higher risk for popular music students than for &quot;classical&quot; music students. No relationship with age was present, suggesting that younger students were as likely to exhibit audiometric notch as mature students. This indicates that these students may be damaging their hearing through leisure activities while still at school, suggesting a need for robust education measures to focus on noise exposure of young people."
"21682404","Is it necessary to penalize impulsive noise +5 dB due to higher risk of hearing damage?","It is studied whether the +5 dB penalty for impulsiveness established by ISO 1999:1990 accounts for a higher risk of noise-induced hearing loss. A total of 16 normal-hearing human subjects were exposed for 10 min to two types of binaural industrial-recordings: (1) a continuous broad-band noise normalized to L(EX,8 h)=80 dBA and (2) the combination of the previous stimulus with an impulsive noise normalized to L(EX,8 h)=75+5(db penalty)=80 dBA (peak level 117 dBC and repetition rate of 0.5 impacts per second). Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were measured in a broad frequency range before and in the following 90 min after the exposure. The group results show that the continuous exposure had a bigger impact on DPOAE levels, with a maximum DPOAE shift of approximately 5 dB in the frequency range of 2-3.15 kHz during the first 10 min of the recovery. No evident DPOAE shift is seen for the impulsive + continuous stimulus. The results indicate that the penalty overestimated the effects on DPOAE levels and support the concept that the risk of hearing loss from low-level impulses may be predicted on an equal-energy basis."
"21682395","Speech recognition in noise with active and passive hearing protectors: a comparative study.","The perceived negative influence of standard hearing protectors on communication is a common argument for not wearing them. Thus, &quot;augmented&quot; protectors have been developed to improve speech intelligibility. Nevertheless, their actual benefit remains a point of concern. In this paper, speech perception with active earplugs is compared to standard passive custom-made earplugs. The two types of active protectors included amplify the incoming sound with a fixed level or to a user selected fraction of the maximum safe level. For the latter type, minimal and maximal amplification are selected. To compare speech intelligibility, 20 different speech-in-noise fragments are presented to 60 normal-hearing subjects and speech recognition is scored. The background noise is selected from realistic industrial noise samples with different intensity, frequency, and temporal characteristics. Statistical analyses suggest that the protectors' performance strongly depends on the noise condition. The active protectors with minimal amplification outclass the others for the most difficult and the easiest situations, but they also limit binaural listening. In other conditions, the passive protectors clearly surpass their active counterparts. Subsequently, test fragments are analyzed acoustically to clarify the results. This provides useful information for developing prototypes, but also indicates that tests with human subjects remain essential."

Data were available for 89/99 right/left ears on enlistment and 99/100 for LGV. Mean time between examinations was 4.1 years (range 1.4-12.6 years). By the LGV examination, there was deterioration in 69/99 right and 77/100 left ears, with the hearing loss in 8% of right and 13% of left ears falling into the 'warning' or 'referral' categories (Control of Noise at Work Regulations 2005) compared with 1% at enlistment. These differences reached statistical significance (P &lt; 0.05 and &lt; 0.001, respectively)CONCLUSIONS: Statistically significant hearing losses occur in some firefighters during the early stages of their careers.

"21617964","Determination of noise induced hearing loss in mining: an application of hierarchical loglinear modelling.","The levels of noise arise from mining industry seem to be higher when compared to other industries. For this reason, noise exposure and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) are prevalent in mining. Assessment of noise emission levels that arise from various mining operations is required to prevent and minimize the NIHL. Because the studies for preventing occupational hearing loss among miners are inadequate, a quarry and stone crushing-screening plant was selected to generate site-specific data. The noise levels of the environments in which workers work were measured and also a hearing test centre applied hearing tests to the workers. According to the hearing test results, it was determined that the part of workers have hearing loss. The main factors affecting the NIHL were assumed as experience, noise level, miners' age and occupation, and by taking into account the sub factors of the main factors, multi way contingency tables were prepared. Then hierarchical loglinear analysis method was implemented to categorized data; thus, the probabilities might effect NIHL was investigated. At the end of this study, it was found that the most risky occupation group was the drivers, and additionally, these workers were mostly exposed to 70-79 dB(A) noise level. When the important interactions are evaluated, it is determined that 4-11 years experienced crusher workers have high probability of NIHL because of high exposure to 90-99 dB(A) noise level. Moreover, the most important interactions which may affect the NIHL were identified and the precautions to reduce hearing loss were presented."
"21407078","Speech intelligibility and passive, level-dependent earplugs.","OBJECTIVES: Noise-induced hearing loss is one of the most common occupational diseases. Military personnel are at especially high risk due to the broad range of military noise hazards and the frequency of exposure. Hearing protectors are vital for this particular workforce, yet they can impede the ability to understand necessary communication in the field. Level-dependent hearing protectors are designed to protect the auditory system from the hazards of impulse noise, while preserving the ability to hear speech and other important auditory signals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of two different passive, level-dependent earplugs (Combat Arms Earplugs; Sonic II Ear valves) on speech understanding of normal-hearing listeners in the presence of low-level background noise. The Combat Arms Earplug, developed specifically for use by military personnel, represented devices that attenuate impulse noise using small orifices and the Sonic II ear valve represented devices using an internal diaphragm.DESIGN: This study used a repeated-measures experimental design. Four scrambled lists of each of the four Northwestern University No. 6 50-word lists were presented in random order at 65 dB SPL in the presence of quiet and two different types of background noise: multitalker and military vehicle noise; using three ear conditions: NP (open ear), CA (Combat Arms Earplugs), and SO (Sonic II earplugs); and three signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs): -10, 0, and +10 dB. Word recognition scores (WRSs) of 18 native English-speaking adults with normal hearing sensitivity were measured in all test conditions. The percentage of words correctly repeated was used to determine differences between the two different level-dependent devices, types of background noise, and SNRs.RESULTS: Results showed a statistically significant increase in WRS as SNR increased from -10 to +10 dB. A repeated-measures analysis of variance for ear condition × noise × SNR indicated a significant main effect for SNR but not for type of noise or ear condition. A slight but significant interaction was found for SNR and ear condition.CONCLUSIONS: SNR had great impact on the ability of listeners to understand speech in the presence of background noise; however, the type of noise and the type of level-dependent device used did not. The results of the study support the notion that individuals potentially subjected to high-level impulse noise should be able to use level-dependent earplugs in low-level continuous noise without compromising speech understanding. More specifically, the passive, level-dependent earplugs currently used by military personnel do not appear to be detrimental to speech communication for listeners with normal hearing when the speech is at an average conversational level and the listener is actively attending to the signal."

A sample of 30 subjects (19 to 77 years of age) was assessed with computer-based (KUDUwave 5000) and industry standard conventional audiometers (GSI 61) to compare air and bone conduction thresholds and test-retest reliability. Air conduction thresholds for the two audiometers corresponded within 5 dB or less in more than 90% of instances, with an average absolute difference of 3.5 dB (3.8 SD) and a 95% confidence interval of 2.6 to 4.5 dB. Bone conduction thresholds for the two audiometers corresponded within 10 dB or less in 92% of instances, with an average absolute difference of 4.9 dB (4.9 SD) and a 95% confidence interval of 3.6 to 6.1 dB. The average absolute test-retest threshold difference for bone conduction on the industry standard audiometer was 5.1 dB (5.3 SD) and for the computer-based audiometer 7.1 dB (6.4 SD). Computer-based audiometry provided air and bone conduction thresholds within the test-retest reliability limits of industry standard audiometry."

If administrative and/or exposure criteria are lacking, the regional occupational disease commission (CRRMP) is seized to pronounce an opinion - favourable or not - on the direct link between occupational activity and the deafness.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at determining the decisive factors in this opinion.METHODS: An exhaustive retrospective investigation analysed conclusions of CRRMP of the region Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur-Corsica related to the noise-induced hearing loss declarations emitted anonymously between January 1st, 2005 and December 31st, 2007. Favourable and unfavourable opinions were listed then cross-examined against the sociodemographics data of the employees, areas of expertise of the physicians at the origin of the initial medical certificate, grounds for submission to the commission, the occupational physician's opinion on the occupational origin, the results of the engineering consultant's investigation, the audiogram of the first observation of injury and those made in period of noise exposure.RESULTS: One hundred and twenty conclusions were analyzed. Claimants, typically male, 59-year-old on average, mainly came from the sectors of the metal industry (46.7%), transportation (20.8%) and building and civil engineering works (15.8%). All in all, 57.5% of the declarations were refused. These refusals were mainly connected to an opinion unfavourable, unexploitable or absent in the occupational physician, an overrun of the care period when it lasted 5 years and more and the absence of hearing deficit during the exposure.PERSPECTIVES: The results of our study lead to recommend the implementation of a certificate of noise exposure and the realization of an audiogram at the end of exposure to reduce the number of badly informed files and bring an answer more adapted to the demands of occupational noise-induced hearing loss acknowledgements."

"21368442","Development and validation of a field microphone-in-real-ear approach for measuring hearing protector attenuation.","Numerous studies have shown that the reliability of using laboratory measurements to predict individual or even group hearing protector attenuation for occupationally exposed workers is quite poor. This makes it difficult to properly assign hearing protectors when one wishes to closely match attenuation to actual exposure. An alternative is the use of field-measurement methods, a number of which have been proposed and are beginning to be implemented. We examine one of those methods, namely the field microphone-in-real-ear (F-MIRE) approach in which a dual-element microphone probe is used to measure noise reduction by quickly sampling the difference in noise levels outside and under an earplug, with appropriate adjustments to predict real-ear attenuation at threshold (REAT). We report on experiments that validate the ability of one commercially available F-MIRE device to predict the REAT of an earplug fitted identically for two tests. Results are reported on a representative roll-down foam earplug, stemmed-style pod plug, and pre-molded earplug, demonstrating that the 95% confidence level of the Personal Attenuation Rating (PAR) as a function of the number of fits varies from ± 4.4 dB to ± 6.3 dB, depending on the plug type, which can be reduced to ± 3.1 dB to ± 4.5 dB with a single repeat measurement. The added measurement improves precision substantially. However, the largest portion of the error is due to the user's fitting variability and not the uncertainty of the measurement system. Further we evaluated the inherent uncertainty of F-MIRE vs. the putative &quot;gold standard&quot; REAT procedures finding, that F-MIRE measurement uncertainty is less than one-half that of REAT at most test frequencies. An American National Standards Institute (ANSI) working group (S12/WG11) is currently involved in developing methods similar to those in this paper so that procedures for evaluating and reporting uncertainty on all types of field attenuation measurement systems can be standardized. We conclude that the hearing conservationist now has available a portable, convenient, quick, and easy-to-use system that can improve training and motivation of employees, assign hearing protection devices based on noise exposures, and address other management and compliance issues."

Naïve subjects were recruited and tested using three different forms of training: written, video, and individual training. The group averages for A-weighted attenuation were not statistically significant when compared between the video or the written instruction conditions, regardless of presentation order. The experimenter-trained A-weighted attenuations were significantly greater than the written and video instruction for most of the protectors and groups. For each earplug, the noise reduction statistic for A-weighting (NRS A ) and the associated confidence intervals were calculated for the 80 th and 20 th percentiles of protection. Across subject groups for each protector, the differences between NRS A ratings were found to be not statistically significant. Several comparisons evaluating the order of testing, the type of testing, and statistical tests of the performance across the groups are presented."

This training was paired with audiometry and counseling and a survey of attitudes and beliefs in hearing loss prevention. All participants received hearing tests, multimedia instruction on occupational noise exposure/hearing loss, and instruction and practice in using a diverse selection of hearing protection devices (HPDs). A total of 103 apprentice carpenters participated in the Year 1 training, were given a large supply of these HPDs, and instructions on how to get additional free supplies if they ran out during the 1-year interval between initial and follow-up training. Forty-two participants responded to the survey a second time a year later and completed the Year 2 training. Significant test-retest differences were found between the pre-training and the post-training survey scores. Both forms of instruction (individual versus group) produced equivalent outcomes. The results indicated that training was able to bring all apprentice participants up to the same desired level with regard to attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral intentions to use hearing protection properly. It was concluded that the health communication models used to develop the educational and training materials for this effort were extremely effective."

However, commonly-used audiometric databases either do not take these differences into account, or account for them using data not easily generalized to the US population. The objective of this study was to obtain distributions that are generalizable to the US population without significant history of exposure to occupational noise. Cumulative pure tone threshold distributions from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III and the 1999-2004 data from the continuous NHANES were fitted with an asymmetric sigmoid function with reverse asymmetry, by gender, ethnicity, age, ear, and the stimulus frequency. Results indicated that conditional distributions based on these factors are warranted. Percentiles on the cumulative distribution functions can be transformed into standard normal variates (i.e. z-scores) to facilitate combination of results over time or across individuals with different demographic characteristics. However, combinations across frequency could obscure meaningful differences between the reference group and the hearing test results under analysis."

Our aim was to follow a cohort of divers through the first 6 years of their career in order to look for evidence of permanent threshold shift associated with diving activity, occupational noise exposure or acute injuries. Hearing was measured by pure tone audiometry in 67 participants at a basic course for working divers. Hearing thresholds were adjusted for age (ISO 7029). The subjects were examined and interviewed by an otologist. Additional medical and exposure data were recorded in questionnaires and personal logbooks. The procedure was repeated after 3 and 6 years. None of the subjects suffered inner ear barotrauma or inner ear decompression sickness during follow-up. Middle ear barotrauma was common. The prevalence of subjective hearing difficulties increased during follow-up, and there was a significant threshold shift at 4 kHz (mean 2.6 dB, 95% confidence interval 0.9-4.3 dB). Both subjective and objective hearing loss was associated with occupational noise exposure, but not with diving frequency or with a history of middle ear barotrauma. In the absence of manifest inner ear barotrauma or inner ear decompression sickness, noise seems to be the most important cause of long-term hearing loss in occupational divers. This study did not find evidence of long-term hearing loss caused by uneventful diving per se."

"21203771","A retrospective analysis of noise-induced hearing loss in the Dutch construction industry.","PURPOSE: Noise exposure is an important and highly prevalent occupational hazard in the construction industry. This study examines hearing threshold levels of a large population of Dutch construction workers and compares their hearing thresholds to those predicted by ISO-1999.METHODS: In this retrospective study, medical records of periodic occupational health examinations of 29,644 construction workers are analysed. Pure-tone audiometric thresholds of noise-exposed workers are compared to a non-exposed control group and to ISO-1999 predictions. Regression analyses are conducted to explore the relationship between hearing loss and noise intensity, noise exposure time and the use of hearing protection.RESULTS: Noise-exposed workers had greater hearing losses compared to their non-noise-exposed colleagues and to the reference population reported in ISO-1999. Noise exposure explained only a small proportion of hearing loss. When the daily noise exposure level rose from 80 dB(A) towards 96 dB(A), only a minor increase in hearing loss is shown. The relation of exposure time and hearing loss found was similar to ISO-1999 predictions when looking at durations of 10 years or more. For the first decade, the population medians show poorer hearing than predicted by ISO-1999.DISCUSSION: Duration of noise exposure was a better predictor than noise exposure levels, probably because of the limitations in noise exposure estimations. In this population, noise-induced hearing loss was already present at the beginning of employment and increased at the same rate as is predicted for longer exposure durations."
"21203368","The influence of hearing impairment on sleep quality among workers exposed to harmful noise.","OBJECTIVE: To assess connections between sleeping quality and hearing impairment due to prolonged exposure to industrial noise.DESIGN: Observational cross-sectional study.SETTING: Occupational clinic of the Clalit Health Services in Israel.PARTICIPANTS: 298 male volunteers occupationally exposed to harmful noise, who had an audiometric examination performed by an occupational nurse as a part of the national workers health supervision programs.MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The participants underwent an audiometric testing, and their sleep quality was measured by a validated Mini Sleep Questionnaire (MSQ). Participants with hearing loss greater than 25 dBA in the range of 1000-4000 Hz were defined as the research group (n = 99) and were compared to those with no hearing impairment (n = 199). Sleeping disorders were age related (30% higher MSQ score among workers above 50 years, P = 0.003). Tinnitus was the highest sleep disturbing factor, with 75% higher score among those affected, P = 0.001. In multiple linear regression analysis, tinnitus was the leading sleep-disturbing factor (regression coefficient B = 8.66, P &lt; 0.001) followed by hearing impairment (regression coefficient B = 2.42, P = 0.084), adjusted for age (or years of exposure) and coffee drinking. A part of the MSQ, related to insomnia, was further evaluated using logistic regression models. Tinnitus was again the leading sleep disturbing factor [OR = 11.91; CI95% (1.56-91.2)], followed by hearing impairment [OR = 3.051; CI95% (1.18-7.86)].CONCLUSION: Although tinnitus was the main sleep disrupting factor, hearing impairment among workers occupationally exposed to harmful noise, independently contributed to sleep impairment, especially to insomnia, regardless of age and years of exposure."
"21193566","Effect of daily noise exposure monitoring on annual rates of hearing loss in industrial workers.","OBJECTIVES: Occupational noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is prevalent, yet evidence on the effectiveness of preventive interventions is lacking. The effectiveness of a new technology allowing workers to monitor daily at-ear noise exposure was analysed.METHODS: Workers in the hearing conservation program of an aluminium smelter were recruited because of accelerated rates of hearing loss. The intervention consisted of daily monitoring of at-ear noise exposure and regular feedback on exposures from supervisors. The annual rate of change in high frequency hearing average at 2, 3 and 4 KHz before intervention (2000-2004) and 4 years after intervention (2006-2009) was determined. Annual rates of loss were compared between 78 intervention subjects and 234 controls in other company smelters matched for age, gender and high frequency hearing threshold level in 2005.RESULTS: Individuals monitoring daily noise exposure experienced on average no further worsening of high frequency hearing (average rate of hearing change at 2, 3 and 4 KHz = -0.5 dB/year). Matched controls also showed decelerating hearing loss, the difference in rates between the two groups being significant (p &lt; 0.0001). Analysis of a subset of intervention subjects matched to controls for initial rate of hearing loss showed a similar trend but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.06).CONCLUSION: Monitoring daily occupational noise exposure inside hearing protection with ongoing administrative feedback apparently reduces the risk of occupational NIHL in industrial workers. Longer follow-up of these workers will help determine the significance of the intervention effect. Intervention studies for the prevention of NIHL need to include appropriate control groups."
"23267007","Consistency of attenuation across multiple fittings of custom and non-custom earplugs.","Hearing protection devices (HPDs) play a significant role in protecting workers from occupational noise-induced hearing loss. Individual HPD fit-testing estimates the amount of protection, or attenuation, that an individual achieves from a given HPD as it is worn. Results from a single fit-test may not be representative of real-world HPD performance over time, however, due to inconsistency in how the individual fits the HPD from time to time. In this study, the effects of HPD type and user training on the consistency of attenuation achieved across multiple fittings were evaluated in a within-subjects design. Attenuation measurements using a real-ear attenuation at threshold procedure were obtained on 30 participants wearing custom-molded and non-custom earplugs. The subjects were initially naive to proper earplug insertion techniques and later received one-on-one training for the second half of the attenuation measurements. Consistency, or reliability, of fit was assessed using (i) the standard deviation of the 'distance to ear mean attenuation', a measure of fitting uncertainty, and (ii) the standard deviation of the attenuation values across multiple fit-tests for each subject. The custom earplug provided statistically significantly better consistency of attenuation than the non-custom earplug at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz. Training effects were statistically significant at 250, 500, and 1000 Hz and at the Personal Attenuation Rating. No interactions were statistically significant. These results indicate that, in general, subjects obtained more consistent attenuation with the custom earplugs than with the non-custom earplugs and that consistency improved with training for both earplug types."

"23259813","Speech recognition index of workers with tinnitus exposed to environmental or occupational noise: a comparative study.","INTRODUCTION: Tinnitus is considered the third worst symptom affecting humans. The aim of this article is to assess complaints by workers with tinnitus exposed to environmental and occupational noise.METHODOLOGY: 495 workers went through an epidemiological survey at the Audiology Department of the Center for Studies on Workers' Health and Human Ecology, from 2003 to 2007. The workers underwent tonal and vocal audiometry, preceded by a clinical and occupational history questionnaire. Two-factor ANOVA and Tukey were the statistical tests used. All the analysis set statistical significance at a=5%.FINDINGS: There was a higher prevalence of occupational tinnitus (73.7%), a predominance of female domestic workers (65.4%) in cases of environmental exposure, and predominance of male construction workers (71.5%) for occupational exposure. There was a significant difference in workers with hearing loss, who showed a mean speech recognition index (SRI) of 85%, as compared to healthy workers with a mean SRI greater than 93.5%. Signs and symptoms, speech perception, and interference in sound localization with the type of noise exposure (environmental versus occupational) comparisons found no significant differences.CONCLUSION: Studied group's high prevalence of tinnitus, major difficulties in speech recognition with hearing loss and the presence of individuals with normal hearing with both types of exposure justify the importance of measures in health promotion, prevention, and hearing surveillance. The findings highlight the importance of valuing the patients' own perception as the first indication of tinnitus and hearing loss in order to help develop appropriate public policies within the Unified National Health System (SUS)."
"23257587","The use of the kurtosis metric in the evaluation of occupational hearing loss in workers in China: implications for hearing risk assessment.","This study examined: (1) the value of using the statistical metric, kurtosis [ß(t)], along with an energy metric to determine the hazard to hearing from high level industrial noise environments, and (2) the accuracy of the International Standard Organization (ISO-1999:1990) model for median noise-induced permanent threshold shift (NIPTS) estimates with actual recent epidemiological data obtained on 240 highly screened workers exposed to high-level industrial noise in China. A cross-sectional approach was used in this study. Shift-long temporal waveforms of the noise that workers were exposed to for evaluation of noise exposures and audiometric threshold measures were obtained on all selected subjects. The subjects were exposed to only one occupational noise exposure without the use of hearing protection devices. The results suggest that: (1) the kurtosis metric is an important variable in determining the hazards to hearing posed by a high-level industrial noise environment for hearing conservation purposes, i.e., the kurtosis differentiated between the hazardous effects produced by Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise environments, (2) the ISO-1999 predictive model does not accurately estimate the degree of median NIPTS incurred to high level kurtosis industrial noise, and (3) the inherent large variability in NIPTS among subjects emphasize the need to develop and analyze a larger database of workers with well-documented exposures to better understand the effect of kurtosis on NIPTS incurred from high level industrial noise exposures. A better understanding of the role of the kurtosis metric may lead to its incorporation into a new generation of more predictive hearing risk assessment for occupational noise exposure."
"23257585","Open-plan office noise: the susceptibility and suitability of different cognitive tasks for work in the presence of irrelevant speech.","The aim of the present study was to test which tasks are suitable for work in open-plan offices according to how susceptible they are to disruption produced by the mere presence of irrelevant speech. The tasks were chosen to tap fundamental capacities of office work involving: search for relevant information, remembering material, counting, and generation of words. The hypothesis was that tasks requiring semantic processing should be impaired by irrelevant speech. To determine the magnitude of performance decrease, two sound conditions (quiet, irrelevant speech) were compared. The results showed that tasks based on episodic short-term-memory and rehearsal of the presented material were more sensitive to disruption by irrelevant speech than tasks which did not require rehearsal or were based on long-term memory retrieval. The present study points to the inappropriateness of tasks, such as information search and remembering of material, for work environments within which irrelevant speech is ubiquitous."
"23257577","Noise-induced hearing loss.","Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) still remains a problem in developed countries, despite reduced occupational noise exposure, strict standards for hearing protection and extensive public health awareness campaigns. Therefore NIHL continues to be the focus of noise research activities. This paper summarizes progress achieved recently in our knowledge of NIHL. It includes papers published between the years 2008-2011 (in English), which were identified by a literature search of accessible medical and other relevant databases. A substantial part of this research has been concerned with the risk of NIHL in the entertainment sector, particularly in professional, orchestral musicians. There are also constant concerns regarding noise exposure and hearing risk in &quot;hard to control&quot; occupations, such as farming and construction work. Although occupational noise has decreased since the early 1980s, the number of young people subject to social noise exposure has tripled. If the exposure limits from the Noise at Work Regulations are applied, discotheque music, rock concerts, as well as music from personal music players are associated with the risk of hearing loss in teenagers and young adults. Several recent research studies have increased the understanding of the pathomechanisms of acoustic trauma, the genetics of NIHL, as well as possible dietary and pharmacologic otoprotection in acoustic trauma. The results of these studies are very promising and offer grounds to expect that targeted therapies might help prevent the loss of sensory hair cells and protect the hearing of noise-exposed individuals. These studies emphasize the need to launch an improved noise exposure policy for hearing protection along with developing more efficient norms of NIHL risk assessment."
"23207014","Contribution of genetic factors to noise-induced hearing loss: a human studies review.","Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a complex disease that results from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Over the last 10 years there has been a great increase in association studies trying to identify the susceptibility genes for NIHL in humans. They were conducted based on the candidate gene approach and comprised predominantly the group of oxidative stress genes, inner ear potassium recycling pathway genes and monogenic deafness genes, as well as other genes. So far, the most promising results were obtained for two genes encoding potassium ion channels (KCNQ4 and KCNE1), catalase (CAT), protocadherin 15 (PCDH15), myosin 14 (MYH14) and heat shock protein (HSP70), because they were replicated in two (Polish and Swedish) or three (Polish, Swedish and Chinese) populations, and were sufficient in size to yield high power for the detection of a causative allele. Today, the development of high-throughput genotyping methods allows the detection of hundreds and thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a single array which undoubtedly will lead toward identification of new NIHL susceptibility genes. This in turn will contribute to the development of genetics tests that would allow for better protection of noise-exposed individuals and personalized treatment, if necessary."

We investigated whether Lynx pilots demonstrated changes to hearing thresholds that differed from Apache pilots.METHODS: Survey responses were combined with audiometric data from a retrospective cohort of 59 Lynx and 87 Apache pilots. Subjects' audiograms were analyzed for air conduction thresholds with age correction performed in accordance with ISO 7029. Annual changes in low frequencies (0.5-2 kHz) and high frequencies (3-6 kHz) were calculated. Subjects were categorized for time in service and flying hours.RESULTS: Hearing was better than predicted at nearly all frequencies in both ears for Lynx and Apache pilots. There were no differences in hearing between groups of pilots. Significant differences in hearing threshold changes existed for pilots with 20 or more years of service compared to those in other categories.DISCUSSION: The results suggest that the circumaural earmuffs currently incorporated into the flying helmet mitigate the risk of noise-induced hearing loss in these pilots."

This paper presents the assessment of the operator's exposure to audible and infrasonic noise in 32 selected modern wheeled agricultural tractors designed and produced by world-renowned companies in normal working conditions. The tractors have been in use for no longer than 4 years, with rated power of 51 kW to up to 228 kW (as per 97/68 EC). Audible and infrasonic noise level measurements and occupational exposure analysis to noise were performed according to ISO 9612:2009 (strategy 1 - task-based measurements). The measurements were made in different typical work conditions inside and outside of tractors cabs. The results indicated that exposure levels to noise perceived by the operators (L(ex,Te) between 62,3 and 84,7 dB-A) and can make a small risk of potential adversely effects on hearing during tasks performed inside the closed cab. It should be remarked that uncertainty interval is wider and in in some conditions can occur transgression of audible noise occupational exposure limits. The measured audible noise levels can potentially develop the non-auditory effects. Analysed tractors emit considerable infrasonic noise levels that tend to exceed the occupational exposure limits (both inside and outside the driver's cab). The levels of infrasound: 83,8-111,4 dB-G. All tractors introduced for sale should be subjected to tests in terms of infrasonic noise levels. The applicable standards for low frequency noise and its measurement methods for vehicles, including agricultural tractors, should be scientifically revised. In the last years there has been a noticeable technical progress in reduction of audible noise exposure at the tractors operators workplaces with simultaneously lack of important works for limitation of exposure to infrasound.

The thresholds of higher frequency band, 3 kHz and 4 kHz were compared with the threshold of ABR. The thresholds of auditory frequency ban and 0.5 kHz were compared with the threshold of 40 Hz AERP.RESULTS: A better correlation was found between thresholds of ABR and higher frequency pure tone audiometry. There was a significant difference of thresholds between 40 kHz AERP and pure tone audiometry. The correction values of thresholds between 40 kHz AERP and pure tone audiometry in the light noise-induced hearing impairment group and the moderate noise-induced hearing impairment group were (16.43 ± 1.08) and (11.80 ± 1.12) dBn HL, respectively.CONCLUSION: In diagnosis of occupational noise-induced hearing impairment, the threshold of ABR can be used to estimate the hearing threshold of pure noise higher frequency. Because there is the significant difference of the thresholds between pure tone audiometry and 40 Hz AERP, the response threshold can not be served as the audiometry threshold, and the behavioral hearing thresholds can only be obtained by adjusting the response threshold with respective correction value."

The major industries in India are based on manufacturing. There are appreciable numbers of casting and forging units spread across the country. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of permanent hearing threshold shift among the workers engaged in Indian iron and steel small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and compared with control group subjects. As a part of hearing protection intervention, audiometric tests were conducted at low (250-1000 Hz), medium (1500-3000 Hz), and high (4000-8000 Hz) frequencies. The occurrence of hearing loss was determined based on hearing threshold levels with a low fence of 25 dB. Comparisons were made for hearing threshold at different frequencies between the exposed and control groups using Student's t test. ANOVA was used for the comparison of hearing threshold dB at different frequencies among occupation and year of experience. A P value &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All data were presented as mean value (SD). Over 90% of workers engaged in various processes of casting and forging industry showed hearing loss in the noise-sensitive medium and higher frequencies. Occupation was significantly associated with NIHL, and hearing loss was particularly high among the workers of forging section. The analyses revealed a higher prevalence of significant hearing loss among the forging workers compared to the workers associated with other activities. The study shows alarming signals of NIHL, especially in forging workers. The occupational exposure to noise could be minimized by efficient control measures through engineering controls, administrative controls, and the use of personal protective devices. Applications of engineering and/or administrative controls are frequently not feasible in the developing countries for technical and financial reasons. A complete hearing conservation programme, including training, audiometry, job rotation, and the use of hearing protection devices, is the most feasible method for the protection of industrial workers from prevailing noise in workplace environments in the developing countries."

The hREAT and F-MIRE NA values were measured by a Rion AG-20A and a 3M E-A-Rfit, respectively.RESULTS: The NA values could not be measured by hREAT for four workers (hREAT-group). The mean NA of the earplugs for subjects for whom hREAT measurements were possible (hREAT+ group) was 26.0 ± 10.0 dB. The NA of the earplugs could be measured for all subjects using F-MIRE, and the NAs of the hREAT- and hREAT+ groups were 9.5 ± 8.7 and 21.0 ± 7.3 dB. The mean HTL value at 500 Hz to 2 kHz was 45.8 ± 3.1 dB for the hREAT- group, which was significantly lower than the value for the hREAT+ group, 18.0 ± 8.6 dB.CONCLUSION: Because there is a difference between the NA values obtained by hREAT and F-MIRE, it may be necessary to compensate for this difference. In addition, workers with hearing loss and the length of the measurement time need to be taken into consideration. Finally the F-MIRE method may be useful for educating workers about using earplugs in noisy workplaces."

"22582554","Hearing loss and contributing factors among airport workers in Malaysia.","Sensorineural hearing loss is a common and important source of disability among the workers and often caused by occupational noise exposure. Aims of the study were to determine the prevalence and contributing factors of hearing loss among airport workers. A cross-sectional study was carried out at an airport in Malaysia. This study used stratified sampling method that involved 358 workers who were working in 3 different units between November 2008 and March 2009. Data for this study were collected by using questionnaires eliciting sociodemographic, occupational exposure history (previous and present), life-style including smoking habits and health-related data. Otoscopic and pure-tone audiometric tests were conducted for hearing assessment. Noise exposure status was categorize by using a noise logging dosimeter to obtain 8-hour Time-Weighted Average (TWA). Data was analyzed by using SPSS version 12.0.1 and EpiInfo 6.04. The prevalence of hearing loss was 33.5%. Age &gt;40 years old (aOR 4.3, 95%CI 2.2-8.3) is the main risk factors for hearing loss followed by duration of noise exposure &gt;5 years (aOR 2.5, 95%CI 1.4-4.7), smoking (aOR 2.1, 95%CI 1.2-3.4), duration of service &gt;5 years (aOR 2.1, 95%CI 1.1-3.9), exposure to explosion (aOR 6.1, 95%CI 1.3-29.8), exposure to vibration (aOR 2.2, 95%CI 1.1-4.3) and working in engineering unit (aOR 5.9, 95%CI 1.1-30.9). The prevalence rate ratio of hearing loss for nonsmokers aged 40 years old and younger, smokers aged 40 years old and younger, non-smokers older than 40 years old and smokers older than 40 years old was 1.0, 1.7, 2.8 and 4.6 respectively. This result contributes towards better understanding of risk factors for hearing loss, which is relatively common among Malaysian workers."
"22569474","Cardiovascular risk in rotogravure industry.","OBJECTIVE: To verify whether the occupational hazards in the rotogravure industry can be associated with cardiovascular effects.METHODS: We evaluated cardiovascular parameters and audiometric tests and analyzed noise, solvents, and shift work in 44 exposed and 44 unexposed workers.RESULTS: Unlike unexposed workers, the rotogravure workers showed significant increase of mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) values (P = 0.019; P = 0.003), higher frequency of hypertension (P = 0.002) and electrocardiographic abnormalities (P = 0.0001), significant reduction or no variation of BP response to orthostatism (P = 0.0001), and association between high levels of noise and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.0067). Subjects with hearing loss showed high frequency of hypertension and a reduction or no variation of BP response to orthostatism (both P = 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Data obtained suggest that these are the effects on the cardiovascular system of rotogravure workers who are exposed to noise."
"22568995","The effect of noise exposure on the cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential.","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of noise exposure on the cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP) in individuals with asymmetric noise-induced sensorineural hearing loss (NIHL).DESIGN: A cross-sectional observational study was used to compare cVEMP characteristics in 43 individuals with a history of noise exposure greater in one ear (e.g., the left ear of a right-handed rifle shooter) and asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss consistent with the history of noise exposure and in 14 age-matched controls. The characteristics of hearing loss were examined further for the noise-exposed participants with abnormal cVEMPs and the noise-exposed participants with normal cVEMPs.RESULTS: Thirty-three percent of the noise-exposed participants had abnormal cVEMPs, whereas cVEMPs were present and symmetrical in 100% of the age-matched controls, and cVEMP threshold was greater in the noise-exposed group than in the control group. Abnormal cVEMPs occurred most often in the ears with poorer hearing (or greater NIHL), and the noise-exposed participants who had abnormal cVEMPs had poorer high-frequency pure-tone thresholds (greater NIHL) and greater interaural high-frequency pure-tone threshold differences than the noise-exposed participants with normal cVEMPs.CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with previous studies that suggest that the sacculocollic pathway may be susceptible to noise-related damage. There is emerging evidence that the severity of NIHL is associated with the presence or absence of cVEMPs."
"22548779","Noise-induced hearing loss and associated factors among vector control workers in a Malaysian state.","This study aims to determine the prevalence and associated factors of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) among vector control workers in the state of Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. This was an analytical cross-sectional study conducted on 181 vector control workers who were working in district health offices in a state in Malaysia. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire and audiometry. Prevalence of NIHL was 26% among this group of workers. NIHL was significantly associated with the age-group of 40 years and older, length of service of 10 or more years, current occupational noise exposure, listening to loud music, history of firearms use, and history of mumps/measles infection. Following logistic regression, age of more than 40 years and noise exposure in current occupation were associated with NIHL with an odds ratio of 3.45 (95% confidence interval = 1.68-7.07) and 6.87 (95% confidence interval = 1.54-30.69), respectively, among this group of vector control workers."

However, some background music in the work environment can increase worker satisfaction and productivity. This study compared how music with, and without, lyrics affects human attention.PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and two participants, aged 20-24 years, were recruited into this study. Fifty-six males and 46 females participated in this study.METHODS: Background music with, and without lyrics, was tested for effects on listener concentration in attention testing using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) study.RESULTS: The comparison results revealed that background music with lyrics had significant negative effects on concentration and attention.CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that, if background music is played in the work environment, music without lyrics is preferable because songs with lyrics are likely to reduce worker attention and performance."
"22517306","Early occupational hearing loss of workers in a stone crushing industry: our experience in a developing country.","Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is an irreversible sensorineural hearing loss associated with exposure to high levels of excessive noise. This paper aims to assess the prevalence of early NIHL and the awareness of the effects of noise on health among stone crushing industry workers. This was a comparative cross-sectional study in Ghana of 140 workers from the stone crushing industry compared with a control group of 150 health workers. The stone workers and controls were evaluated using a structured questionnaire, which assessed symptoms of hearing loss, tinnitus, knowledge on the health hazards associated with work in noisy environment and the use of hearing protective device. Pure tone audiometric assessment was carried out for stone workers and controls. Noise levels at the work stations of the stone workers and of the controls were measured. Statistical Analysis of data was carried out using SPSS package version 16. The mean age of stone workers and controls was 42.58±7.85 and 42.19±12 years, respectively. Subjective hearing loss occurred in 21.5% of the workers and in 2.8% of the controls. Tinnitus occurred in 26.9% of stone workers and 21.5% of controls, while 87.5% stone workers had sound knowledge on the health hazards of a noisy environment. Early NIHL in the left ear occurred in 19.3% of the stone workers compared with 0.7% in controls and in the right ear, it occurred in 14.3% of the stone workers and in 1.3% of the controls; P&lt;0.005. In conclusion, the prevalence rate of early NIHL among stone crushing workers is about 19.3% for the left ear and 14.3% for the right ear."
"22513929","Interventions to promote the wearing of hearing protection.","BACKGROUND: This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 2, 2006 and previously updated in 2009.Noise-induced hearing loss can be prevented by eliminating or lowering noise exposure levels. Where the source of the noise cannot be eliminated, workers have to rely on hearing protection equipment. Several trials have been conducted to study the effectiveness of interventions to influence the wearing of hearing protection.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to enhance the wearing of hearing protection among persons regularly exposed to high noise levels.SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 1); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 8 April 2011.SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies if they had a randomised design, if they were among noise exposed (&gt; 80 dB(A)) persons, if they included an intervention to promote the wearing of hearing protection (compared to another intervention or no intervention), and if the outcome measured was the amount of use of hearing protection or a proxy measure thereof.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors selected relevant trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.MAIN RESULTS: Seven studies, involving 4670 participants, were included.A computer-based intervention lasting 30 minutes, tailored to the risk of an individual worker, was not found to be more effective than a video providing general information among workers, around 80% of whom already used hearing protection.A four-year school-based hearing loss prevention programme found that the intervention group was twice as likely to wear some kind of hearing protection as the control group that received a baseline hearing test and two additional tests at years two and three.We conducted two meta-analyses for the comparisons 'tailored strategy (the use of communication or other types of interventions that are specific to an individual or a group and aim to change behaviour) versus non-tailored strategy' and 'tailored strategy versus a commercial video on the use of hearing protection' to look at mean percentage use of hearing protective devices (HPDs), that showed improvement in the mean use of HPDs for the tailored group. A meta-analysis of the comparison 'mixed interventions' (classroom instruction, distribution of HPDs, mailings, noise level assessments and audiometric testing) versus control (audiometric testing alone) also showed improvement in self reported use of HPDs when shooting firearms.Tailored education showed an improvement in HPD use of 8.3% versus targeted education (6.1%).AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence found in this review shows that some interventions improve the mean use of hearing protection devices compared to non-intervention. Future trials should have standard outcomes and interventions to allow the combining of results in meta-analysis."
"22492021","Sunlight exposure may be a risk factor of hearing impairment: a community-based study in Japanese older men and women.","BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress is an important factor in the pathology of age-related hearing loss. Recent animal studies have reported that ultraviolet radiation in sunlight is related to systemic induction of oxidative stress. Chronic sun exposure leads to photodamaged skin, which is manifested as facial skin wrinkling and hyperpigmentation. We hypothesized that sunlight exposure, as assessed by the severity of facial skin photodamage, might be associated with hearing impairment through an oxidative stress mechanism. To examine this, we performed a cross-sectional analysis by using the baseline data from a community-based cohort study of older Japanese.METHODS: A total of 805 residents (342 men and 463 women) aged 65 years or older living in Kurabuchi Town, Gunma prefecture, Japan, were examined between 2005 and 2006. Facial skin condition was quantified by image analysis of standardized facial images. Hearing impairment was defined as a failure to hear a 30-dB signal at 1 kHz and a 40-dB signal at 4 kHz in the better ear in pure-tone audiometric tests.RESULTS: In men, facial wrinkle was positively associated with hearing impairment (for highest vs lowest: multivariate-adjusted odds ratio, 2.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-4.66; p for trend = .01). Stratified analysis by age, educational level, smoking status, sunscreen or foundation use, and diabetes showed results similar to those for men as a whole. This association was particularly pronounced in men with the low levels of antioxidants and without occupational noise exposure. We observed no apparent association in women.CONCLUSIONS: The results support the hypothesis that chronic sun exposure is a risk factor of hearing impairment."
"22436020","Overall versus individual changes for otoacoustic emissions and audiometry in a noise-exposed cohort.","OBJECTIVE: For a noise-exposed group of workers, group-averaged and individual changes were compared for pure-tone audiometry, transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs), and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) in order to see if they exhibit the same pattern in time.DESIGN: Baseline and 17-months follow-up hearing status was examined with pure-tone audiometry, TEOAEs, and DPOAEs.STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 233 noise-exposed employees were measured, while 60 subjects from this group contributed to test-retest reliability measures.RESULTS: Group-averaged changes and individual shifts followed similar patterns: decreases for audiometry at 6-8 kHz and DPOAE at 1.5 kHz, and enhancements for DPOAE at 3 kHz. TEOAEs showed an overall deterioration while both individual deteriorations and enhancements were larger than chance. DPOAE at 6 kHz showed the largest group-averaged change, while the number of individual shifts was not significant. There were no clear relations between changes in audiometry and changes in OAE.CONCLUSION: Significant individual OAE changes do not necessarily follow the same pattern as the group-averaged results. This limits the applicability of OAE testing for the monitoring of individual subjects. Furthermore, hearing deterioration might manifest itself in a local enhancement of otoacoustic emissions and not only in the form of decreases in amplitude."
"22387711","Validation of a questionnaire to identify hearing loss among farm operators.","Workers in certain industries (e.g., agriculture) do not participate in a hearing conservation program and rarely receive this important preventive care. The National Institute for Deafness and Communication Disorders (NIDCD) has published a questionnaire to assess a person's need for medical examination of their hearing. The use of a self-administered questionnaire may pose a simple, low cost opportunity to assess the hearing health of workers not included in a hearing conservation program. However, the validity of the NIDCD questionnaire has not been tested. A study was conducted to compare the results of audiometric screening and the NIDCD questionnaire in identifying persons at risk for hearing impairment who may benefit from a medical referral. Data were collected from 103 farm operators at a regional farm show. Receiver-operator characteristic curves, measuring the ability of the questionnaire to correctly classify those with and without the disease suggested that the level of performance of the questionnaire as a whole, ranged from 0.74 to 0.69 (fair to poor). However, selected questionnaire items (e.g., Do you have to strain to understand conversations?) had moderate agreement (0.38 to 0.41) with screening audiogram results. Overall, the 10-item instrument did not perform as well as instruments with fewer items reported in separate studies. These findings suggest that, while less desirable than audiometry, alternative self-administered instruments might perform the better in this group. This approach may be useful as an alternative screening method to detect risk of hearing loss and identifying the need for medical evaluation of hearing sensitivity, particularly among farm operators."
"22387709","Tracking occupational hearing loss across global industries: a comparative analysis of metrics.","Occupational hearing loss is one of the most prevalent occupational conditions; yet, there is no acknowledged international metric to allow comparisons of risk between different industries and regions. In order to make recommendations for an international standard of occupational hearing loss, members of an international industry group (the International Aluminium Association) submitted details of different hearing loss metrics currently in use by members. We compared the performance of these metrics using an audiometric data set for over 6000 individuals working in 10 locations of one member company. We calculated rates for each metric at each location from 2002 to 2006. For comparison, we calculated the difference of observed-expected (for age) binaural high-frequency hearing loss (in dB/year) for each location over the same time period. We performed linear regression to determine the correlation between each metric and the observed-expected rate of hearing loss. The different metrics produced discrepant results, with annual rates ranging from 0.0% for a less-sensitive metric to more than 10% for a highly sensitive metric. At least two metrics, a 10dB age-corrected threshold shift from baseline and a 15dB nonage-corrected shift metric, correlated well with the difference of observed-expected high-frequency hearing loss. This study suggests that it is feasible to develop an international standard for tracking occupational hearing loss in industrial working populations."
"22387708","Validity of hearing impairment calculation methods for prediction of self-reported hearing handicap.","Worker's compensation for hearing loss caused by occupational noise exposure is calculated by varying methods, from state to state within the United States (US), with many employing arithmetic formulas based on the pure-tone audiogram, to quantify hearing loss. Several assumptions unsupported or weakly supported by empirical data underlie these formulas. The present study evaluated the ability of various arithmetic hearing impairment calculations to predict a self-reported hearing handicap in a sample of presenting with sensorineural hearing loss. 204 adults (127 male, 77 female) ranging in age from 18 to 94 served as participants. The sample was selected to exclude patients who had been referred for hearing testing for a medicolegal examination or a hearing conservation appointment. A hearing handicap was measured by the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults/for the Elderly (HHIA/E). The covariance analysis of linear structural equations was used to assess the relative strength of correlation with the HHIA/E score among the six formulas and various forms of pure-tone average. The results revealed that all the hearing impairment calculations examined were significantly, but weakly, correlated with the self-reported hearing impairment scores. No significant differences among the predictive abilities of the impairment calculations were evident; however, the average binaural impairment assigned differed significantly among the six calculations examined. Individuals who demonstrated 0% impairment had significantly lower (i.e., better) HHIA/E scores compared to those with non-zero impairment for each formula. These results supported the idea that audiometric data provided an insufficient explanation for real-world hearing difficulties."
"22387707","Audiological and electrophysiological assessment of professional pop/rock musicians.","In the present study, we evaluated peripheral and central auditory pathways in professional musicians (with and without hearing loss) compared to non-musicians. The goal was to verify if music exposure could affect auditory pathways as a whole. This is a prospective study that compared the results obtained between three groups (musicians with and without hearing loss and non-musicians). Thirty-two male individuals participated and they were assessed by: Immittance measurements, pure-tone air conduction thresholds at all frequencies from 0.25 to 20 kHz, Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions, Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR), and Cognitive Potential. The musicians showed worse hearing thresholds in both conventional and high frequency audiometry when compared to the non-musicians; the mean amplitude of Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions was smaller in the musicians group, but the mean latencies of Auditory Brainstem Response and Cognitive Potential were diminished in the musicians when compared to the non-musicians. Our findings suggest that the population of musicians is at risk for developing music-induced hearing loss. However, the electrophysiological evaluation showed that latency waves of ABR and P300 were diminished in musicians, which may suggest that the auditory training to which these musicians are exposed acts as a facilitator of the acoustic signal transmission to the cortex."

The purposes of this study were to determine the intensity and frequency components of dental instruments used by dental staff nurses and the prevalence of noise induced hearing loss.METHODOLOGY: We performed a comparative, cross sectional study on a group of dental staff nurses. Participants underwent ear examination followed by pure tone audiometry. Pure tone audiometry was performed at least 48 hours after the participants were free from noise exposure. Noise induced hearing loss was defined as failed definitive threshold at a frequency of 4000 Hz greater than 20 dB. The intensity level, noise spectrum, and frequency of hand piece, saliva suction, and scaler were recorded during the dental procedure.RESULTS: A total of 65 dental staff nurses were included. The mean intensity of hand pieces, scalers, and saliva suctions were 88.7 (SD2.2), 87.1 (SD2.6), and 77.4 (SD6.3) dBA while their most prominent frequencies were 3880, 7997, and 3513 Hz, respectively. Three of the subjects had slightly more than 20 dB hearing loss at 4 kHz on audiogram; all were affected unilaterally. These three individuals worked as dental nurses for 11, 13, and 21 years, respectively. Therefore, the prevalence of noise induced hearing loss was 5.0% (95% CI: -1.0%, 10.0%).CONCLUSIONS: Dental staff nurses might have an increased risk of noise induced hearing loss, depending upon individual factors influencing susceptibility and duration of noise exposure."
"22326290","Relative risk of elevated hearing threshold compared to ISO1999 normative populations for Royal Australian Air Force male personnel.","OBJECTIVE: This paper introduces a new method to calculate relative risks of elevated hearing thresholds, at various ages and frequencies, between a study population and ISO1999:2003: Annex A Screened, Annex B Unscreened and ISO1999 Section 5.3 adjustment for noise exposure using Annex A Screened data. We demonstrate this method on a study population of male Royal Australian Air Force personnel.STUDY DESIGN: Using a retrospective cohort design, hearing thresholds were assessed in 583 F-111 aircraft maintenance personnel, 377 technical-trade comparisons and 492 non-technical comparisons using pure-tone audiometry. A quantile regression model was used determine whether an association exists between median hearing thresholds and F-111 maintenance, adjusting for possible confounders. The new method involves using quantile regression models with bootstrapped standard errors to estimate percentiles for the study population and thus determine the probability of a greater than 25 dB hearing threshold. This was done for the three ISO datasets as follows; for the ISO1999 Annex A screened population data the formula provided allows the calculation of these probabilities. ISO1999 Annex B unscreened population data only provides the values for the 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles at ages 30, 40, 50 and 60 only, therefore it was necessary to fit a curve to these values in order to estimate the probabilities. For ISO1999 Section 5.3 adjustment for noise exposure population we used the Annex A screened population data plus the formula. The probabilities were then divided to give the relative risks of a greater than 25 dB hearing threshold, at various ages and frequencies.RESULTS: While no difference was observed between the three groups, the model identified a number of significant confounders, namely tinnitus, smoking, diabetes and the use of anti-depressant medications. Relative risks were high at frequencies 2 kHz and less for the study population of all ages compared to ISO A screened data. The increased relative risks at 4 and 6 kHz give the appearance of a &quot;noise notch&quot; for ages 30 and 40 years. The comparison with the ISO B unscreened data are significantly less than one for frequencies above 2 kHz, particularly for young men and greater than one less than 2 kHz. The relative risks for the comparison to the ISO A screened data with ISO 5.3 adjustments, are highest for young men decreasing with age, with the highest relative risk are at frequencies less than 2 kHz.CONCLUSIONS: This paper demonstrates a new method for quantifying the probability of a clinically relevant hearing loss and the relative risk of the loss due to a risk factor. Prior to this, researchers were reduced to simplistic methods such as visual comparison of deciles which did not enable the estimation of risk. The new method can use all observed hearing thresholds per study participant, adjust for known confounding factors such age and gender, and calculate the relative risk of a clinically relevant increase in hearing threshold due to a risk factor of interest."

The aim of this study was to verify the efficiency of the Monitor of Hearing In Ear regarding prevention of the hearing loss in the activity realized by musicians. This study justifies by the need to verify a possible method of protection for these professionals. It was analyzed a group of 10 musicians of a band of dance of Santa Catarina. The methods of research were questionnaires, audiometry and analysis of the technical specifications of Monitors of Hearing In Ear. The population investigated are aged between 18-56, and time in the profession between 37 and 0,4 years. The exhibition is of, roughly, 12 hours a week during the presentations, 4,5 hours a week rehearsing in group and from 1 to 8 weekly hours of isolated rehearsal. It was observed that 40% of the population presented normal hearing thresholds for left and right ear, the sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear was ascertained in 40% and 20% presented sensorineural hearing loss in both ears. The advantage of the Monitor of Hearing In Ear is that there is the blocking of the undesirable sounds, making possible a greater audible reduction, generally between 25 and 40 dB, showing possibility to be considered a half of protection for professional musicians."
"22284753","Hearing effects from intermittent and continuous noise exposure in a study of Korean factory workers and firefighters.","BACKGROUND: South Korea and surrounding countries in East Asia are believed to have the highest proportion in the world of high frequency hearing loss due to occupational noise exposure, yet there has been limited information published in international journals, and limited information for control of noise in local workplaces beyond strategies from western countries. We exploit medical surveillance information from two worker groups to enhance local knowledge about noise-induced hearing loss and explore the possible importance of shift work to risk.METHODS: Four-years of hearing data were evaluated for 81 male farm machine factory workers and 371 male firefighters who had successfully completed a health examination and questionnaires for the duration of the study period. The averages of hearing thresholds at 2, 3, and 4 kHz were used as the primary end-point for comparison. Repeat measure analysis adjusted for age, exposure duration and smoking status was used to measure the difference in hearing threshold between the two groups.RESULTS: Noise levels were measured in the factory at a mean of 82 dBA, with a range of 66-97. No concurrent measurements were taken for the firefighters, but historic comparison values showed a wider range but a similar mean of 76-79 dBA. Although losses during follow-up were negligible, the factory workers had significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) more hearing loss at the baseline of the study than the firefighters in both ears at 2, 3, and 4 kHz, adjusted for age, duration of employment and smoking status. Among those with 10 years of employment, mean losses at these frequencies among the factory workers fell into the impairment range (&gt; 25 dB loss). Firefighters also showed increased losses associated with longer exposure duration, but these were significantly less marked. Losses at lower frequencies (&lt; or = 1 kHz) were negligible in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: Korean work environments with continuous noise exposure in the measured range should consider implementation of a hearing conservation program. Further evaluation of hearing loss in workers exposed to irregular or intermittent high noise levels, such as firefighters, is also warranted."
"22234848","[Göttingen sentence in noise for different audiogram classes].","BACKGROUND: In addition to the standardized Freiburg sentence test in silence validated speech tests in noise are available. They are mainly used to test the benefit of hearing systems in everyday-life situations. In diagnostics tests in noise can also give additional information of the patients' hearing impairment. The determined speech reception threshold (SRT) depends on the degree of hearing loss and the used speech and noise test material. Aim of this study was to analyze the results of the Göttingen sentence test in noise in relation to different audiogram classes.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Göttingen sentence test in stationary noise (65 dB) was performed for 135 patients with different degrees of hearing losses. Based on the air-conducted threshold all ears were categorized to an audiogram class by an automated procedure.RESULTS: For the mild hearing losses the results of the Göttingen sentence test increased with increasing pure-tone-average (PTA) and the values are smaller than 0 dB SNR with a small standard deviation (± 1-2 dB SNR). For the moderate hearing losses values of 5 dB SNR with a standard deviation of 6 dB SNR were achieved on average. Patients with a high hearing loss achieved values higher than 20 dB SNR.CONCLUSION: For the mild hearing losses the results were located in a small range. However, they can give important information about the patient's hearing impairment mainly appears in a noisy environment. With increasing hearing loss also the reduced hearing in silence affects the results achieved with the Göttingen sentence test in noise. Therefore the hearing in silence has to be taken into account at the interpretation of the results."
"26557334","Comparison of speech intelligibility measures for an electronic amplifying earmuff and an identical passive attenuation device.","The purpose of this study was to identify any differences between speech intelligibility measures obtained with MineEars electronic earmuffs (ProEars, Westcliffe, CO, USA) and the Bilsom model 847 (Sperian Hearing Protection, San Diego, CA, USA), which is a conventional passive-attenuation earmuff. These two devices are closely related, since the MineEars device consisted of a Bilsom 847 earmuff with the addition of electronic amplification circuits. Intelligibility scores were obtained by conducting listening tests with 15 normal-hearing human subject volunteers wearing the earmuffs. The primary research objective was to determine whether speech understanding differs between the passive earmuffs and the electronic earmuffs (with the volume control set at three different positions) in a background of 90 dB(A) continuous noise. As expected, results showed that speech intelligibility increased with higher speech-to-noise ratios; however, the electronic earmuff with the volume control set at full-on performed worse than when it was set to off or the lowest on setting. This finding suggests that the maximum volume control setting for these electronic earmuffs may not provide any benefits in terms of increased speech intelligibility in the background noise condition that was tested. Other volume control settings would need to be evaluated for their ability to produce higher speech intelligibility scores. Additionally, since an extensive electro-acoustic evaluation of the electronic earmuff was not performed as a part of this study, the exact cause of the reduced intelligibility scores at full volume remains unknown.

Routine physical examination, pulmonary function, hearing tests and nervous system test were performed in workers for 2 consecutive years. Urine lead, cadmium and mercury contents were detected. The comet assay was use to measure DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes among workers.RESULT: The main occupational hazard factors in this solid landfill are dust, harmful gas, high temperature and noise. The oxides, carbon monoxide, and noise and high temperatures in summer at some work sites exceeded the national occupational exposure limits. The prevalence of respiratory inflammation and rate of pulmonary function decrease among front-line workers and on-site technical managers are 21.2% and 11.5%, which are significantly higher than those among administrative staff (7.1% and 0) (P &lt; 0.05). Nervous system abnormalities rate of front-line workers and on-site technical managers was 50.0%, which is significantly higher than that (26.7%) of administrative staff (P &lt; 0.05). Because of long-term exposure to high intensity noice, hearing loss rate of bulldozer drivers was 10.3%. In addition, about 75% of workers with DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocyte are front-line workers.CONCLUSION: Adverse health effects from occupational hazards were observed among workers in this solid waste landfill."
"24285776","Hearing loss in Thai naval officers of coastal patrol crafts.","This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the prevalence of hearing loss and its risk factors among Thai naval officers. The subjects consisted of 149 males who were asked to complete a questionnaire. Audiometric threshold testing was performed at the audiometric frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 kHz. The noise levels and the organic solvent concentrations in the working environment were measured on a common type of gun boat. The findings revealed that 39.6% of naval officers had hearing loss. The noise level (LAeq) was 100.6 dB in the engine room. The organic solvent concentrations were less than the occupational exposure limit for organic solvents. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated 2 factors were significantly associated with hearing loss. They were age and service experience. The results suggest that the Thai navy should develop a hearing conservation program for naval officers on coastal patrol crafts."
"24237040","Exploring the sensitivity of speech-in-noise tests for noise-induced hearing loss.","OBJECTIVE: Recently, the digit triplet test was shown to be a sensitive speech-in-noise test for early high-frequency hearing loss in noise-exposed workers. This study investigates if a further improvement is achieved when using a closed set of consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) speech items with the same vowel, and/or a low-pass (LP) filtered version of the standard speech-shaped noise.DESIGN: Speech reception thresholds in noise were gathered for the digit triplet, CVC, and CVC_LP test and compared to the high-frequency pure-tone average (PTA).STUDY SAMPLE: 118 noise-exposed workers showing a wide range of high-frequency hearing losses.RESULTS: For the 84 Dutch-speaking participants, the CVC test showed an increased measurement error and a decreased between-subject variation, leading to a weaker correlation with the PTA2,3,4,6 (R = 0.64) and thus a lower sensitivity compared to the digit triplet test (R = 0.86). However, the use of LP-filtered noise resulted in a sensitivity improvement (R = 0.79 versus R = 0.64) due to the large increase in between-subject spread. Similar trends were found for the 34 French-speaking workers.CONCLUSIONS: Using CVC words with the same vowel could not increase the sensitivity to detect isolated high-frequency hearing loss. With LP-filtered noise, test sensitivity improved, but it did not surpass the original digit triplet test."
"24231423","Classroom acoustics and hearing ability as determinants for perceived social climate and intentions to stay at work.","Background noise and room acoustics may impede social interactions by interfering with oral communication and other cognitive processes. Accordingly, recent research in school environments has showed that social relationships with peers and teachers are described more negatively in rooms with long reverberation times (RT). The purpose of this study was to investigate how RT and hearing ability (i.e., hearing thresholds [HT] and distortion product oto-acoustic emissions) were associated with school teachers' perceptions of the social climate at work and their intentions to stay on the job. School teachers (n = 107) from 10 schools that worked in classrooms classified by acoustical experts as &quot;short RT&quot; (3 schools, mean RT 0.41-0.47 s), &quot;medium RT&quot; (3 schools, mean RT 0.50-0.53 s), and &quot;long RT&quot; (4 schools, mean RT 0.59-0.73 s) were examined. Teachers who worked in classrooms with long RT perceived their social climate to be more competitive, conflict laden, and less relaxed and comfortable. They were more doubtful about staying on the job. Even if the teachers were generally satisfied with their work the results suggest that the comfort at work may have been further improved by acoustical interventions that focus on reducing sound reflections in the classrooms. Yet, due the study design and the novelty of the findings the potential practical significance of our observations remains to be evaluated."
"24231421","Comparison of sound propagation and perception of three types of backup alarms with regards to worker safety.","A technology of backup alarms based on the use of a broadband signal has recently gained popularity in many countries. In this study, the performance of this broadband technology is compared to that of a conventional tonal alarm and a multi-tone alarm from a worker-safety standpoint. Field measurements of sound pressure level patterns behind heavy vehicles were performed in real work environments and psychoacoustic measurements (sound detection thresholds, equal loudness, perceived urgency and sound localization) were carried out in the laboratory with human subjects. Compared with the conventional tonal alarm, the broadband alarm generates a much more uniform sound field behind vehicles, is easier to localize in space and is judged slighter louder at representative alarm levels. Slight advantages were found with the tonal alarm for sound detection and for perceived urgency at low levels, but these benefits observed in laboratory conditions would not overcome the detrimental effects associated with the large and abrupt variations in sound pressure levels (up to 15-20 dB within short distances) observed in the field behind vehicles for this alarm, which are significantly higher than those obtained with the broadband alarm. Performance with the multi-tone alarm generally fell between that of the tonal and broadband alarms on most measures. "
"24231420","The prevalence of audiometric notches in adolescents in Germany: The Ohrkan-study.","Although there is concern about increasing hearing loss in adolescents caused by leisure noise exposure, prevalence data are scarce. In an US study, about 16-17% of adolescents were affected by audiometric notches. To estimate the prevalence of audiometric notches in adolescents in Germany, baseline data of the cohort study Ohrkan, recruitment during the school years 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 were analyzed. All students in grade 9 visiting any school in the city of Regensburg were eligible for participation. Data was collected via standardized questionnaires from students and their parents. In addition, students were asked to visit the University Clinics of Regensburg for ear examination including a tympanogram and the determination of hearing thresholds in air conduction audiometry. The prevalence of audiometric notches was determined in students with normal tympanogram in both ears and complete audiometry data. Audiometric notches were defined according to criteria used to analyse US data. Overall, 2149 students (1158 girls, 991 boys mainly aged 15-16 years) of the 3846 eligible adolescents (56%) participated. Among the 1843 adolescents with complete audiometry and tympanometry data, the prevalence of audiometric notches was 2.4% (95% confidence interval 1.7-3.1%). We could not confirm the high prevalence of audiometric notches as reported in National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys for adolescents in the US. Differences in prevalence might be at least partly due to methodical differences in audiometry. Even if empirical evidence is presently ambiguous, it is reasonable to educate young people about the potential risks of high leisure noise exposure. "
"24231416","Evaluation of the effects of exposure to organic solvents and hazardous noise among US Air Force Reserve personnel.","Hearing loss affects many workers including those in the military and may be caused by noise, medications, and chemicals. Exposures to some chemicals may lead to an increase in the incidence of hearing loss when combined with hazardous noise. This retrospective study evaluated the risk for hearing loss among Air Force Reserve personnel exposed to occupational noise with and without exposures to toluene, styrene, xylene, benzene, and JP-8 (jet fuel). Risk factors associated with hearing loss were determined using logistic and linear regression. Stratified analysis was used to evaluate potential interaction between solvent and noise exposure. The majority of the subjects were male (94.6%) and 35 years or older on the date of their first study audiogram (66%). Followed for an average of 3.2 years, 9.2% of the study subjects had hearing loss in at least one ear. Increasing age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.03 per year of age) and each year of follow-up time (OR = 1.23) were significantly associated with hearing loss. Low and moderate solvent exposures were not associated with hearing loss. Linear regression demonstrated that hearing loss was significantly associated with age at first study audiogram, length of follow-up time, and exposure to noise. Hearing decreased by 0.04 decibels for every decibel increase in noise level or by almost half a decibel (0.4 dB) for every 10 decibel increase in noise level. "
"24220478","Occupational safety threats among dental personnel and related risk factors.","Occupational diseases are primarily considered to be important health problems for individuals with occupations in heavy industry fields. Although dentists work in very clean and elegant offices, they are frequently exposed to various chemicals and high-intensity, sound-producing instruments, such as compressors and aerators. In our study, we aimed to investigate the risk for occupational hearing loss of dental personnel, by performing pure-tone audiometry in 40 dentists and comparing the results with those of healthy individuals. We also sampled the nasal mucosa to investigate the effects of occupational chemicals on the nasal mucosa of the dentists. The pure-tone audiometric thresholds at 5 different frequencies (1000, 2000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz) and working time were evaluated as potential risk factors. The pure-tone audiometric results (as decibels) at each frequency and the median values for each side (right and left ears) were significantly higher for dentists than for the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The pure-tone audiometric results did not significantly differ between the women and men in the study group (P &gt; 0.05). The findings in the nasal mucosa (goblet cell hyperplasia, neutrophil/eosinophil/basophil distribution, metaplasia, dysplasia, premalignant or malignant cells) were similar in the study and control groups (P &gt; 0.05). In conclusion, our study indicated that high-intensity, sound-producing equipment is an important occupational threat for dentists, whereas chemical agents have minimal hazardous effects. "

The results were compared with audiograms from an internal control group of railway workers and an external reference group of people not occupationally exposed to noise. The monaural hearing threshold level at 4kHz, the mean binaural value at 3, 4 and 6kHz and the prevalence of audiometric notches (=25 dB at 4kHz) were used for comparison.RESULTS: Audiograms were available for 1567 drivers, 1565 conductors, 4029 railway worker controls and 15 012 people not occupationally exposed to noise. No difference in hearing level or prevalence of audiometric notches was found between study groups after adjusting for age and gender.CONCLUSIONS: Norwegian train drivers and conductors have normal hearing threshold levels comparable with those in non-exposed groups."
"24116664","The audiological health of horn players.","Among orchestral musicians, horn players are one of the most at-risk groups for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). To investigate this group further, pure tone audiometry and a 14-item questionnaire were used to assess the hearing health, as well as attitudes and practices regarding hearing conservation, among 142 French horn players attending an international horn conference in Brisbane, Australia. Of this study's French horn players, 11.1% to 22.2%, and 17.7% to 32.9% of those aged =40 years, showed some form of hearing loss (corrected for age and gender) typical of NIHL, using conservative versus lenient criteria, respectively. Stepwise multiple regression analyses showed no obvious predictor of hearing loss in this study's participants. Of the 18% of participants who reported using hearing protection, 81% used this protection &quot;sometimes&quot; and 50% used generic, foam, or other inferior forms of protection. Continued efforts to better manage the hearing health of horn players is warranted particularly as any hearing loss will affect a horn player's ability to perform and therefore his or her livelihood. Managing the hearing health of horn players will be challenging, however, with no simple predictor of NIHL loss being identified in this study's sample."
"24114066","A longitudinal study of changes in distortion-product otoacoustic emissions and pure-tone thresholds in an industrial setting.","In a longitudinal study of 76 noise-exposed industrial workers, 34 (68 ears) of them were available for final evaluation after 9 years of observation. Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DP) at 65/55 dB SPL and pure-tone audiometry were used to detect noise-induced inner ear changes. Repeated measures analyses of variance were made on the subjects and in a control group, whereas significant threshold shifts (STS) and significant emission shifts (SES) were calculated. Both hearing thresholds and DP showed a high-frequency deterioration, but there was absence of statistical correlation between elevation of hearing thresholds and decrease of DP. There was no clear pattern between individual changes in audiometric thresholds and DP, and all combinations were present: ears with only STS, ears with only SES, ears with both STS and SES and ears with absence of STS and SES. Audiometric changes were maximal at 4 and 6 kHz and DP changes at 2 and 3 kHz. Since significant individual emission changes do not necessarily follow the same pattern as the group-averaged results, the use of DP for monitoring of individual subjects is not advised. However, its use in conjunction with audiometry in hearing conservation programs is highly recommended."

Quarries with loud deafening sounds from trucks and machineries pose the risk of noise-induced hearing loss to workers. This study was designed to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice towards noise-induced hearing loss and to determine the prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss and its associated factors among quarry workers in a north-eastern state of Malaysia.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at six quarries in a north-eastern state of Malaysia, with 97 consented respondents who answered a validated version of a questionnaire and underwent pure tone audiogram. The respondents were male, aged between 18 to 50 years, working in the quarry area for at least 6-months duration with no family history of ear diseases.RESULTS: The mean percentage scores of knowledge, attitude and practice were 44 (11), 70 (10) and 28 (16) percent, respectively. The prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss was found to be 57 (95% CI: 47, 67) with 46 (84%) having mild and moderate noise-induced hearing loss, and 34 (62%) involved both ears. Multiple logistic regressions showed that age and practice score were the associated factors with odd ratios of 1.1 (95% CI: 1.1, 1.2; p&lt;0.001) and 0.9 (95% CI: 0.8, 1.0; p=0.008), respectively.CONCLUSION: The knowledge, attitude and practice scores of the respondents were poor and the high prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss was contributed by factors such as poor practice and old age."
"24005271","[The hearing function and vegetative reactions in airport technicians using individual hearing protectors].","The objective of the present study was to evaluate the hearing function in the airport technical personnel and estimate the effectiveness of multicomponent anti-noise hearing protectors used by the specialists engaged in the aircraft maintenance. The tonal threshold audiometry was carried out before and after a shiftwork. The extra-aural effect of noise was assessed from the characteristics of cardiac rhythm variability. The study included two groups of subjects: in one of them (n=8) they used ordinary flight headsets (control) in the other the protection was ensured with the help of multi-insert hearing protectors (n=16). The initial hearing thresholds were found to be increased up to 70 and 60 dB at the frequencies of 4 and 8 kHz respectively. The regression analysis revealed the relationship between these parameters and the duration of aerodrome work experience. Temporary threshold shifts were observed only in the control group. An increase in the tone of the sympathetic nervous system was observed in the control subjects but was absent in the study group. It is concluded that the multi-component hearing protectors employed in the present study are highly efficacious anti-noise devices. The mechanisms of noise-induced hearing loss are discussed. "

The relationship between the development of the main nosological forms of somatic pathology as possible markers of internal ear diseases and professional sensorineural impairment of hearing was elucidated among the members of locomotive crews (n=224). The parameters of interest were evaluated 4 years before, within 1 year, and 4 years after the establishment of diagnosis of OSNIH. It was shown that the members of locomotive crews most frequently suffer atherosclerosis (20.0%), gastrointestinal disorders (34.8%), arterial hypertension (25.0%), osteochondrosis (largely vertebrogenic lumbodynia (21.3%)), and microcirculatory disturbances in the form of vascular spasm in the fundus of the eye (32.9%). 97.6% of the subjects above 35 years of age presented with hypercholesterolemia. Comparative analysis of the occurrence of these nosological forms among the members of locomotive crews with hearing problems on the one hand and the normally functioning organ of hearing on the other hand has demonstrated that none of these pathologies can be regarded as a marker for early diagnosis of OSNIH. At the same time, overweight even in the subjects under 35 years of age should be taken into account when planning and implementing preventive measures. "
"23976950","Noise exposure and hearing impairment among Chinese restaurant workers and entertainment employees in Hong Kong.","BACKGROUND: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a major concern in the non-manufacturing industries. This study aimed to investigate the occupational noise exposure and the NIHL among Chinese restaurant workers and entertainment employees working in the service industry in Hong Kong.METHODS: This cross-sectional survey involved a total of 1,670 participants. Among them, 937 were randomly selected from the workers of Chinese restaurants and 733 were selected from workers in three entertainment sectors: radio and television stations; cultural performance halls or auditoria of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD); and karaoke bars. Noise exposure levels were measured in the sampled restaurants and entertainment sectors. Each participant received an audiometric screening test. Those who were found to have abnormalities were required to take another diagnostic test in the health center. The &quot;Klockhoff digit&quot; method was used to classify NIHL in the present study.RESULTS: The main source of noise inside restaurants was the stoves. The mean hearing thresholds showed a typical dip at 3 to 6 KHz and a substantial proportion (23.7%) of the workers fulfilled the criteria for presumptive NIHL. For entertainment sectors, employees in radio and television stations generally had higher exposure levels than those in the halls or auditoria of the LCSD and karaoke bars. The mean hearing thresholds showed a typical dip at 6 KHz and a substantial proportion of the employees fulfilled the criteria for presumptive NIHL (38.6%, 95%CI: 35.1-42.1%). Being male, older, and having longer service and daily alcohol consumption were associated with noise-induced hearing impairment both in restaurant workers and entertainment employees.CONCLUSION: Excessive noise exposure is common in the Chinese restaurant and entertainment industries and a substantial proportion of restaurant workers and entertainment employees suffer from NIHL. Comprehensive hearing conservation programs should be introduced to the service industry in Hong Kong."

Hearing and neurobehavioral functions were evaluated. Serum neurotransmitters were also determined.RESULTS: The prevalence of hearing loss was much higher in petrochemical groups than that in power station and control groups (P &lt; 0.05). Compared with the control group, scores of neurobehavioral function reflecting learning and memory were decreased in petrochemical workers (P &lt; 0.05), as well as acetylcholinesterase activity. Negative correlation was shown between neurobehavioral function and acetylcholinesterase.CONCLUSIONS: Ethylbenzene exposure might be associated with hearing loss, neurobehavioral function impairment, and imbalance of neurotransmitters."
"23959686","Audible and infrasonic noise levels in the cabins of modern agricultural tractors--does the risk of adverse, exposure-dependent effects still exist?","INTRODUCTION: The agricultural tractor is one of the most commonly used vehicles on farms and one of the most prominent sources of noise. This article presents an exemplary assessment of the audible and infrasonic noise levels in the cabins of selected modern wheeled agricultural tractors.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Operator-perceived audible and infrasonic noise levels in the cabins were examined for 20 types of modern tractors during typical conditions of work. The tractors had been in use for no longer than 3 years, with rated power between 96 kW and 227 kW, designed and produced by world-renowned companies. Noise level measurements were performed in accordance with PN-EN ISO 9612:2011 (ISO 9612:2009).RESULTS: Audible noise levels (A-weighted) ranged from 62.1 to 87.4 dB-A (average: 68.2 to 83.8 dB-A) for different work tasks. The factors influencing noise levels include performed tasks, soil, weather conditions and the skills of individual drivers. In spectrum analysis, the highest noise levels occurred at frequencies 250 Hz, 1 and 2 kHz. Infrasound noise levels (G-weighted) ranged from 87.3 to 111.3 dB-G. The driver-experienced exposure to infrasound was found to increase significantly when the vehicle was in motion.CONCLUSIONS: Average audible noise levels have no potential to adversely affect the hearing organ during tasks performed inside the closed cabins of the analysed modern agricultural tractors. Due to the relatively low audible noise levels inside the cabins of modern agricultural tractors, non-auditory effects are the only adverse symptoms that can develop. Modern agricultural tractors emit considerable infrasonic noise levels. All tractors introduced into the market should be subjected to tests with regard to infrasonic noise levels."

The left ear showed significantly poorer hearing than the right ear. Firefighters having longer years of work in fire services demonstrated significantly worse hearing. Reported use of HPDs was 34% of the time that was needed. Firefighters who used HPDs less were significantly more likely to have hearing loss.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a considerable NIHL problem and low use of HPDs in firefighters. More comprehensive hearing conservation programs should be implemented to reduce NIHL for firefighters."
"23879065","[Measurement of real personal noise attenuation using earplugs with the E-A-Rfit system].","BACKGROUND: The assessment of efficiency of hearing protection devices (HPDs), conducted above statutory limits, must be made using a standardized method while devices are worn; however, standardized and suitable laboratory conditions are difficult to encounter at the workplace. To overcome this problem, there are methods of measurement at the workplace such as &quot;field-microphone-in-real-ear&quot; (F-MIRE).OBJECTIVES: The study was concerned with the measurement of real noise attenuation using earplugs and a new evaluation system: we checked the difference between &quot;real&quot; attenuation (at workplace) and &quot;theorical&quot; attenuation (reproduced in the laboratory) as stated by the manufacturer.METHODS: We used the E-A-Rfit computerized method, which measures the loss of attenuation of earplugs in the ear, calculating the difference of sound pressure between an &quot;outside&quot; microphone and an &quot;inside&quot; one, in relation to the same earplug. The measurements at the workplace were carried out on eight subjects with good hearing levels (aged between 20 and 25 years), who were trained to wear the devices correctly. After the tests carried out with the E-A-Rfit system, which does not require a subjective answer, we obtained graphs and tables showing real noise attenuation.CONCLUSIONS: We propose a comparison between hearing threshold for frequency, personal attenuation rating (PAR) and single number rating (SNR, provided by manufacturer): a difference of 10 dB (PAR 27 db vs. SNR 37 dB) was clearly evident although dissimilar methods were used to obtain such values. The instrument is rapid, simple and objective to use and also allows personalized information and training for every worker."

It was updated several times, the last time in 2012. It provides a summary of the current medical knowledge. A new measurement for the entire working life - the Effective Noise Dose by Liedtke - was introduced. Otoacoustic emissions (OAE) are now the crucial tests in order to detect a hair cell dysfunction. As from now the tinnitus has to be put under a more comprehensive examination. On the strength of post experience the previous speech audiometry (Freiburger Test) is reliable, it was retrained. In future the indication for hearing aids will be oriented towards the aid guidelines of the legal health insurance. The questionnaire for the expert opinion was revised and the fee was adapted."
"23860545","Occupational exposure to mercury among workers in a fluorescent lamp factory, Quisna Industrial Zone, Egypt.","BACKGROUND: With the fast growth in the market of fluorescent lamps, particularly compact fluorescent light, the associated risk of mercury exposure, which is an essential component in all types of fluorescent lamps, has received increasing public attention worldwide. Even low doses of mercury are toxic.OBJECTIVE: To study the health consequences of occupational exposure to mercury in workers of a fluorescent lamp factory.METHODS: In a cross-sectional study 138 workers of a fluorescent lamp factory and 151 people who had no occupational exposure to mercury (the comparison group) were studied. Environmental study of mercury and noise levels was done. For all participants a neurobehavioral test battery was administered, spirometry was performed and air conduction audiometry was done. Urinary mercury level was also measured for all participants.RESULTS: Prominent symptoms among workers exposed to mercury included tremors, emotional lability, memory changes, neuromuscular changes, and performance deficits in tests of cognitive function. Among the exposed group, the mean urinary mercury level was significantly higher in those who had personality changes or had manifestations of mercury toxicity. With increasing duration of employment and urinary mercury level, the performance of participants in neurobehavioral test battery and spirometric parameters deteriorated.CONCLUSION: Neurobehavioral test battery must be used for studying subclinical central nervous system dysfunction in those with chronic exposure to mercury. The test is especially useful for evaluating the severity of mercury effects in epidemiological studies. This study also reinforces the need for effective preventive programs for fluorescent lamp industry workplaces especially in developing countries with the lowest unhygienic work conditions."

All these veterans were randomly selected from Guangzhou Military Command. Group II were men with no military experience randomly chosen from the health examination center of Guangzhou General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command. Pure-tone thresholds of these two groups were measured and compared. The pure-tone thresholds of Group I were poorer than those of Group II at the frequencies of 4, 6 and 8 kHz. Thus, impulse noise accelerates age-related hearing loss. "
"23819619","Speech-in-noise screening tests by internet, part 3: test sensitivity for uncontrolled parameters in domestic usage.","OBJECTIVE: The online speech-in-noise test 'Earcheck' is sensitive for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). This study investigates effects of uncontrollable parameters in domestic self-screening, such as presentation level and transducer type, on speech reception thresholds (SRTs) obtained with Earcheck.DESIGN: Subjects performed 26 Earchecks that differed regarding presentation level (65, 71, and 77 dBA), presentation mode (monotic or diotic), and masking noise (two different low-pass filtered noises) in the lab. To investigate effects of test environment, participants conducted eight additional Earchecks at home using different transducer types (headphones or loudspeakers).STUDY SAMPLE: Thirty noise-exposed workers, either normal-hearing (n = 10), or with different degrees of NIHL (n = 20), participated.RESULTS: There was a minor effect of presentation levels exceeding 65 dBA in severely impaired listeners. Diotic presentation mode yielded lower SRTs compared to monotic presentation mode. Normal-hearing test results at home were poorer than in the laboratory, whereas hearing-impaired subjects performed better in domestic testing. Using loudspeakers deteriorated SRTs significantly in comparison to headphones, but only in hearing-impaired subjects.CONCLUSIONS: A monotic presentation mode using headphones is recommended for domestic screening. Since domestic testing affects SRT results, a follow up study using a large study population should assess Earcheck's validity when performed at home."
"23811690","Noise-induced hearing loss in workers exposed to urban stressors.","The technological and industrial progress together with the intensification of vehicular traffic and the adoption of new social habits are the cause of an increasing noise pollution with possible negative effects on the auditory system. This study aims to assess the noise exposure levels and the effects on the hearing threshold in outdoor and indoor male workers of a big Italian city. The study was carried out on 357 outdoor male workers, exposed to urban noise and on a control group of 357 unexposed indoor workers. Noise levels were measured in 30 outdoor and indoor areas. The subjects underwent tonal liminal audiometry in order to determine the value of their hearing threshold. During their working activity, outdoor and indoor workers are exposed to different noise levels LEX&lt;80 dB(A). At mid-low frequencies (250-2000 Hz), the results show significant differences in the average values of hearing threshold between the two groups in both ears and for all age classes; there are no significant differences between the two groups at higher frequencies. The outdoor noise levels measured are not usually ototoxic and the hearing loss at mid-low frequencies is not characteristic of the exposure to industrial noise. For these reasons the Authors hypothesize that the results may be due to the combined effect of the exposure to noise and to ototoxic air pollutants. The impairment of speech frequencies is disabling and involves the risk of missed forensic recognition."
"23808681","Quality of life, effort and disturbance perceived in noise: a comparison between employees with aided hearing impairment and normal hearing.","OBJECTIVES: The aims were to compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and hearing handicap between two groups of employees with normal hearing and aided hearing impairment (HI). HRQOL was also compared to a normative population. The second aim was to compare perceived effort (PE) and disturbance after completing a task in office noise between the two study groups.DESIGN: A Swedish version of the short form-36 (SF-36) and the hearing handicap inventory for adults (HHIA) was used to determine HRQOL and hearing handicap. The Borg-CR 10 scale was used to measure PE and disturbance.STUDY SAMPLE: Hearing impaired (n = 20) and normally hearing (n = 20) participants. The normative sample comprised of 597 matched respondents.RESULTS: Hearing-impaired employees report relatively good HRQOL in relation to the normative population, but significantly lower physical functioning and higher PE than their normally-hearing peers in noise. Results from the HHIA showed mild self-perceived hearing handicap.CONCLUSIONS: The current results demonstrate that physical health status can be negatively affected even at a mild-moderate severity of HI, and that a higher PE is reported from this group when performing a task in noise, despite the regular use of hearing aids."
"23792074","Prophylactic and therapeutic functions of drug combinations against noise-induced hearing loss.","Noise is the most common occupational and environmental hazard. Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is the second most common form of sensorineural hearing deficit, after age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Although promising approaches have been identified for reducing NIHL, currently there are no effective medications to prevent NIHL. Development of an efficacious treatment has been hampered by the complex array of cellular and molecular pathways involved in NIHL. We turned this difficulty into an advantage by asking whether NIHL could be effectively prevented by targeting multiple signaling pathways with a combination of drugs already approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We previously found that antiepileptic drugs blocking T-type calcium channels had both prophylactic and therapeutic effects for NIHL. NIHL can also be reduced by an up-regulation of glucocorticoid (GC) signaling pathways. Based on these findings, we tested a combination therapy for NIHL that included ethosuximide and zonisamide (anticonvulsants) and dexamethasone and methylprednisolone (synthetic GCs) in mice under exposure conditions typically associated with dramatic permanent threshold shifts (PTS). We first examined possible prophylactic effects for each drug when administered alone 2 h before noise, and calculated the median effective dose (ED50). We then tested for synergistic effects of two-drug combinations (anticonvulsant + GC), and identified combinations with the strongest synergy against NIHL, based on a previously established combination index (CI) metric. We repeated similar tests to determine their therapeutic effects when administered the same drugs 24 h after the noise exposure. Our study shows the feasibility of developing pharmacological intervention in multiple pathways, and discovering drug combinations with optimal synergistic effects in preventing permanent NIHL. "

However, reliable and valid thresholds can only be obtained in a sound-proof room, using a high-quality, well-calibrated audiometer, and by a well-trained administrator. Thresholds also need to be determined for several audiometric frequencies. This makes the test time-consuming and expensive, which is not ideal for the screening of large populations. A Speech-In-Noise test (SPIN), by contrast, does not have the abovementioned requirements. Because it can be implemented as a quick automated self-test, possibly over the Internet, a SPIN test is highly advantageous for screening purposes. However, its sensitivity for (isolated) high-frequency hearing loss, as typically seen in noise-exposed listeners, was unclear up to present. In this study, the authors investigated the sensitivity and specificity of the Digit Triplet SPIN test for detecting and monitoring (early-stage) high-frequency hearing loss, and its similarity across two different language versions.DESIGN: One-hundred eighteen noise-exposed workers, representing a wide range from no to severe high-frequency hearing loss, completed the French or Dutch version of the broadband Digit Triplet self-test in an office-like room. Pure-tone thresholds, collected by a professional audiologist in favorable settings, served as the reference.RESULTS: The 84 Dutch-speaking participants showed a very strong linear relation between the reference and the Digit Triplet test, with the pure-tone average at 2, 3, 4, and 6 kHz as a strong predictor (R = 0.86) for the speech-reception threshold. The sensitivity and specificity to detect mild high-frequency hearing loss were 92% (61 of 66) and 89% (16 of 18), respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was very high (=0.91) for several degrees of high-frequency hearing loss. With a within-subject standard deviation of only 0.8 dB, the Digit Triplet test also had a low measurement error. The results of the 34 French-speaking subjects showed a highly similar trend.CONCLUSIONS: The Digit Triplet test proves to have a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting different degrees of high-frequency hearing loss. Given its ease of use, this test is very suitable for screening purposes in occupational medicine, and potentially for the screening of adolescents at risk of recreational noise-induced hearing loss."
"23772828","The applicability of a speech-in-noise screening test in occupational hearing conservation.","OBJECTIVE: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is the most reported occupational health disease in the Netherlands. The internet-based speech-in-noise test Earcheck (Albrecht et al, 2005; Leensen et al, 2011b) is designed to detect beginning NIHL and can be a valuable tool in occupational hearing health surveillance. The aim of this study is to investigate the validity of Earcheck compared to regular screening audiometry.DESIGN: Subjects performed online Earcheck tests at home. The results are compared to a pure-tone screening audiogram obtained during regular occupational health examination. A subgroup performed the measurements twice to assess test-retest reliability.STUDY SAMPLE: Two hundred and forty-nine male construction employees who recently had a periodic occupational health examination participated.RESULTS: An average learning effect of -1.6 dB was found, that reduced with increasing test number. The test-retest variability was 1.6 dB. Sensitivity to detect beginning NIHL was 68%, with a specificity of 71%.CONCLUSIONS: Although sensitivity and specificity values are only moderate, the broad internet application still promises a valuable addition to current practice. The relatively high learning effect indicates that more reliable results can be obtained after a longer test session. When this is put into practice some improvement in sensitivity and specificity may be expected as well."
"23771423","Auditory risk assessment of college music students in jazz band-based instructional activity.","It is well-known that musicians are at risk for music-induced hearing loss, however, systematic evaluation of music exposure and its effects on the auditory system are still difficult to assess. The purpose of the study was to determine if college students in jazz band-based instructional activity are exposed to loud classroom noise and consequently exhibit acute but significant changes in basic auditory measures compared to non-music students in regular classroom sessions. For this we (1) measured and compared personal exposure levels of college students (n = 14) participating in a routine 50 min jazz ensemble-based instructional activity (experimental) to personal exposure levels of non-music students (n = 11) participating in a 50-min regular classroom activity (control), and (2) measured and compared pre- to post-auditory changes associated with these two types of classroom exposures. Results showed that the L eq (equivalent continuous noise level) generated during the 50 min jazz ensemble-based instructional activity ranged from 95 dBA to 105.8 dBA with a mean of 99.5 ± 2.5 dBA. In the regular classroom, the L eq ranged from 46.4 dBA to 67.4 dBA with a mean of 49.9 ± 10.6 dBA. Additionally, significant differences were observed in pre to post-auditory measures between the two groups. The experimental group showed a significant temporary threshold shift bilaterally at 4000 Hz (P &lt; 0.05), and a significant decrease in the amplitude of transient-evoked otoacoustic emission response in both ears (P &lt; 0.05) after exposure to the jazz ensemble-based instructional activity. No significant changes were found in the control group between pre- and post-exposure measures. This study quantified the noise exposure in jazz band-based practice sessions and its effects on basic auditory measures. Temporary, yet significant, auditory changes seen in music students place them at risk for hearing loss compared to their non-music cohorts."

This study involved 79 farmers and 64 controls. The workers completed a questionnaire to identify exclusion factors for audiological and cardiovascular risk factors. The participants underwent medical examination, measurement of blood pressure, electrocardiogram, blood tests, audiometry, and measurement of noise exposure. The farmers were found to have a higher prevalence of systolic and diastolic arterial hypertension as well as electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities compared with the controls. A significant prevalence of arterial hypertension was detected in the farmers exposed to noise, when compared with those who were not exposed. These results suggest that farmers are at risk of cardiovascular effects and that noise is a cardiovascular risk factor for farmers."
"23691834","Occupational noise-induced hearing loss in Indian steel industry workers: an exploratory study.","OBJECTIVE: The present study focused on exploring the current level of hearing protection and subsequently determined the prevalence of occupational noise-induced hearing loss among casting and forging industry workers.BACKGROUND: The casting and forging industry provides employment to a significant portion of the population.METHOD: The level of hearing protection was assessed through questionnaire survey of 572 workers. Out of these workers, 165 and another control group of 57 participants were assessed by formal audiometry. Audiometric tests were conducted at frequencies of 1.0 KHz to 8.0 KHz.The occurrence of hearing loss was determined on the basis of a hearing threshold level with a low fence of 25 dB. Student's test and ANOVA were used to compare the various groups; a p value &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTS: More than 90% of the workers sampled showed significant hearing loss at medium and high frequencies. The analyses revealed a higher prevalence of significant hearing loss among the forging workers compared with the workers associated with the other activities.CONCLUSIONS: The workers of the Indian steel industry are highly exposed to occupational noise. The majority of workers are not protected from noise-induced hearing loss. There is a need to provide special ear protectors for workers engaged in forging. A complete hearing protection program, including training, audiometry, job rotation, and the use of hearing protection devices, needs to be introduced."
"23689297","Interleukin-1ß gene polymorphism and hearing loss related to the history of occupational noise exposure in Brazilian elderly.","Hearing loss is the most common sensory impairment in older people, and may have social and psychological consequences, such as social isolation, frustration and depression. Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is an interaction of both genetic and environmental factors. Some studies have led to the identification of possible NIHL susceptibility genes. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the polymorphism of the interleukin (IL)-1ß gene at position + 3954 was associated with complaints of hearing loss due to occupational exposure. The sample was composed of elderly people with hearing loss (age = 60 years) divided into two groups: 99 with occupational exposure to noise and 193 without exposure. Information on occupational exposure to noise was obtained through interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire. Hearing acuity was measured from 500 to 6000 Hz and the IL-1ß genotype was obtained by the polymerase chain reaction- restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. Differences in allelic and genotypic frequencies, and the association between genotypic frequencies and complaints of hearing loss due to occupational exposure, were analyzed by the Chi-square test at the 5% significance level. Fifty-one percent of the elderly were homozygous for the ancestral allele (C), 17.2% were homozygous for the polymorphic allele (T) and 31.8% were heterozygous. The frequency was found to be 67-33% C to allele T. There was no significant association between polymorphism in gene IL-1ß and hearing loss associated with occupational exposure (<U+03C7>2 = 0.538; P = 0.676). No association was found with the polymorphism of the IL-1ß +3954 C/T gene and hearing loss associated with the occupational noise exposure history."
"23650771","[The influence of organic solvents on hearing and balance: a literature review].","This manuscript presents an overview of current knowledge on the influence of organic solvents on the hearing and balance systems. The authors analyzed--the literature data concerning the results of all human and the most relevant animal studies, published untill 2012. Moreover, the guidelines for occupational medicine specialists were proposed on the basis of literature review and the authors' own scientific experience. The literature data and our studies revealed the increased risk of hearing loss in workers exposed to organic solvents only, and well documented potentiation of harmful effects of combinedexposure to organic solvents and noise. Hearing impairment is mainly observed in high frequencies, but lower frequencies can also be involved (0.5-4 kHz). The impairment induced by exposure to organic solvents is mild, up to several dBs. In the combined exposure to noise and solvents, the noise effect predominates. Organic solvents affect the central pathways of vestibular system although unilateral or bilateral vestibular hypofunction might also be a possible consequence of solvent exposure. Occupational exposure to organic solvents is a risk factor for hearing and balance impairments. Therefore, workers exposed to solvents should be covered by hearing loss prevention programs. Speech in noise test (HINT) and posturography seem to be the most suitable tests for hearing and balance prevention programme for organic solvent exposed workers."

In multivariate modeling, older age, male gender, occupation, occupational noise, and having talked with a doctor about a hearing problem were independently associated with having had a hearing test in the past 5 years. Hearing aid use was low among participants with a moderate to severe hearing impairment (22.5%) and among participants with a hearing handicap (8.6%), as determined by the Hearing Handicap Inventory.CONCLUSIONS: Data support the need for improvement in hearing health care. Hearing aids' effectiveness is limited if patients do not acquire them or do not use them once acquired. Future research should focus on developing effective strategies for moving patients from diagnosis to treatment."
"23529883","Determinants of bilateral audiometric notches in noise-induced hearing loss.","HYPOTHESIS: To explore the possible determinants of bilateral audiometric notches in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).STUDY DESIGN: Prospectively enrolled cohort with cross-sectional analysis.METHODS: Male workers (n = 412) with exposure to continuous loud noise (noise exposure level normalized to a nominal 8-hour working day &gt;75 dBA) during work were included in this cohort study. The relationship between the presence of bilateral audiometric notches and age, noise exposure duration, noise exposure level, and shift from the predicted thresholds over different frequencies were determined by regression model analysis, receiver operating characteristic analysis, and area under the curve analysis.RESULTS: The presence of bilateral audiometric notches was closely associated with the shifts from the predicted thresholds over 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 kHz. The shift pattern was somewhat different between those who used hearing protection devices and those who did not. The shifts from the predicted thresholds demonstrated a stronger association with bilateral audiometric notches than did age, gender, noise exposure level, or noise exposure duration.CONCLUSIONS: The bilateral audiometric notches in NIHL could not be determined only on the basis of age, gender, noise exposure level, or noise exposure duration. The importance of other factors associated with bilateral audiometric notches should be recognized. Elucidation of the factors of formation of bilateral audiometric notches would help us to develop a more comprehensive protection strategy to prevent further NIHL."

"23369841","Effects of chronic noise exposure on speech-in-noise perception in the presence of normal audiometry.","OBJECTIVE: To assess auditory processing in noise-exposed subjects with normal audiograms and compare the findings with those of non-noise-exposed normal controls.METHODS: Ten noise-exposed Royal Air Force aircrew pilots were compared with 10 Royal Air Force administrators who had no history of noise exposure. Participants were matched in terms of age and sex. The subjects were assessed in terms of: pure tone audiometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions, suppression of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions in contralateral noise and auditory processing task performance (i.e. masking, frequency discrimination, auditory attention and speech-in-noise).RESULTS: All subjects had normal pure tone audiometry and transient evoked otoacoustic emissions amplitudes in both ears. The noise-exposed aircrew had similar pure tone audiometry thresholds to controls, but right ear transient evoked otoacoustic emissions were larger and speech-in-noise thresholds were elevated in the noise-exposed subjects compared to controls.CONCLUSION: The finding of poorer speech-in-noise perception may reflect noise-related impairment of auditory processing in retrocochlear pathways. Audiometry may not detect early, significant noise-induced hearing impairment."
"23324255","Auditory dysfunction associated with solvent exposure.","BACKGROUND: A number of studies have demonstrated that solvents may induce auditory dysfunction. However, there is still little knowledge regarding the main signs and symptoms of solvent-induced hearing loss (SIHL). The aim of this research was to investigate the association between solvent exposure and adverse effects on peripheral and central auditory functioning with a comprehensive audiological test battery.METHODS: Seventy-two solvent-exposed workers and 72 non-exposed workers were selected to participate in the study. The test battery comprised pure-tone audiometry (PTA), transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE), Random Gap Detection (RGD) and Hearing-in-Noise test (HINT).RESULTS: Solvent-exposed subjects presented with poorer mean test results than non-exposed subjects. A bivariate and multivariate linear regression model analysis was performed. One model for each auditory outcome (PTA, TEOAE, RGD and HINT) was independently constructed. For all of the models solvent exposure was significantly associated with the auditory outcome. Age also appeared significantly associated with some auditory outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence of the possible adverse effect of solvents on the peripheral and central auditory functioning. A discussion of these effects and the utility of selected hearing tests to assess SIHL is addressed."

"25515180","Is it reasonable to use 1 and 8 kHz anchor points in the medico-legal diagnosis and estimation of noise-induced hearing loss?","BACKGROUND: In the United Kingdom, use of 1 and 8 kHz as anchor point frequencies has been recommended for the medico-legal diagnosis and estimation of noise-induced hearing loss. There appear to be four assumptions behind the use of 1 and 8 kHz anchor point approach: (i) The frequencies of 1 and 8 kHz are not damaged by noise; therefore, the measured hearing thresholds at the said frequencies solely reflect age-related hearing loss, even in the noise-exposed; (ii) The hearing thresholds at 1 and 8 kHz are a valid predictor of the likely age-related hearing loss thresholds at the other frequencies; (iii) Age and noise damage are always completely additive; (iv) Individual's susceptibility to age and noise damage is not proportionate. Doubts have been expressed in the medical circles about the legitimacy and validity of their use as anchor points.OBJECTIVE OF REVIEW: Is it reasonable to use 1 and 8 kHz anchor points in the medico-legal diagnosis and estimation of noise-induced hearing loss?TYPE OF REVIEW: Medico-legal.SEARCH STRATEGY: Literature search; Medline, Embase, Internet, and medico-legal records.EVALUATION METHOD: Equating and comparing the assumptions in the anchor point approach with the information in medical literature.RESULTS: Based upon the information in medical literature, technical reports, and professional statements, the assumptions behind the use of anchor point approach cannot be reliably substantiated.CONCLUSIONS: 'Carte Blanche' use of 1 and 8 kHz anchor points is probably unreasonable and may well be unsafe in the medico-legal diagnosis and estimation of noise-induced hearing loss."

"25470622","Concurrent effect of noise exposure and smoking on extended high-frequency pure-tone thresholds.","OBJECTIVE: Concurrent effect of noise and smoking on hearing loss is a recent concern. In this study, the concurrent effect of noise and smoking on hearing loss in conventional frequencies and frequencies higher than 8 kHz was assessed.DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study on workers exposed to noise who were divided into two groups: smokers and non-smokers. Hearing thresholds were assessed by conventional audiometry, and HFA. Data were analysed using non-parametric tests and Student's t-test.STUDY SAMPLE: There were 212 workers.RESULTS: Ninety-seven subjects were smokers and 115 individuals were non-smokers. All subjects were exposed to 92.1 ± 2.4 dBA (Leq8h). The highest threshold in conventional and high-frequency audiometry was observed at 6 kHz and 16 kHz, respectively. Hearing threshold at frequencies above 1 kHz was significantly higher in the smokers than non-smokers. There was no correlation between hearing thresholds and pack-years of smoking.CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent exposure to noise and smoking may be associated with more hearing loss than exposure to noise alone in the conventional and high frequencies. However, other differences between smokers and non-smokers may explain these differences as well."
"25470371","The prevalence of notched audiograms in a cross-sectional study of 12,055 railway workers.","OBJECTIVE: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is one of the most reported occupational diseases internationally. The occurrence of audiometric notches is emphasized in both American and European guidelines for the diagnosis of NIHL. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of notched audiograms among railway personnel with and without noise exposure to better assess the usefulness of such notches in the diagnosis of NIHL.DESIGN: The most recent audiogram from 1994 to 2011 of a total of 12,055 railway workers, age 20 to 65 years, was obtained from the medical records of the occupational health service of the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). The prevalences of three types of notched audiograms, Coles notch, notch index, and 4 kHz notch, were computed, in relation to age, sex, and occupational noise exposure.RESULTS: Coles notch in either ear was found in 63% of the male railway maintenance workers, exposed to noise levels of 75 to 90 dB(A), compared with 53% of the non-noise exposed (&lt;70 dB(A)) traffic controllers (p &lt; 0.001). The corresponding figures for the 4 kHz notch were 31% versus 21% (p &lt; 0.001). For the notch index, 61% of the exposed and 51% of the controls had a notched audiogram (p &lt; 0.001). For female workers, the prevalence of audiometric notches was lower, and the differences between noise exposed and nonexposed was smaller than those in men. Increasing age led to an increased prevalence of notches.CONCLUSIONS: Audiometric notches commonly occur among both noise-exposed and those not exposed to noise in railway personnel. The usefulness of audiometric notches in the diagnosis of NIHL is therefore limited."

Seventy-five employees engaged in sanitation fixtures production and a control group of sixty-four office workers, who were not exposed to agents that could damage the cardiovascular system, participated in our study. The selected workers completed a clinical-anamnestic questionnaire, and underwent a medical examination, blood pressure test, electrocardiogram (ECG), blood tests, and audiometry. Measurements of environmental noise, dust, and lead were also carried out. The exposed workers, in comparison to the control group, showed a higher frequency of hypertension, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.05), as well as electrocardiographic abnormalities (p&lt;0.05). There was also a higher frequency of hypertension and electrocardiographic abnormalities among subjects with audiometric deficit compared to normoacoustic subjects (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.05).RESULTS: from our study suggest that work activity in the sanitary fixtures industry can have an influence on the cardiovascular system, and noise can be the main cause of damage for the cardiovascular system in exposed workers, as cardiovascular damage seems to be linked to hearing loss."
"25432298","Prediction of hearing loss among the noise-exposed workers in a steel factory using artificial intelligence approach.","PURPOSE: Prediction of hearing loss in noisy workplaces is considered to be an important aspect of hearing conservation program. Artificial intelligence, as a new approach, can be used to predict the complex phenomenon such as hearing loss. Using artificial neural networks, this study aims to present an empirical model for the prediction of the hearing loss threshold among noise-exposed workers.METHODS: Two hundred and ten workers employed in a steel factory were chosen, and their occupational exposure histories were collected. To determine the hearing loss threshold, the audiometric test was carried out using a calibrated audiometer. The personal noise exposure was also measured using a noise dosimeter in the workstations of workers. Finally, data obtained five variables, which can influence the hearing loss, were used for the development of the prediction model. Multilayer feed-forward neural networks with different structures were developed using MATLAB software. Neural network structures had one hidden layer with the number of neurons being approximately between 5 and 15 neurons.RESULTS: The best developed neural networks with one hidden layer and ten neurons could accurately predict the hearing loss threshold with RMSE = 2.6 dB and R(2) = 0.89. The results also confirmed that neural networks could provide more accurate predictions than multiple regressions.CONCLUSIONS: Since occupational hearing loss is frequently non-curable, results of accurate prediction can be used by occupational health experts to modify and improve noise exposure conditions."
"25421175","Effective identification of functional hearing loss using behavioral threshold measures.","PURPOSE: Four functional hearing loss protocols were evaluated.METHOD: For each protocol, 30 participants feigned a hearing loss first on an audiogram and then for a screening test that began a threshold search from extreme levels (-10 or 90 dB HL). Two-tone and 3-tone protocols compared thresholds for ascending and descending tones for 2 (0.5 and 1.0 kHz) and 3 (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 kHz) frequencies, respectively. A noise-band protocol compared an ascending noise-band threshold with that for 2 descending tones (0.5 and 1.0 kHz). A spondee protocol compared an ascending spondee threshold with that for 2 descending tones (0.5 and 1.0 kHz). These measures were repeated without the participants feigning losses.RESULTS: With nonfeigning participants, ascending and descending threshold differences were minimal for all protocols. When the participants feigned a loss, the spondee protocol produced the largest average threshold difference (30.8 dB), whereas the other protocols produced smaller differences (19.6-22.2 dB).CONCLUSIONS: Using both the screening test and a comparison of the initial audiogram with the screening test, the spondee and 3-tone protocols resulted in 100% true positives and 0% false positives for functional hearing loss. Either of these protocols could be used clinically or in occupational hearing conservation programs."
"25405841","The impact of different background noises: effects on cognitive performance and perceived disturbance in employees with aided hearing impairment and normal hearing.","BACKGROUND: Health care professionals frequently meet employees with hearing impairment (HI) who experience difficulties at work. There are indications that the majority of these difficulties might be related to the presence of background noise. Moreover, research has also shown that high-level noise has a more detrimental effect on cognitive performance and self-rated disturbance in individuals with HI than low-level noise.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of different types of background noise on cognitive performance and perceived disturbance (PD) in employees with aided HI and normal hearing.RESEARCH DESIGN: A mixed factorial design was conducted to examine the effect of noise in four experimental conditions.STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 40 participants (21 men and 19 women) were recruited to take part in the study. The study sample consisted of employees with HI (n = 20) and normal hearing (n = 20). The group with HI had a mild-moderate sensorineural HI, and they were all frequent hearing-aid users.INTERVENTION: The current study was conducted by using four general work-related tasks (mental arithmetic, orthographic decoding, phonological decoding, and serial recall) in four different background conditions: (1) quiet, (2) office noise at 56 dBA, (3) daycare noise at 73.5 dBA, and (4) traffic noise at 72.5 dBA. Reaction time and the proportion of correct answers in the working tasks were used as outcome measures of cognitive performance. The Borg CR-10 scale was used to assess PD.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data collection occurred on two separate sessions, completed within 4 wk of each other. All tasks and experimental conditions were used in a counterbalanced order. Two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures was performed to analyze the results. To examine interaction effects, pairwise t-tests were used. Pearson correlation coefficients between reaction time and proportion of correct answers, and cognitive performance and PD were also calculated to examine the possible correlation between the different variables.RESULTS: No significant between-group or within-group differences in cognitive performance were observed across the four background conditions. Ratings of PD showed that both groups rated PD according to noise level, where higher noise level generated a higher PD. The present findings also demonstrated that the group with HI was more disturbed by higher than lower levels of noise (i.e., traffic and daycare setting compared with office setting). This pattern was observed consistently throughout four working tasks where the group with HI reported a significantly greater PD in the daycare and traffic settings compared with office noise.CONCLUSIONS: The present results demonstrate that background noise does not impair cognitive performance in nonauditory tasks in employees with HI and normal hearing, but that PD is affected to a greater extent in employees with HI during higher levels of background noise exposure. In addition, this study also supports previous studies regarding the detrimental effects that high-level noise has on employees with HI. Therefore, we emphasize the need of both self-rated and cognitive measurements in hearing care and occupational health services for both employees with normal hearing and HI."
"25387537","A comparison of the effects of solvent and noise exposure on hearing, together and separately.","The objective of the present study was to assess the effects of occupational exposure to noise and organic solvents on hearing loss in bus and truck plant workers. Our case control study contained 469 workers from a bus and truck plant divided into three groups. The first group contained workers exposed to only noise; the second group contained workers exposed to both noise and mixture solvents at a permissible level; and the third group included workers exposed to permissible levels of solvents. The control group (Group 4) included 119 individuals selected randomly, persons who were not exposed to noise and solvents. These groups were compared in terms of each individual's frequency hearing loss in both ears. Our study demonstrates that combined exposure to mixed solvents and noise can exacerbate hearing loss in workers. Hence, a suitable hearing protection program is advised that would contain short-interval audiometric examinations and efficient hearing protectors. "
"25381186","Description and evaluation of a hearing conservation program in use in a professional symphony orchestra.","Professional orchestral musicians risk permanent hearing loss while playing their instruments. Protecting the hearing of these musicians in the workplace is critical to their ongoing ability to play their instruments, but typical workplace hearing conservation measures can have very damaging effects on the product (music) and the musicians' abilities to hear one another sufficiently. To enable effective intervention, orchestras as employers must encourage engagement with hearing protection programs and implement controls while preserving the integrity of the music. To achieve this, typical approaches used in other industries must be redesigned to suit this unique workplace. In response to these challenges, the Queensland Symphony Orchestra (Brisbane, Australia) introduced a comprehensive hearing conservation strategy in 2005 based upon best practice at the time. This strategy-which has been regularly refined-continues to be implemented on a daily basis. This investigation aimed to assess the successes, difficulties, and practical viability of the program. To achieve this a process evaluation was carried out, incorporating archival analyses, player and management focus groups, and an interview with the program's administrator. Results show the program has successfully become integrated into the orchestra's and the musicians' daily operations and significantly contributes to managing the risk of hearing loss in this population. While there is room for improvement in the orchestra's approach-particularly regarding usable personal protective devices and improved education and training, results are encouraging. This study provides a basis for those wishing to implement or evaluate similar paradigms."
"25372170","Audiometric profile of civilian pilots according to noise exposure.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the audiometric profile of civilian pilots according to the noise exposure level.METHODS: This observational cross-sectional study evaluated 3,130 male civilian pilots aged between 17 and 59 years. These pilots were subjected to audiometric examinations for obtaining or revalidating the functional capacity certificate in 2011. The degree of hearing loss was classified as normal, suspected noise-induced hearing loss, and no suspected hearing loss with other associated complications. Pure-tone air-conduction audiometry was performed using supra-aural headphones and acoustic stimulus of the pure-tone type, containing tone thresholds of frequencies between 250 Hz and 6,000 Hz. The independent variables were professional categories, length of service, hours of flight, and right or left ear. The dependent variable was pilots with suspected noise-induced hearing loss. The noise exposure level was considered low/medium or high, and the latter involved periods &gt; 5,000 flight hours and &gt; 10 years of flight service.RESULTS: A total of 29.3% pilots had suspected noise-induced hearing loss, which was bilateral in 12.8% and predominant in the left ear (23.7%). The number of pilots with suspected hearing loss increased as the noise exposure level increased.CONCLUSIONS: Hearing loss in civilian pilots may be associated with noise exposure during the period of service and hours of flight."
"25352160","Hearing among male firefighters: a comparison with hearing data from screened and unscreened male population.","We investigated whether hearing loss is associated with firefighting. We conducted cross-sectional study comparing hearing threshold levels (HTLs) of 912 male firefighters with two hearing databases obtained from an otologically normal male Korean population (KONP) and a non-industrial noise-exposed male Korean population (KNINEP), considering age and the main roles of firefighters. Firefighters' age-adjusted HTLs were significantly worse than those of KONP (prevalence ratio (PR)=5.29, P&lt;0.001)but not different from those of KNINEP (PR=0.99, P=0.550). Rescuers (PR=1.005, P&lt;0.001) had worse hearing than the KNINEP after age adjustment. Comparison of firefighters' HTLs (50th and 90th percentiles) with those of KONP and KNINEP by age and frequency showed that firefighters' HTLs had significant increases (poorer hearing) across most age groups and frequencies compared with KONP. Compared with KNINEP, firefighters' HTLs were worse in the younger age groups (&lt;45 years) but not different in the older age groups (&gt;45 years). In conclusion, the hearing thresholds of younger firefighters and rescuers were worse than expected by normal aging alone. Future research should include longitudinal studies to consider variable risk factors, such as military service, smoking, and so on. "
"25350439","Doctors' reports of work-related hearing loss.","BACKGROUND: Noise-induced hearing loss is the diagnosis that is most frequently reported to the Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority. The objective of this study was to describe the doctors' reports on noise-induced hearing loss and assess the quality of the information.MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study is based on reports to the Labour Inspection Authority for the years 2005-09. We grouped the reporting incidence according to industry, gender and age on the basis of Statistics Norway's employment statistics. The reports were compared to data from Statistics Norway's living conditions survey from 2009.RESULTS: A total of 7,888 reports had been submitted in the study period (2005-2009), 96% of which concerned men. The annual reporting incidence amounted to 66 per 100,000 employees; six and 120 for women and men respectively. The reporting incidence was highest in the age group 55-74 years and for the construction and manufacturing industries. Altogether 52% of the reports pertained to employees who were no longer working in the enterprise where they had been exposed to noise. The proportion of reports pertaining to employees aged under 40 years was lower than the corresponding proportion of those who reported work-related hearing loss in Statistics Norway's living conditions survey from 2009. Occupational health physicians submitted 85% of the reports.INTERPRETATION: Of those exposed to noise, only a small proportion of women, younger employees and employees in enterprises with no access to occupational health services are captured by the reporting system. The same may apply to employees in industries such as transport and retail trade, but this will require further investigation."
"25335826","Prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss among woodworkers in Nepal: a pilot study.","BACKGROUND: The woodworking industry represents an important cause of occupational noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), a significant yet underappreciated problem in many developing countries.OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence of occupational NIHL among woodworkers in Nepal and measure noise levels at workplaces.METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study with 124 woodworkers (88 carpenters, 36 sawyers), recruited through convenience sampling from 26 workplaces. Pure-tone audiometry between the frequencies 0·5 and 8 kHz ascertained participants' hearing status, and noise readings were taken at selected workplaces.RESULTS: In all, 31% of carpenters and 44% of sawyers met criteria for NIHL, with 7 and 17% meeting World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for hearing impairment (HI), respectively. Noise levels at various workplaces ranged from 71·2 to 93·9 dBA.CONCLUSIONS: Woodworkers in Nepal are at risk of occupational NIHL. As the industry develops, this problem will likely become more extensive, highlighting the need for workplace interventions and additional research."
"25324318","A cross-sectional study of hearing thresholds among 4627 Norwegian train and track maintenance workers.","OBJECTIVE: Railway workers performing maintenance work of trains and tracks could be at risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss, since they are exposed to noise levels of 75-90 dB(A) with peak exposures of 130-140 dB(C). The objective was to make a risk assessment by comparing the hearing thresholds among train and track maintenance workers with a reference group not exposed to noise and reference values from the ISO 1999.DESIGN: Cross-sectional.SETTING: A major Norwegian railway company.PARTICIPANTS: 1897 and 2730 male train and track maintenance workers, respectively, all exposed to noise, and 2872 male railway traffic controllers and office workers not exposed to noise.OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the hearing threshold (pure tone audiometry, frequencies from 0.5 to 8 kHz), and the secondary outcome was the prevalence of audiometric notches (Coles notch) of the most recent audiogram.RESULTS: Train and track maintenance workers aged 45 years or older had a small mean hearing loss in the 3-6 kHz area of 3-5 dB. The hearing loss was less among workers younger than 45 years. Audiometric notches were slightly more prevalent among the noise exposed (59-64%) group compared with controls (49%) for all age groups. They may therefore be a sensitive measure in disclosing an early hearing loss at a group level.CONCLUSIONS: Train and track maintenance workers aged 45 years or older, on average, have a slightly greater hearing loss and more audiometric notches compared with reference groups not exposed to noise. Younger (&lt;45 years) workers have hearing thresholds comparable to the controls."
"25320701","Effect of exposure to a mixture of organic solvents on hearing thresholds in petrochemical industry workers.","INTRODUCTION: Hearing loss is one of the most common occupational diseases. In most workplaces, workers are exposed to noise and solvents simultaneously, so the potential risk of hearing loss due to solvents may be attributed to noise. In this study we aimed to assess the effect of exposure to mixed aromatic solvents on hearing in the absence of exposure to hazardous noise.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 99 workers from the petrochemical industry with exposure to a mixture of organic solvents whose noise exposure was lower than 85 dBA were compared with 100 un-exposed controls. After measuring sound pressure level and mean concentration of each solvent in the workplace, pure-tone-audiometry was performed and the two groups were compared in terms of high-frequency and low-frequency hearing loss. T-tests and Chi-square tests were used to compare the two groups.RESULTS: The mean hearing threshold at all frequencies among petrochemical workers was normal (below 25 dB). We did not observe any significant association between solvent exposure and high-frequency or low-frequency hearing loss.CONCLUSION: This study showed that temporary exposure (less than 4 years) to a mixture of organic solvents, without exposure to noise, does not affect workers' hearing threshold in audiometry tests."

The involvement of inflammation in this condition has been suggested.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between interleukin - 6 (IL-6) polymorphism and susceptibility to NIHL.METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with a sample of 191 independent elderly individuals aged &gt;60 years of age. Information on exposure to occupational noise was obtained by interviews. Audiological evaluation was performed using pure tone audiometry and genotyped through PCR by restriction fragment length polymorphism - PCR-RFLP. Data were analyzed using the chi-square test and the odds ratio (OR), with the significance level set at 5%.RESULTS: Among elderly with hearing loss (78.0%), 18.8% had a history of exposure to occupational noise. There was a statistically significant association between the genotype frequencies of the IL-6 -174 and NIHL. The elderly with the CC genotype were less likely to have hearing loss due to occupational noise exposure when compared to those carrying the GG genotype (OR=0.0124; 95% CI 0.0023-0.0671; p&lt;0.001).CONCLUSION: This study suggests there is an association of polymorphisms in the IL-6 gene at position - G174C with susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss."
"25292321","[Diagnostics on noise-induced hearing loss].","Occupational noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) may qualify to compensation and must be distinguished from the ski slope hearing loss (SKI) which is a hereditary type of hearing loss. By combining the NIHL and presbyacusis tables of ISO 1999 it was concluded that in a hearing loss caused solely by noise and ageing the median threshold at 2 kHz is never poorer than 35 dB, and that the ratio between the actual 3 kHz threshold and the average 2-4 kHz threshold does not exceed 1.3. Thus, the audiometric characteristics of the 2-3 kHz segment can distinguish between NIHL and SKI. "

A randomized clinical trial.","BACKGROUND: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is one of the most common occupational diseases and the second most common cause of workers' claims for occupational injuries.OBJECTIVE: Due to high prevalence of NIHL and several reports of improper use of hearing protective devices (HPDs), we conducted this study to compare the effect of face-to-face training in effective use of earplugs with appropriate NRR to overprotection of workers by using earplugs with higher than necessary noise reduction rating (NRR).METHODS: In a randomized clinical trial, 150 workers referred to occupational medicine clinic were randomly allocated to three arms---a group wearing earplugs with an NRR of 25 with no training in appropriate use of the device; a group wearing earplugs with an NRR of 25 with training; another group wearing earplugs with an NRR of 30, with no training. Hearing threshold was measured in the study groups by real ear attenuation at threshold (REAT) method. This trial is registered with Australian New Zealand clinical trials Registry, number ACTRN00363175.RESULTS: The mean ± SD age of the participants was 28 ± 5 (range: 19-39) years. 42% of participants were female. The mean noise attenuation in the group with training was 13.88 dB, significantly higher than those observed in other groups. The highest attenuation was observed in high frequencies (4, 6, and 8 kHz) in the group with training.CONCLUSION: Training in appropriate use of earplugs significantly affects the efficacy of earplugs---even more than using an earplug with higher NRR."

A case of hearing loss after 3 T MRI has been reported in this institution and hence this study. The objective of this study was to determine whether temporary threshold shift (TTS) in high frequency hearing occurs in patients undergoing 3 T MRI scans of the head and neck. A total of 35 patients undergoing head and neck 3 T MRI for various clinical indications were tested with pure tone audiometry in different frequencies including high frequencies, before and after the MRI scan. Any threshold change from the recorded baseline of 10 dB was considered significant. All patients were fitted with foamed 3 M earplugs before the procedure following the safety guidelines for 3 T MRI. The mean time for MRI procedure was 1,672 s (range 1,040-2,810). The noise dose received by each patient amounted to an average of 3,906.29% (1,415-9,170%). The noise dose was derived from a normograph used by Occupational Noise Surveys. This was calculated using the nomograph of L eq, L EX, noise dose and time. There was no statistically significant difference between the hearing threshold before and after the MRI procedures for all the frequencies (paired t test, P &gt; 0.05). For patients using 3 M foamed earplugs, noise level generated by 3 T MRI during routine clinical sequence did not cause any TTS in high frequency hearing."

"25188429","Noise-induced hearing loss: an occupational medicine perspective.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Up to 30 million workers in the United States are exposed to potentially detrimental levels of noise. Although reliable medications for minimizing or reversing noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) are not currently available, NIHL is entirely preventable. The purpose of this article is to review the epidemiology and pathophysiology of occupational NIHL. We will focus on at-risk populations and discuss prevention programs. Current prevention programs focus on reducing inner ear damage by minimizing environmental noise production and through the use of personal hearing protective devices.RECENT FINDINGS: NIHL is the result of a complex interaction between environmental factors and patient factors, both genetic and acquired. The effects of noise exposure are specific to an individual. Trials are currently underway evaluating the role of antioxidants in protection from, and even reversal of, NIHL.SUMMARY: Occupational NIHL is the most prevalent occupational disease in the United States. Occupational noise exposures may contribute to temporary or permanent threshold shifts, although even temporary threshold shifts may predispose an individual to eventual permanent hearing loss. Noise prevention programs are paramount in reducing hearing loss as a result of occupational exposures."
"25123579","Risks of a lifetime in construction. Part II: Chronic occupational diseases.","BACKGROUND: We developed working-life estimates of risk for dust-related occupational lung disease, COPD, and hearing loss based on the experience of the Building Trades National Medical Screening Program in order to (1) demonstrate the value of estimates of lifetime risk, and (2) make lifetime risk estimates for common conditions among construction workers.METHODS: Estimates of lifetime risk were performed based on 12,742 radiographic evaluations, 12,679 spirometry tests, and 11,793 audiograms.RESULTS: Over a 45-year working life, 16% of construction workers developed COPD, 11% developed parenchymal radiological abnormality, and 73.8% developed hearing loss. The risk for occupationally related disease over a lifetime in a construction trade was 2-6 times greater than the risk in non-construction workers.CONCLUSIONS: When compared with estimates from annualized cross-sectional data, lifetime risk estimates are highly useful for risk expression, and should help to inform stakeholders in the construction industry as well as policy-makers about magnitudes of risk."
"25033789","Comparison of the effects of N-acetyl-cysteine and ginseng in prevention of noise induced hearing loss in male textile workers.","Previous studies revealed the role of antioxidant agents in prevention of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL). The aim of this study was to compare the protective effect of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and ginseng on protection of NIHL in textile workers exposed to continuous noise in daily working. In this study, 48 participants were randomly allocated to three groups; Group I received NAC 1200 mg/day, Group II received ginseng 200 mg/day, and Group III (control group) received no supplement. Pure tone audiometry and high frequency audiometry were performed preshift before and after 14 days (on day 15). Linear regression analysis results showed reduced noise-induced temporary threshold shift (TTS) for NAC and ginseng groups at 4, 6 and 16 kHz (P &lt; 0.001) in both ears. Furthermore, the protective effects were more prominent in NAC than ginseng. Our results show that NAC and ginseng can reduce noise induced TTS in workers exposed to occupational noise. Further studies are needed to prove antioxidants benefits in hearing conservation programs. "

This comparative cross sectional study aims to determine the prevalence of hearing loss in both a group of high risk workers and a control group and to assess their knowledge of the effects of noise on hearing health. A total of 101 market mill workers and 103 controls employed within markets in the city of Accra, Ghana, were evaluated using a structured questionnaire and pure tone audiometry. The questionnaire assessed factors including self-reported hearing loss, tinnitus, knowledge on the effects of noise on hearing health and the use of hearing protective devices. Pure tone audiometric testing was conducted for both mill workers and controls. Noise levels at the work premises of the mill workers and controls were measured. Symptoms of hearing loss were reported by 24 (23.76%) and 8 (7.7%) mill workers and controls respectively. Fifty-five (54.5%) and fifty-four (52.37%) mill workers and controls exhibited knowledge of the effects of noise on hearing health. Five (5.0%) mill workers used hearing protective devices. There was significant sensorineural hearing loss and the presence of a 4 kHz audiometric notch among mill workers when compared with controls for the mean thresholds of 2 kHz, 3 kHz and 4 kHz (P = 0. 001). The prevalence of hearing loss in the better hearing ears of the mill workers and controls was 24.8% and 4.8% respectively (P &lt; 0.5). The prevalence of hearing loss, which may be characteristic of NIHL in the better hearing ears of the mill workers and controls was 24.8% and 4.8% respectively. The majority of mill workers did not use hearing protection. "
"24953090","Assessment of exposure to voices and noise via earphones in manufacturing industry workers in Japan.","OBJECTIVES: There is concern that sound via earphones and headphones attached to headsets used in workplaces may be a risk factor for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Although there are some previous studies investigating exposure to noise from headphones, almost none have assessed the risks to workers who use earphones. We assessed exposure to noise among workers who regularly wear earphones in noisy workplaces.METHODS: The subjects of this study were 21 workers who regularly wear earphones in three manufacturing companies in Japan. The sound pressure output from earphones and personal exposure to occupational noise was measured for each worker. A noise-dosimeter was used to measure individual exposure to occupational noise. The sound pressure output from the earphones was measured by recording the electric signal with a data recorder attached to the earphones, and the recording was analyzed by playing it back in the laboratory through a sound analyzer via an ear simulator.RESULTS: The mean scores for personal exposure and earphone output LAeq were 87.9 dB and 87.6 dB, respectively. Earphone output LAeq exceeded 85 dB for two-thirds of the subjects. Nearly all the subjects lacked hearing protection devices (HPDs) on their earphones.CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that workers who use earphones in noisy workplaces are exposed to the following NIHL risk factors: (1) they are deprived of the opportunity to fit appropriate HPDs, and (2) the sound pressure output from the earphones themselves exceeds the occupational exposure limit."
"24940310","Prevalence of noise induced hearing loss among employees at a mining industry in Zimbabwe.","BACKGROUND: Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) is within the top five occupational illnesses in Zimbabwe. Workers at a mining company complained about loss of hearing at the mine clinic.OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of NIHL among employees at the Mine.METHODS: We conducted a descriptive cross sectional study at the mine. Workers were proportionally selected to represent all the mine departments or working areas. We measured noise levels at various mine sites, conducted a walk-through survey to observe noise related worker practices and conducted audiometric testing.RESULTS: Mean age for workers was 34.8±7.6 years and the mean duration of exposure to noise was 7.5±1.2 years. All workers could define noise. Ninety (53%) workers attributed NIHL to noisy work environment. Excessive noise levels were in Plant Processing (94 dBA), Underground Mining (102 dBA) and (Underground Workshop (103 dBA). Sixty two (36.7%) workers had NIHL. NIHL increased as a function of age (chi square=30.99 df=3 p&lt;0.01) and was associated with work area (chi square=24.96 df=5 p&lt;0.01). Observed workers took heed of noise warnings. There was no documented hearing conservation program at the mine.CONCLUSION: The prevalence of NIHL of 37% is high. Age and work area were associated with NIHL. Studies reported that age tends to distort the relationship between noise exposure and NIHL. Mine management should institute a hearing conservation program to protect employees against hazardous noise. Management may meanwhile use administrative controls and adhere to permissible exposure limits according to the noise regulations."
"24923465","High-frequency hearing thresholds: effects of age, occupational ultrasound and noise exposure.","PURPOSE: It has been suggested that high-frequency audiometry (HFA) could represent a useful preventive measure in exposed workers. The aim was to investigate the effects of age, ultrasound and noise on high-frequency hearing thresholds.METHODS: We tested 24 industrial ultrasound-exposed subjects, 113 industrial noise-exposed subjects and 148 non-exposed subjects. Each subject was tested with both conventional-frequency (0.125-8 kHz) and high-frequency (9-18 kHz) audiometry.RESULTS: The hearing threshold at high frequency deteriorated as a function of age, especially in subjects more than 30 years old. The ultrasound-exposed subjects had significantly higher hearing thresholds than the non-exposed ones at the high frequencies, being greatest from 10 to 14 kHz. This hearing loss was already significantly evident in subjects with exposure &lt;5 years and increased with years of exposure and advancing age. The noise exposure group had significantly higher hearing thresholds than the non-exposed group at the conventional frequencies 4 and 6 kHz and at the high frequency of 14 kHz. After stratification for age, there was a significant difference between the two groups at 9-10 and 14-15 kHz only for those under 30 years of age.CONCLUSION: Multivariate analysis indicated that age was the primary predictor, and noise and ultrasound exposure the secondary predictors of hearing thresholds in the high-frequency range. The results suggest that HFA could be useful in the early diagnosis of noise-induced hearing loss in younger groups of workers (under 30 years of age)."
"24879031","Does occupational noise cause asymmetric hearing loss?","OBJECTIVE: Determine whether occupational noise exposure increases audiometric asymmetry.DESIGN: Audiograms were performed on 2044 men from the Occupational Noise and Hearing Survey, representing four groups based on preliminary screening (for previous noise exposure, otologic history, and otoscopy) and current occupational noise exposure. The effects of current noise exposure on audiometric asymmetry were tested using ANCOVA, with binaural average thresholds as covariates.RESULTS: There were no significant differences in asymmetry attributable to current occupational noise exposure.RESULTS: Occupational noise exposure does not usually cause or exacerbate audiometric asymmetry."

The current reference test is pure-tone air-conduction audiometry (PTA), but this test cannot be used to detect early hearing loss.</AbstractText>: Noise is one of the most pervasive hazards in the workplace. Despite regulations and preventive measures, noise-induced hearing loss is common. The current reference test is pure-tone air-conduction audiometry (PTA), but this test cannot be used to detect early hearing loss.OBJECTIVE: In this study, we assess one-day auditory fatigue using both PTA and efferent reflexes (ER) measured using DPOAEs associated with contralateral acoustic stimulation (CAS DPOAEs).DESIGN: The noise exposure history, PTA, and ER detection were performed in seven different companies where the L(EX,8h) was 85 dB(A). Hearing was tested before and at the end of the working day.STUDY SAMPLE: Forty-six volunteers were selected to carry out this study.RESULTS: After a single working day, a greater impact of noise was measured using ER thresholds than PTA or DPOAEs. ER measurements are objective, easy to perform, and do not require a sound-attenuated booth.CONCLUSION: Screening workers by periodically measuring ER thresholds using CAS DPOAEs helps detect early changes in hearing status, before the onset of noise-induced hearing loss. These tests can be readily applied as part of a hearing conservation program."
"24804714","Asymmetry in noise-induced hearing loss: evaluation of two competing theories.","Competing theories exist about why asymmetry is observed in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). We evaluated these theories using a cohort of young workers studied over 16 years. The study aim was to describe and evaluate patterns of hearing loss and asymmetry by gender, agricultural exposure and gunfire exposure. This was a secondary analysis of data collected from young adults during follow-up of a randomized controlled trial. This follow-up study evaluated long-term effects of a hearing conservation intervention for rural students. The sample consisted of 392 of 690 participants from the original trial. In total, 355 young adults (aged 29-33 years) completed baseline and follow-up noise exposure surveys and clinical audiometric examinations. Data are displayed graphically as thresholds by frequency and ear and degree of asymmetry between ears (left minus right). In the primary group comparisons, low and high frequency averages and mean high frequency asymmetry were analyzed using mixed linear models. At frequencies &gt;2000 Hz, men showed more hearing loss, with greater asymmetry and a different asymmetry pattern, than women. For men with documented hearing loss, there was a trend toward increasing asymmetry with increasing levels of hearing loss. Asymmetry at high frequencies varied substantially by level of shooting exposure. While &quot;head shadowing&quot; is accepted as the primary explanation for asymmetric hearing loss in the audiologic and related public health literature, our findings are more consistent with physiological differences as the primary cause of asymmetric hearing loss, with greater susceptibility to NIHL in the left ear of men.

"24708640","Using prophylactic antioxidants to prevent noise-induced hearing damage in young adults: a protocol for a double-blind, randomized controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: During leisure activities young people are often exposed to excessive noise levels resulting in an increase of noise-induced symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus and hyperacusis. Noise-induced tinnitus is often perceived after loud music exposure and provides an important marker for overexposure as a temporary threshold shift that is often not experienced by the individual itself. As oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of noise-induced hearing loss, the use of antioxidants to prevent hearing damage has recently become the subject of research.METHODS: This study proposes a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial to assess the effects of a prophylactic combination of N-acetylcysteine (600 mg) and magnesium (200 mg) prior to leisure noise exposure in young adults. The primary outcome measure is the tinnitus loudness scored by a visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary outcome measures are the differences in audiological measurements for the antioxidant treatments compared to placebo intake. Audiological testing comprising of pure tone audiometry including frequencies up to 16 kHz, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions and speech-in-noise testing will be performed prior to and within 7 hours after noise exposure. By use of a mixed effects statistical model, the effects of antioxidants compared to placebo intake will be assessed.DISCUSSION: As adolescents and young adults often do not use hearing protection while being exposed to loud music, the use of preventive antioxidant intake may provide a useful and harmless way to prevent noise-induced hearing damage in this population. Furthermore, when exposed to hazardous noise levels the protection provided by hearing protectors might not be sufficient to prevent hearing damage and antioxidants may provide additive otoprotective effects. Previous research mainly focused on occupational noise exposure. The present study provides a protocol to assess the usefulness of antioxidants during leisure noise activities.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The present protocol is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01727492."
"24700499","Do hearing protectors protect hearing?","BACKGROUND: We examined the association between self-reported hearing protection use at work and incidence of hearing shifts over a 5-year period.METHODS: Audiometric data from 19,911 workers were analyzed. Two hearing shift measures-OSHA standard threshold shift (OSTS) and high-frequency threshold shift (HFTS)-were used to identify incident shifts in hearing between workers' 2005 and 2009 audiograms. Adjusted odds ratios were generated using multivariable logistic regression with multi-level modeling.RESULTS: The odds ratio for hearing shift for workers who reported never versus always wearing hearing protection was nonsignificant for OSTS (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.92-1.64) and marginally significant for HFTS (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.00-1.59). A significant linear trend towards increased risk of HFTS with decreased use of hearing protection was observed (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02).CONCLUSION: The study raises concern about the effectiveness of hearing protection as a substitute for noise control to prevent noise-induced hearing loss in the workplace."
"24662953","Prevalence of workers with shifts in hearing by industry: a comparison of OSHA and NIOSH Hearing Shift Criteria.","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the prevalence of workers with National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health significant threshold shifts (NSTS), Occupational Safety and Health Administration standard threshold shifts (OSTS), and with OSTS with age correction (OSTS-A), by industry using North American Industry Classification System codes.METHODS: From 2001 to 2010, worker audiograms were examined. Prevalence and adjusted prevalence ratios for NSTS were estimated by industry. NSTS, OSTS, and OSTS-A prevalences were compared by industry.RESULTS: Twenty percent of workers had an NSTS, 14% had an OSTS, and 6% had an OSTS-A. For most industries, the OSTS and OSTS-A criteria identified 28% to 36% and 66% to 74% fewer workers than the NSTS criteria, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Use of NSTS criteria allowing for earlier detection of shifts in hearing is recommended for improved prevention of occupational hearing loss."
"24646817","Dietary vitamin intake correlates with hearing thresholds in the older population: the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.","BACKGROUND: Previous animal studies have shown that vitamins may prevent age-related hearing loss. However, no concrete conclusions have been reached about the association between vitamin intake and presbycusis in humans.OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between dietary vitamin intake and hearing thresholds in adults between 50 and 80 y of age by using data from a large population-based survey.DESIGN: We used data from the 2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A pure-tone audiogram and physical examination of the ear were performed, and vitamin intake was calculated by using the 24-h recall method. Data from 1910 participants were analyzed through univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses.RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, and exposure to occupational and explosive noise, intake of vitamin C correlated with better hearing at midfrequency (2000 and 3000 Hz) (coefficient: -0.012; 95% CI: -0.022, -0.002). Dietary supplement use was positively associated with better hearing at all frequencies. The univariate analysis indicated that dietary intakes of retinol, riboflavin, niacin, and vitamin C were positively correlated with better hearing at most frequencies. In contrast, serum concentrations of vitamin D were associated with worse hearing at mid and high (4000 and 6000 Hz) frequencies.CONCLUSIONS: Dietary intake of vitamin C was associated with better hearing in the older population. Because less than one-half of elderly participants in this study consumed a sufficient amount of vitamins, and vitamin intake decreased with age, we should consider proper diet counseling to prevent hearing decline."
"24639292","Occupational noise exposure and noise-induced hearing loss are associated with work-related injuries leading to admission to hospital.","OBJECTIVE: This study focuses on work-related injuries that required admission to hospital in a population of male workers exposed to occupational noise (=80 dBA) which some displayed a hearing loss due to their exposure.METHODS: The study population count 46 550 male workers, 1670 (3.6%) of whom incurred at least one work-related injury requiring admission to hospital within a period of 5 years following hearing tests conducted between 1987 and 2005. The noise exposure and hearing loss-related data were gathered during occupational noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) screening. The hospital data were used to identify all members of the study population who were admitted, and the reason for admission. Finally, access to the death-related data made it possible to identify participants who died during the course of the study. Cox proportional hazards model taking into account hearing status, noise levels, age and cumulative duration of noise exposure at the time of the hearing test established the risk of work-related injuries leading to admission to hospital.RESULTS: For each dB of hearing loss, a statistically significant risk increase was observed (HR=1.01 dB 95% CI 1.006 to 1.01). An association (HR=2.36 95% CI 2.01 to 2.77) was also found between working in an occupational ambient noise =100 dBA and the risk of injury.CONCLUSIONS: From a safety perspective, this issue is highly relevant; especially when workers are exposed to intense ambient noise and NIHL."
"24610168","Longitudinal changes in hearing threshold levels of noise-exposed construction workers.","PURPOSE: Longitudinal analysis of audiometric data of a large population of noise-exposed workers provides insight into the development of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) as a function of noise exposure and age, particularly during the first decade of noise exposure.METHODS: Data of pure-tone audiometry of 17,930 construction workers who underwent periodic occupational hearing screening at least twice during a 4-year period were available for analysis. These concerned all follow-up measurements of the baseline cohort described by Leensen et al. (Int Arch Occup Environ Health 84:577-590, 2011). Linear mixed models explored the relationship between the annual rate of change in hearing and noise exposure level, exposure duration, and age. Data of 3,111 workers who were tested on three occasions were used to investigate the pattern of hearing loss development.RESULTS: The mean annual deterioration in hearing in this study population was 0.54 dB/yr, and this became larger with increasing noise exposure level and increasing age. Remarkably, during the first decade of noise exposure, an improvement in hearing threshold levels (HTLs) was observed. The change in hearing over three measurements showed a concave development of hearing loss as a function of time, which corresponds to NIHL development.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, hearing deteriorated over the measurement period. Because HTLs at follow-up were better than those obtained at baseline, no statement can be made about the NIHL development during the first decade of noise exposure. This improvement in HTLs rather resembles the result of measurement variation in occupational screening audiometry than an actual improvement in hearing ability."
"24605524","[Hearing loss in noisy workplaces].","Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) from prolonged occupational exposure to noise continues was described. Since a therapy against NIHL is not currently available, it is important to take actions to minimize the exposure to noise. It is also important to perform auditory controls. In October 1992, the Ministry of Labour issued &quot;Guidelines for Preventing Noise Induced Disorders&quot; in Japan. The guidelines oblige employers who hire over fifty workers to take actions to prevent NIHL at the workplace that have the equivalent noise level of 85 dB (A) or higher. In fact there are lots of noise-induced disorders at the small workplace. It should be obliged to use this guideline in all workplaces."
"24603543","Hearing loss in relation to sound exposure of professional symphony orchestra musicians.","OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to: (1) estimate the hearing status of classical symphony orchestra musicians and (2) investigate the hypothesis that occupational sound exposure of symphony orchestra musicians leads to elevated hearing thresholds.DESIGN: The study population comprised all the musicians from five symphony orchestras. Questionnaires were filled in by 337 subjects, and 212 subjects performed an audiometric test. For a group of 182 musicians (363 ears) the results of the audiometry was analyzed in relation to the individual exposure, which was estimated on the basis of sound measurements and questionnaire data regarding the exposure time. The mean hearing threshold at the frequencies 3, 4, and 6 kHz, corrected for age and sex, was used as outcome.RESULTS: The musician ears with the highest exposure (29 of 363) had an additional threshold shift of 6.3 dB compared with the 238 ears with lowest exposure. The observed hearing loss of musicians was smaller compared with the noise-induced permanent threshold shift (NIPTS) predicted from ISO1999. A remaining confounding effect of age after ISO7029 age corrections could be observed to explain the difference in observed and predicted NIPTS. However, the observed hearing loss difference between the left and the right ear of musicians was 2.5 dB (95% confidence interval 1.5-3.6), which was similar to the NIPTS predicted from ISO1999. Most of the musicians had better hearing at 3, 4, and 6 kHz for age than expected, however, 29 ears with the highest exposure above 90.4 dBA with a mean exposure time of 41.7 years had significantly elevated hearing thresholds. Trumpet players and the left ear of first violinists had significantly elevated hearing thresholds compared with other musicians.CONCLUSION: Most of the symphony orchestra musicians had better hearing than expected but they had a work-related risk of developing additional noise-induced hearing loss. The additional NITPS of the left ear compared with the right ear was at the expected level based on the cumulated sound exposure and ISO1999, indicating that performing music may induce hearing loss to the same extent as industrial noise."

The overall quality of studies was low to very low, as rated using the GRADE approach.RESULTS: One study of stricter legislation showed a favorable effect on noise levels. Three studies, of which two RCTs, did not find an effect of a HLPP. Four studies showed that better use of hearing protection devices in HLPPs decreased the risk of hearing loss. In four other studies, workers in a HLPP still had a 0.5 dB greater hearing loss at 4 kHz (95% CI - 0.5 to 1.7) than non-exposed workers. In two similar studies there was a substantial risk of hearing loss in spite of a HLPP.CONCLUSIONS: Stricter enforcement of legislation and better implementation of HLPPs can reduce noise levels in workplaces. Better evaluations of technical interventions and long-term effects are needed."
"24564696","Methods for evaluating temporal trends in noise exposure.","OBJECTIVE: Hearing conservation programs have been mandatory in many US industries since 1983. Since then, three program elements (audiometric testing, hearing protection, and training) have been the focus of much research. By comparison, little has been done on noise exposure evaluation.DESIGN: Temporal trends in time weighted average (TWA) exposures and the fraction of measurements exceeding 85 dBA were evaluated by facility, by exposure group within facility, and by individual worker within facility.STUDY SAMPLE: A large dataset (&gt; 10 000 measurements over 20 years) from eight facilities operated by a multinational aluminum manufacturing company was studied.RESULTS: Overall, exposures declined across locations over the study period. Several facilities demonstrated substantial reductions in exposure, and the results of mean noise levels and exceedance fractions generally showed good agreement. The results of analyses at the individual level diverged with analyses by facility and exposure group within facility, suggesting that individual-level analyses, while challenging, may provide important information not available from coarser levels of analysis.CONCLUSIONS: Validated metrics are needed to allow for assessment of temporal trends in noise exposure. Such metrics will improve our ability to characterize, in a standardized manner, efforts to reduce noise-induced hearing loss."

Five measurement visits were completed by participants within 14 days.RESULTS: The 50% critical difference boundaries were - 5 and 0 dB at 4 kHz and below and - 5 and 5 dB at 6 and 8 kHz. The likelihood of spurious notches due to test-retest variability was substantially lower than the likelihood of failing to detect a notched configuration when present. Correlates of variability included stimulus frequency, baseline threshold, acoustic reflectance of the ear, average noise exposure during the previous eight hours, age, and the tester's level of education in audiology.CONCLUSION: The short-term variability in 8-kHz pure-tone thresholds obtained with the TDH-39P earphone was slightly greater than at other frequencies, but this difference was not large enough to justify the disadvantages stemming from the inability to detect a 6-kHz notch."

On each trial, either wearing a device or with open ears, subjects walked along a 3000-foot line of discrete distance markers toward the auditory threat, which was not visible but still within line-of-sight over flat terrain, stopping to listen when instructed. On approach to the threat, the linear distance at first detection was measured, followed by a continued approach until positive identification occurred. Then the subject reversed direction, retreating away from the threat until detection was lost.RESULTS: ANOVA and post hoc tests were applied to determine statistically-significant differences among HPEDs, TCAPS, and the open ear on the objective detection and identification distance measures.CONCLUSIONS: The results have serious implications for selection of HPDs, HPEDs, and TCAPS for applications where preservation of auditory situational awareness via the fundamental detection and identification tasks are essential."

The present study is the first to report such data. Prevalence of tinnitus and use of hearing aids is also reported.DESIGN: The research was conducted using the UK Biobank resource. The better-ear unaided speech reception threshold was measured adaptively using the Digit Triplet Test (n = 164,770). Self-report data on tinnitus, hearing aid use, noise exposure, as well as demographic variables were collected.RESULTS: Overall, 10.7% of adults (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.5-10.9%) had significant hearing impairment. Prevalence of tinnitus was 16.9% (95%CI 16.6-17.1%) and hearing aid use was 2.0% (95%CI 1.9-2.1%). Odds of hearing impairment increased with age, with a history of work- and music-related noise exposure, for lower socioeconomic background and for ethnic minority backgrounds. Males were at no higher risk of hearing impairment than females.CONCLUSIONS: Around 1 in 10 adults aged 40 to 69 years have substantial hearing impairment. The reasons for excess risk of hearing impairment particularly for those from low socioeconomic and ethnic minority backgrounds require identification, as this represents a serious health inequality. The underuse of hearing aids has altered little since the 1980s, and is a major cause for concern."
"24509531","Predicting hearing thresholds in occupational noise-induced hearing loss by auditory steady state responses.","OBJECTIVES: Currently available behavioral tools for the assessment of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) depend on the reliable cooperation of the subject. Furthermore, in workers' compensation cases, there is considerable financial gain to be had from exaggerating symptoms, such that accurate assessment of true hearing threshold levels is essential. An alternative objective physiologic tool for assessing NIHL is the auditory steady state response (ASSR) test, which combines frequency specificity with a high level of auditory stimulation, making it applicable for the evaluation of subjects with a moderate to severe deficit. The primary aim of the study was to assess the value of the multifrequency ASSR test in predicting the behavioral warble-tone audiogram in a large sample of young subjects with NIHL of varying severity or with normal hearing. The secondary goal was to assess suprathreshold ASSR growth functions in these two groups.DESIGN: The study group included 157 subjects regularly exposed to high levels of occupational noise, who attended a university-associated audiological clinic for evaluation of NIHL from 2009 through 2011. All underwent a behavioral audiogram, and on the basis of the findings, were divided into those with NIHL (108 subjects, 216 ears) or normal hearing (49 subjects, 98 ears). The accuracy of the ASSR threshold estimations for frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz was compared between groups, and the specificity and sensitivity of the ASSR test in differentiating ears with or without NIHL was calculated using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Linear regression analysis was used to formulate an equation to predict the behavioral warble-tone audiogram at each test frequency using ASSR thresholds. Multifrequency ASSR amplitude growth as a function of stimulus intensity was compared between the NIHL and normal-hearing groups for 1000 Hz and 4000 Hz carrier frequencies.RESULTS: In the subjects with NIHL, ASSR thresholds to various frequencies were significantly and highly correlated with the behavioral warble-tone thresholds; Pearson correlation coefficients ranged from 0.6 to 0.8 over the four frequencies tested. Differences between thresholds ranged from 10 to 13 dB. The configuration of the ASSR waveforms closely approximated the behavioral audiogram. The sensitivity for screening hearing thresholds was 92%; by frequency, sensitivity ranged between 92.7 and 98.4%, but specificity was lower, especially at the low frequencies. ASSR accurately predicted moderate and severe NIHL. The mean ASSR growth amplitude to increasing stimulus level for 1000 and 4000 Hz was significantly steeper in the NIHL than in the normal-hearing group, with no significant difference between frequencies.CONCLUSIONS: The ASSR test has a high sensitivity to detect moderate to severe hearing loss in subjects with NIHL. Its use can facilitate the early identification of noise-exposed workers with NIHL. It may also serve an important medico-legal function in cases of workers' compensation. The ASSR test is not, by itself, an appropriate tool for hearing screening in the general population."
"24438539","Hearing assessment in dental practitioners and other academic professionals from an urban setting.","INTRODUCTION: Extended exposure to high-speed handpieces and other noise-intensive devices might put dentists at risk for possible hearing impairment. The aim of this study was to determine the hearing ability of dentists and other scientists for comparison.METHODS: After approval by the ethics committee, 115 subjects (dentists and other academic professionals as controls) of both genders were enrolled in the study. Exclusion criteria were colds, ear-blockages or abnormal hearing-thresholds. An audiometric determination (Oscilla USB audiometer, AudioConsole 3, Inmedico A/S, Denmark) was performed in the frequency range of 125 Hz to 8 kHz for both ears. Anamnestic data and number of years in the profession were assessed using a questionnaire. Differences between groups were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney-U-test.RESULTS: Data from 53 dentists and 55 other academic professionals (69.4% male, 30.6% female) with a mean age of 51.7 ± 9.6 years and similar gender distributions in both groups were analyzed. The audiometric tests for the right and left air conduction showed that the hearing of dentists tended to be slightly more impaired than in the control subjects. For the frequencies 3 kHz and 4 kHz these differences were statistically significant for both ears. In contrast, no significant differences were found in this range for bone conduction.CONCLUSIONS: Hearing impairment in dentists was slightly higher than in controls. Although other factors like environmental noise exposure were comparable for both groups, occupational exposure to high-speed handpieces and other noisy devices can be an additional burden for the hearing."

Tone threshold audiometry for conventional (from 500 to 8,000 Hz) and high frequencies was applied (from 9,000 to 16,000 Hz).RESULTS: Exposure to music triggered permanent hearing impairment. As to conventional auditory thresholds, the exposed and non-exposed groups presented sensorineural hearing loss of 32 and 2.27%, respectively. The subjects exposed to music had 14.54 times more risks of acquiring sensorineural hearing loss than the non-exposed group. After 20 years of exposure to music, significant worsening was observed in auditory thresholds, especially at extended high frequencies, and differences occurred between the groups from the age of 30 on.CONCLUSION: Exposure to music caused permanent hearing impairment, showing differences in relation to the non-exposed group, registered in conventional audiometry and at high-frequency audiometry."

Methods In a retrospective and cross-sectional study, 13 fishermen (mean 45.0), between 33 and 62 years of age, were submitted to anamnesis, otorhinolaryngological evaluation, and vestibular exam through the vector electronystagmography. Results The most evident otoneurologic symptoms were hearing loss (76.9%), tinnitus (61.7%), dizziness (46.1%), and headache (46.1%). The most evident clinical symptoms were fatigue (46.1%), depression (23.0%), anxiety (15.3%), insomnia (7.7%), and agitation during sleep (7.7%). There were alterations in the vestibular exam in 5 fishermen (38.5%) discovered in the caloric test. There was a prevalence of alteration in the peripheral vestibular system. There was a major frequency of the peripheral vestibular irritative syndrome. Conclusion The otoneurologic complaints were frequent in the population studied to verify the importance of allowing labyrinth exams and the need for adopting preventive measures relating to noise exposure as well as carbon monoxide exposure, because they can cause and/or enhance various manifestations of labyrinthine vestibular impairment that can affect the quality of life of these workers.

"25812386","The influence of jet engine noise on hearing of technical staff.","BACKGROUND: Due to high sound pressure levels (SPLs), noise produced by jet planes may be harmful to hearing of people working in their proximity. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of exposure to jet engine noise on technical staff hearing.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprised 60 men, aged 24-50 years, employed in army as technical staff and exposed to jet engine noise for 6-20 years. The control group were 50 non-noise exposed males, aged 25-51 years. Exposure to noise emitted by jet engines was evaluated. Pure-tone audiometry (PTA) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) were recorded in both groups.RESULTS: Jet engines emitted broadband noise with spectrum dominated by components in the frequency range 315-6300 Hz (1/3-octave bands). Maximum A-weighted SPL during tests reached values of approx. 120-130 dB. Consequently, engine-servicing personnel (even in the case of a single engine test) was exposed to noise (at A-weighted daily noise exposure level above 95 dB) exceeding permissible levels. Averaged audiometric hearing threshold levels of technical staff were higher (= 17 dB HL, p &lt; 0.001) than in the control group. Similarly, the DPOAE amplitude was lower (= 17 dB SPL, p &lt; 0.01) in the noise-exposed subjects compared to the non-exposed ones. Significant reduction of DPOAE levels was mainly noted for high frequencies (3-6 kHz).CONCLUSIONS: Despite the usage of hearing protection devices, both PTA and DPOAE consistently showed poorer hearing in engine-servicing personnel vs. control group."
"26700251","Arsenic related hearing loss in miners.","PURPOSE: Arsenic is a toxic metalloid that carries number of potential risks to human health, although there is little evidence of the ototoxic effect of arsenic. The aim of this study was to identify the relationship between arsenic exposure and hearing loss by measuring blood arsenic concentrations and hearing among miners.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This research is a retrospective case control study. Included in the study were miners employed in a single silver mine whose blood arsenic concentrations were high. A comparison was made on the pure tone audiometry measurements taken from miners exposed only to arsenic (Group 1), those exposed to both arsenic and noise (Group 2) and a control group exposed to neither arsenic nor noise (Group 3).RESULTS: It was found that for both ears at all frequencies, the hearing level of Group 3 was better than the hearing levels of both Group 1 and Group 2. There was no correlation between the blood arsenic levels and hearing levels in both ears.CONCLUSION: This study has revealed the ototoxic effects of arsenic. As blood arsenic concentrations do not reflect long-term exposure, no correlation was identified between blood arsenic concentrations and hearing levels. Further studies will be needed to clarify the mechanisms involved in the effect of arsenic on hearing. This paper represents the largest study to date focusing on the isolated effects of arsenic on hearing through the use of a clinical auditory test."
"26691614","Training on hearing protector insertion improves noise attenuation.","PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy of hearing protector insertion by comparing attenuation values measured by objective (MIRE) and subjective (REAT) methods in groups with and without training.METHODS: The study included 80 male subjects assigned to experimental (with training) and control (without training) groups. The following procedures were performed: occupational history, objective and subjective assessment of hearing protectors. Only subjects in the experimental group received training and guidance on proper hearing protector insertion.RESULTS: Attenuation values were significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group at all frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz) investigated through the objective (MIRE) and subjective (REAT) methods. In addition, attenuation values in the control group were lower than those provided by the hearing protector manufacturer.CONCLUSION: Both objective and subjective attenuation tests demonstrated the efficacy of training on insertion of hearing protectors because the group that received training on proper hearing protection insertion exhibited higher attenuation values than the untrained group."
"26642893","Cardiovascular risk factors and hearing loss: The HUNT study.","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present paper was to examine the association between prospectively and cross-sectionally assessed cardiovascular risk factors and hearing loss.DESIGN: Hearing was assessed by pure-tone average thresholds at low (0.25-0.5 kHz), middle (1-2 kHz), and high (3-8 kHz) frequencies. Self-reported or measured cardiovascular risk factors were assessed both 11 years before and simultaneously with the audiometric assessment. Cardiovascular risk factors were smoking, alcohol use, physical inactivity, waist circumference, body mass index, resting heart rate, blood pressure, triglycerides, total serum cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and diabetes.STUDY SAMPLE: A population-based cohort of 31 547 subjects.RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, level of education, income, recurrent ear infections, and noise exposure, risk factors associated with poorer hearing sensitivity were smoking, diabetes, physical inactivity, resting heart rate, and waist circumference. Smoking was only associated with hearing loss at high frequencies. The effects were very small, in combination explaining only 0.2-0.4% of the variance in addition to the component explained by age and the other cofactors.CONCLUSION: This cohort study indicates that, although many cardiovascular risk factors are associated with hearing loss, the effects are small and of doubtful clinical relevance."

"26572701","Hearing loss and tinnitus in rock musicians: A Norwegian survey.","Our focus in this study was to assess hearing thresholds and the prevalence and characteristics of tinnitus in a large group of rock musicians based in Norway. A further objective was to assess related factors such as exposure, instrument category, and the preventive effect of hearing protection. The study was a cross-sectional survey of rock musicians selected at random from a defined cohort of musicians. A random control group was included for comparison. We recruited 111 active musicians from the Oslo region, and a control group of 40 nonmusicians from the student population at the University of TromsØ. The subjects were investigated using clinical examination, pure tone audiometry, tympanometry, and a questionnaire. We observed a hearing loss in 37.8% of the rock musicians. Significantly poorer hearing thresholds were seen at most pure-tone frequencies in musicians than controls, with the most pronounced threshold shift at 6 kHz. The use of hearing protection, in particular custom-fitted earplugs, has a preventive effect but a minority of rock musicians apply them consistently. The degree of musical performance exposure was inversely related to the degree of hearing loss in our sample. Bass and guitar players had higher hearing thresholds than vocalists. We observed a 20% prevalence of chronic tinnitus but none of the affected musicians had severe tinnitus symptomatology. There was no statistical association between permanent tinnitus and hearing loss in our sample. We observed an increased prevalence of hearing loss and tinnitus in our sample of Norwegian rock musicians but the causal relationship between musical exposure and hearing loss or tinnitus is ambiguous. We recommend the use of hearing protection in rock musicians. "
"26549131","Comparison of distortion product otoacoustic emissions and pure tone audiometry in occupational screening for auditory deficit due to noise exposure.","OBJECTIVE: To examine whether distortion product otoacoustic emissions can serve as a replacement for pure tone audiometry in longitudinal screening for occupational noise exposure related auditory deficit.METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of pure tone audiometry and distortion product otoacoustic emission data obtained sequentially during mandatory screening of brickyard workers (n = 16). Individual pure tone audiometry thresholds were compared with distortion product otoacoustic emission amplitudes, and a correlation of these measurements was conducted.RESULTS: Pure tone audiometry threshold elevation was identified in 13 out of 16 workers. When distortion product otoacoustic emission amplitudes were compared with pure tone audiometry thresholds at matched frequencies, no evidence of a robust relationship was apparent. Seven out of 16 workers had substantial distortion product otoacoustic emissions with elevated pure tone audiometry thresholds.CONCLUSION: No clinically relevant predictive relationship between distortion product otoacoustic emission amplitude and pure tone audiometry threshold was apparent. These results do not support the replacement of pure tone audiometry with distortion product otoacoustic emissions in screening. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions at frequencies associated with elevated pure tone audiometry thresholds are evidence of intact outer hair cell function, suggesting that sites distinct from these contribute to auditory deficit following ototrauma."
"26536965","Exposure to excessive sounds during orchestra rehearsals and temporary hearing changes in hearing among musicians.","BACKGROUND: It has been shown that musicians are at risk of noise-induced hearing loss. The aim of the study has been to evaluate the temporary changes of hearing in the case of orchestral musicians after group rehearsals.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group comprised 18 orchestral musicians, aged 30-58 years old (mean: 40 years old) having 12-40 years (mean: 22 years) of professional experience. The temporary changes in hearing after group rehearsals were determined using transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs). Noise exposures during group rehearsals were also evaluated.RESULTS: Musicians' hearing threshold levels were higher (worse) than expected for the equivalent non-noise-exposed population. Moreover, the high frequency notched audiograms were observed in some of them. After rehearsals, during which musicians were exposed to orchestral noise at A-weighted equivalent-continuous sound pressure level (normalized to 8-h working day) varied from 75.6-83.1 dB (mean: 79.4 dB). The significant post-exposure reductions of TEOAE amplitudes (approx. 0.7 dB) both for the total response and frequency bands of 2000 and 3000 Hz were noted. However, there were no significant differences between pre- and postexposure reproducibility of TEOAE.CONCLUSIONS: Obtained results have confirmed that orchestral musicians are at risk of hearing loss due to their professional activities, even at exposures to orchestral noise less than the limit values for occupational noise.Wykazano, ze muzycy narazeni sa na ryzyko utraty sluchu wywolanej halasem.

This study investigated the validity of an automated mobile diagnostic audiometer with increased attenuation and real-time noise monitoring for clinical testing outside a sound booth.DESIGN: Attenuation characteristics and reference ambient noise levels for the computer-based audiometer (KUDUwave) was evaluated alongside the validity of environmental noise monitoring. Clinical validity was determined by comparing air- and bone-conduction thresholds obtained inside and outside the sound booth (23 subjects).STUDY SAMPLE: Twenty-three normal-hearing subjects (age range, 20-75 years; average age 35.5) and a sub group of 11 subjects to establish test-retest reliability.RESULTS: Improved passive attenuation and valid environmental noise monitoring was demonstrated. Clinically, air-conduction thresholds inside and outside the sound booth, corresponded within 5 dB or less &gt; 90% of instances (mean absolute difference 3.3 ± 3.2 SD). Bone conduction thresholds corresponded within 5 dB or less in 80% of comparisons between test environments, with a mean absolute difference of 4.6 dB (3.7 SD). Threshold differences were not statistically significant. Mean absolute test-retest differences outside the sound booth was similar to those in the booth.CONCLUSION: Diagnostic pure-tone audiometry outside a sound booth, using automated testing, improved passive attenuation, and real-time environmental noise monitoring demonstrated reliable hearing assessments."
"26512589","Association Between Hearing Impairment and Albuminuria in the Korean Adults: The 2011-2012 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.","Although the associations between albuminuria and renal and cardiovascular diseases, including diabetes and hypertension, have been extensively studied, few studies have investigated the association between albuminuria and hearing impairment. In this study, we assessed the relationship between albuminuria and hearing impairment in 9786 adult Korean subjects, using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) performed in 2011-2012. The range of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) was divided into 4 grades: grade 1 (first tertile of low-grade albuminuria [LGA]), 0.00 to 1.99<U+200A>mg/g Cr; grade 2 (second tertile of LGA), 2.00 to 5.49<U+200A>mg/g Cr; grade 3 (third tertile of LGA), 5.50 to 29.99<U+200A>mg/g Cr; grade 4 (albuminuria), =30.00<U+200A>mg/g Cr.The age- and sex-adjusted weighted UACR was higher in subjects with hearing impairment compared with those without hearing impairment (26.2<U+200A>±<U+200A>4.7<U+200A>mg/g Cr vs 14.1<U+200A>±<U+200A>1.5<U+200A>mg/g Cr, P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.020). The age- and sex-adjusted weighted prevalence of albuminuria was also higher in subjects with hearing impairment compared with subjects without hearing impairment. (8.3<U+200A>±<U+200A>0.9% vs 5.8<U+200A>±<U+200A>0.4%, P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.013) The age- and sex-adjusted weighted percentage of hearing impairment increased as UACR increased (18.0%<U+200A>±<U+200A>0.6%, 20.0%<U+200A>±<U+200A>0.8%, 22.2%<U+200A>±<U+200A>0.9%, 25.3%<U+200A>±<U+200A>2.0%, respectively; P<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>0.001). Logistic regression analyses were performed for hearing impairment by albuminuria, with age, sex, tobacco use, heavy alcohol use, educational background, occupational noise exposure, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, total serum cholesterol, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60<U+200A>mL/min/1.73<U+200A>m as covariates. Using grade 1 of UACR as the control, grade 3 (odds ratio [OR] 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.53, P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.005) and grade 4 (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.04-1.90, P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.026) of UACR were correlated with hearing impairment, respectively. When the level of hearing impairment (dB) was analyzed as a continuous variable, it was positively correlated with log UACR (Spearman correlation, unadjusted r<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.226, adjusted r<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.076, P<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>0.001).In conclusion, we are the first to demonstrate that albuminuria is associated with hearing impairment in the Korean general population, using nationally representative data. Screening for albuminuria would allow for interventions for the prevention of hearing impairment."

"26502292","Asymmetric Hearing Loss in Chinese Workers Exposed to Complex Noise.","OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the audiometric asymmetry in Chinese industrial workers and investigate the effects of noise exposure, sex, and binaural average thresholds on audiometric asymmetry.DESIGN: Data collected from Chinese industrial workers during a cross-sectional study were reanalyzed. Of the 1388 workers, 266 met the inclusion criteria for this study. Each subject underwent a physical examination and an otologic examination and completed a health-related questionnaire. <U+03C7> and t tests were used to examine the differences between the asymmetric and symmetric hearing loss groups.RESULTS: One hundred thirty-one subjects (49.2%) had a binaural hearing threshold difference of 15 dB or more for at least one frequency, and there was no statistically significant difference between the left and right ears. The asymmetric hearing loss group was not exposed to higher cumulative noise levels (t = 0.522, p = 0.602), and there was no dose-response relation between asymmetry and cumulative noise levels (<U+03C7> = 6.502, p = 0.165). Men were 1.849 times more likely to have asymmetry than women were (95% confidence interval, 1.051 to 3.253). Among the workers with higher high-frequency hearing thresholds, audiometric asymmetry was 1.024 times more prevalent than that among those with lower high-frequency hearing thresholds (95% confidence interval, 1.004 to 1.044).CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that occupational noise exposure contributed minimally to asymmetry, whereas sex and binaural average thresholds significantly affected audiometric asymmetry. There was no evidence that the left ears were worse than the right ears."

"26487294","Gender and other factors associated with the use of hearing protection devices at work.","OBJECTIVE: To analyze whether sociodemographic, occupational, and health-related data are associated with the use of hearing protection devices at work, according to gender.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2006, using a random sample of 2,429 workers, aged between 18 and 65 years old, from residential sub-areas in Salvador, BA, Northeastern Brazil. Questionnaires were used to obtain sociodemographic, occupational, and health-related data. Workers who reported that they worked in places where they needed to shout in order to be heard were considered to be exposed to noise. Exposed workers were asked whether they used hearing protection devices, and if so, how frequently. Analyses were conducted according to gender, with estimates made about prevalence of the use of hearing protection devices, prevalence ratios, and their respective 95% confidence intervals.RESULTS: Twelve percent (12.3%) of study subjects reported that they were exposed to noise while working. Prevalence of the use of hearing protection devices was 59.3% for men and 21.4% for women. Men from higher socioeconomic levels (PR = 1.47; 95%CI 1.14;1.90) and who had previous audiometric tests (PR = 1.47; 95%CI 1.15;1.88) were more likely to use hearing protection devices. For women, greater perceived safety was associated with the use of protection devices (PR = 2.92; 95%CI 1.34;6.34). This perception was specifically related to the presence of supervisors committed to safety (PR = 2.09; 95%CI 1.04;4.21), the existence of clear rules to prevent workplace injuries (PR = 2.81; 95%CI 1.41;5.59), and whether they were informed about workplace safety (PR = 2.42; 95%CI 1.23;4.76).CONCLUSIONS: There is a gender bias regarding the use of hearing protection devices that is less favorable to women. The use of such devices among women is positively influenced by their perception of a safe workplace, suggesting that gender should be considered as a factor in hearing conservation programs."
"26470945","Hearing conservation in the primary aluminium industry.","BACKGROUND: Noise-induced hearing loss has been an intractable problem for heavy industry.AIMS: To report our experience in reducing the incidence of age-corrected confirmed 10 dB hearing shifts (averaged over 2, 3 and 4 kHz) in employees in the primary aluminium industry in Australia over the period 2006-13.METHODS: We analysed annual audiometric data to determine the number of permanent hearing shifts that occurred in employees in two bauxite mines, three alumina refineries and two aluminium smelters. Annual hearing shift rates were calculated based on the number of employees tested per year. Hearing conservation initiatives undertaken during the study period are described. An assessment of similar exposure group noise exposures was also undertaken to determine the magnitude of noise exposure reduction during the study period.RESULTS: Across all operations, hearing shift rates declined from 5.5% per year in 2006 to 1.3% per year in 2013 (P &lt; 0.001). The decline in shift rates was greater in mines and refineries, where baseline shift rates were higher, than in smelter workers. Modest reductions in noise exposure occurred during the study period.CONCLUSIONS: We observed a substantial decline in hearing shift rates during the study period. We describe the hearing conservation initiatives that were collectively associated with this decline. We suspect these initiatives could be deployed relatively easily and at modest cost in other industries with noise-exposed employees."
"26443047","Is this STS work-related? ISO 1999 predictions as an adjunct to clinical judgment.","BACKGROUND: Physicians and audiologists are often asked to decide whether standard threshold shifts (STSs) are work-related; epidemiological data can inform these decisions.METHODS: Predictions of ISO (2013) for both age-related and noise-induced threshold shifts, for the 2, 3, and 4 kHz average used in calculating OSHA STSs, are presented, in tables, graphs, and an Excel spreadsheet calculator. Specifically, the ISO 1999 model estimates age-related thresholds based on age and sex; it estimates noise-induced threshold shifts based on noise level and duration. It specifies that to estimate the final hearing thresholds for a person of given percentile, age, sex, and noise exposure, the expected age-related threshold is to be added to the expected noise-induced threshold shift. Examples show how these data can predict the relative contributions of aging and occupational noise to an STS.RESULTS: Early-career STSs, especially with high levels of noise exposure, are more likely to be primarily noise-induced. After the first decade of exposure, most STSs will be primarily age-related.CONCLUSION: Given a worker's age, sex, and occupational noise exposure history, ISO 1999 estimates of the expected contributions of aging and noise can supplement clinical judgment."
"26398252","Perception of hearing protectors by workers that participate in hearing preservation programs: a preliminary study.","PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare the workers' perception of comfort and use aspects regarding two types of hearing protectors (shell and earplug), in three units from a lumbering company, with different implantation times for Hearing Preservation Programs.METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study comparing 440 workers' perception of hearing protectors, from three companies in Paraná State (Brazil), with different times for Hearing Preservation Programs. Two closed questionnaires were applied (9 and 10 questions, respectively), with a scale of answers varying from 1 to 5 (Likert's scale) regarding the perception of the comfort of hearing protectors. Then, audiometry results were analyzed.RESULTS: About 17.5% presented audiogram examinations with alterations. With regard to the questionnaire about the comfort perception, the importance of noise attenuation (mean of 4.25) was the most relevant aspect, followed by communication possibility (mean of 4.15). In the protector assessment, Unit A with more Hearing Preservation Program time presented better scores for both the worker's perception of important aspects regarding hearing protector and for the assessment of the used hearing protector. There was a significant difference on communication difficulty with the use of a hearing protector among workers with normal and altered audiograms (p=0.0371). With regard to the global comfort in the comparison of workers using the shell-type hearing protector with those using insert-type hearing protectors, there was no difference (p=0.2264), irrespective of the type of the unit.CONCLUSION: In general, the unit workers presented a good perception of the important aspects about the hearing protection use of both types of hearing protectors."
"26374778","Exposure to loud noise, bilateral high-frequency hearing loss and coronary heart disease.","OBJECTIVES: Bilateral high-frequency hearing loss is an indicator for chronic exposure to loud noise. This study aimed to examine the association between bilateral high-frequency hearing loss and the presence of coronary heart disease (CHD).METHODS: This study included 5223 participants aged 20-69 years who participated in the audiometry examination of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004. Bilateral high-frequency hearing loss was defined as the average high-frequency (3, 4 and 6 kHz) hearing threshold =25 dB in both ears. CHD was defined as self-reported diagnoses by doctors or other health professionals.RESULTS: Compared with those with normal high-frequency hearing, participants with bilateral high-frequency hearing loss were more likely to have CHD (OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.28 to 2.85) after adjustment for various covariates. This association was particularly strong for currently employed workers who were exposed to loud occupational noise (OR 4.23; 95% CI 1.32 to 13.55). For this subgroup, there was no significant association of CHD with unilateral high-frequency hearing loss, and unilateral or bilateral low-frequency hearing loss. Furthermore, there was no significant association of CHD with any types of hearing loss for participants who were not exposed to loud noise. Stratified analyses for participants exposed to loud noise showed that the observed association was particularly strong for those who were less than 50 years of age, less educated and current smokers.CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of an objective indicator for personal chronic exposure to loud noise, this study confirmed that exposure to loud occupational noise is associated with the presence of CHD."

"26358094","Middle Latency Auditory Evoked Potential (MLAEP) in Workers with and without Tinnitus who are Exposed to Occupational Noise.","BACKGROUND: Tinnitus is an important occupational health concern, but few studies have focused on the central auditory pathways of workers with a history of occupational noise exposure. Thus, we analyzed the central auditory pathways of workers with a history of occupational noise exposure who had normal hearing threshold, and compared middle latency auditory evoked potential in those with and without noise-induced tinnitus.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty individuals (30 with and 30 without tinnitus) underwent the following procedures: anamnesis, immittance measures, pure-tone air conduction thresholds at all frequencies between 0.25-8 kHz, and middle latency auditory evoked potentials.RESULTS: Quantitative analysis of latencies and amplitudes of middle latency auditory evoked potential showed no significant differences between the groups with and without tinnitus. In the qualitative analysis, we found that both groups showed increased middle latency auditory evoked potential latencies. The study group had more alterations of the &quot;both&quot; type regarding the Na-Pa amplitude, while the control group had more &quot;electrode effect&quot; alterations, but these alterations were not significantly different when compared to controls.CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with normal hearing with or without tinnitus who are exposed to occupational noise have altered middle latency auditory evoked potential, suggesting impairment of the auditory pathways in cortical and subcortical regions. Although differences did not reach significance, individuals with tinnitus seemed to have more abnormalities in components of the middle latency auditory evoked potential when compared to individuals without tinnitus, suggesting alterations in the generation and transmission of neuroelectrical impulses along the auditory pathway."
"26356380","Measurement of impulse peak insertion loss from two acoustic test fixtures and four hearing protector conditions with an acoustic shock tube.","Impulse peak insertion loss (IPIL) was studied with two acoustic test fixtures and four hearing protector conditions at the E-A-RCAL Laboratory. IPIL is the difference between the maximum estimated pressure for the open-ear condition and the maximum pressure measured when a hearing protector is placed on an acoustic test fixture (ATF). Two models of an ATF manufactured by the French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis (ISL) were evaluated with high-level acoustic impulses created by an acoustic shock tube at levels of 134 decibels (dB), 150 dB, and 168 dB. The fixtures were identical except that the E-A-RCAL ISL fixture had ear canals that were 3 mm longer than the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) ISL fixture. Four hearing protection conditions were tested: Combat Arms earplug with the valve open, ETYPlugs ® earplug, TacticalPro headset, and a dual-protector ETYPlugs earplug with TacticalPro earmuff. The IPILs measured for the E-A-RCAL fixture were 1.4 dB greater than the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) ISL ATF. For the E-A-RCAL ISL ATF, the left ear IPIL was 2.0 dB greater than the right ear IPIL. For the NIOSH ATF, the right ear IPIL was 0.3 dB greater than the left ear IPIL. "
"26356377","Predictive factors of occupational noise-induced hearing loss in Spanish workers: A prospective study.","The purpose of our study was to identify the main factors associated with objective noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), as indicated by abnormal audiometric testing, in Spanish workers exposed to occupational noise in the construction industry. We carried out a prospective study in Tenerife, Spain, using 150 employees exposed to occupational noise and 150 age-matched controls who were not working in noisy environments. The variables analyzed included sociodemographic data, noise-related factors, types of hearing protection, self-report hearing loss, and auditory-related symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, vertigo). Workers with pathological audiograms had significantly longer noise-exposure duration (16.2 ± 11.4 years) relative to those with normal audiograms (10.2 ± 7.0 years; t = 3.99, P &lt; 0.001). The vast majority of those who never used hearing protection measures had audiometric abnormalities (94.1%). Additionally, workers using at least one of the protection devices (earplugs or earmuffs) had significantly more audiometric abnormalities than those using both protection measures simultaneously (Chi square = 16.07; P &lt; 0.001). The logistic regression analysis indicates that the use of hearing protection measures [odds ratio (OR) = 12.30, confidence interval (CI) = 4.36-13.81, P &lt; 0.001], and noise-exposure duration (OR = 1.35, CI = 1.08-1.99, P = 0.040) are significant predictors of NIHL. This regression model correctly predicted 78.2% of individuals with pathological audiograms. The combined use of hearing protection measures, in particular earplugs and earmuffs, associates with a lower rate of audiometric abnormalities in subjects with high occupational noise exposure. The use of hearing protection measures at work and noise-exposure duration are best predictive factors of NIHL. Auditory-related symptoms and self-report hearing loss do not represent good indicators of objective NIHL. Routine monitoring of noise levels and hearing status are of great importance as part of effective hearing conservation programs. "

"26328899","Rifle impulse noise affects middle-ear compliance in soldiers wearing protective earplugs.","OBJECTIVE: We tested middle-ear functioning in humans following intense exposure to noise. Noise generated by small caliber firearms was thought to have no effect on the middle-ear.DESIGN: A cross-over design. We measured middle-ear impedance, acoustic reflex, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), and transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) before and after practice rounds performed twice per day.STUDY SAMPLE: Fifty-nine soldiers equipped with earplugs undergoing regular training for a special mission. The mean noise exposure (LAeq8h) was estimated to be 106 ±1 dB SPL.RESULTS: Impedancemetry revealed a significant increase in the compliance and gradient of the tympano-ossicular chain after impulse noise exposure in the right and left ears. Acoustic reflex reactivity did not show a significant change. DPOAEs and TEOAEs were slightly decreased at 2 kHz, and showed a marked asymmetry in disfavor of the left ear. In soldiers with initial high reactivity of acoustic reflex, increased compliance was associated with a significant decrease in left TEOAEs at 1.5 and 2 kHz.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the use of small-caliber firearms, even while wearing earplugs, affects middle-ear function and may play a role in the early stage of auditory fatigue encompassing tinnitus."
"26328697","Unmasking the effects of masking on performance: The potential of multiple-voice masking in the office environment.","Broadband noise is often used as a masking sound to combat the negative consequences of background speech on performance in open-plan offices. As office workers generally dislike broadband noise, it is important to find alternatives that are more appreciated while being at least not less effective. The purpose of experiment 1 was to compare broadband noise with two alternatives-multiple voices and water waves-in the context of a serial short-term memory task. A single voice impaired memory in comparison with silence, but when the single voice was masked with multiple voices, performance was on level with silence. Experiment 2 explored the benefits of multiple-voice masking in more detail (by comparing one voice, three voices, five voices, and seven voices) in the context of word processed writing (arguably a more office-relevant task). Performance (i.e., writing fluency) increased linearly from worst performance in the one-voice condition to best performance in the seven-voice condition. Psychological mechanisms underpinning these effects are discussed. "

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of exposure conditions on the risk of hearing loss using the Cox model. Seventy workers, employed in a press workshop, were selected to study their hearing threshold using an audiometric test. Their noise exposure histories also were analyzed. The results of the Cox model showed that the job type, smoking and the use of protection devices were effective to induce hearing loss. The relative risk of hearing loss in smokers was 1.1 times of non-smokers The relative risk of hearing loss in workers with the intermittent use of protection devices was 3.3 times those who used these devices continuously. The Cox model could analyze the effect of exposure conditions on hearing loss and provides useful information for managers in order to improve hearing conservation programs. "
"26294307","AUDITORY TEMPORAL PROCESSING TESTS - NORMATIVE DATA FOR POLISH-SPEAKING ADULTS.","BACKGROUND: Several subjects exposed to neurotoxins in the workplace need to be assessed for central auditory deficit. Although central auditory processing tests are widely used in other countries, they have not been standardized for the Polish population. The aim of the study has been to evaluate the range of reference values for 3 temporal processing tests: the duration pattern test (DPT), the frequency pattern test (FPT) and the gaps in noise test (GIN).MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 76 normal hearing individuals (38 women, 38 men) at the age of 18 to 54 years old (mean ± standard deviation: 39.4±9.1). All study participants had no history of any chronic disease and underwent a standard ENT examination.RESULTS: The reference range for the DPT was established at 55.3% or more of correct answers, while for the FPT it stood at 56.7% or more of correct answers. The mean threshold for both cars in the GIN test was defined as 6 ms. In this study there were no significant associations between the DPT, FPT and GIN results and age or gender. Symmetry between the ears in the case of the DPT, FPT and GIN was found.CONCLUSIONS: Reference ranges obtained in this study for the DPT and FPT in the Polish population are lower than reference ranges previously published for other nations while the GIN test results correspond to those published in the related literature.

"26276949","A Preliminary Analysis of Noise Exposure and Medical Outcomes for Department of Defense Military Musicians.","Noise exposure is a known occupational health hazard to those serving in the military. Previous military epidemiology studies have identified military occupations at risk of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL); however, musicians have not been specifically mentioned. The focus of military NIHL studies is usually on those service members of the combat arms occupations. This project was a preliminary examination of Department of Defense (DoD) active duty military musicians in regard to their noise exposure, annual hearing test rates, and hearing injury rates using available data sources. The analysis concluded that DoD military musicians are an underserved population in terms of hearing conservation efforts. Noise surveillance data extracted from the Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System-Industrial Hygiene showed that every musician similar exposure group (SEG) with noise survey data from 2009 to 2013 exceeded the occupation exposure level adopted by DoD Instruction 6055.12. However, only a small percentage of all DoD active duty military musicians (5.5% in the peak year of 2012) were assigned to a SEG that was actually surveyed. Hearing test data based on Current Procedural Terminology coding extracted from the Military Health System revealed that the percentage of musicians with annual hearing tests increased over the 5 years studied in all services except the Air Force. During 2013, the data showed that the Navy had the highest percentage of musicians with annual hearing tests at 70.9%, and the Air Force had the lowest at 11.4%. The Air Force had the highest percentage of hearing injuries of those musicians with annual hearing tests for all 5 years analyzed. Although noise surveillance and annual hearing tests are being conducted, they occur at a much lower rate than required for a population that is known to be overexposed to noise. "
"26240497","Analysis of Predisposing Factors for Hearing Loss in Adults.","We aimed to estimate the effects of various risk factors on hearing level in Korean adults, using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We examined data from 13,369 participants collected between 2009 and 2011. Average hearing thresholds at low (0.5, 1, and 2 kHz) and high frequencies (3, 4, and 6 kHz), were investigated in accordance with various known risk factors via multiple regression analysis featuring complex sampling. We additionally evaluated data from 4,810 participants who completed a questionnaire concerned with different types of noise exposure. Low body mass index, absence of hyperlipidemia, history of diabetes mellitus, low incomes, low educational status, and smoking were associated with elevated low frequency hearing thresholds. In addition, male sex, low body mass index, absence of hyperlipidemia, low income, low educational status, smoking, and heavy alcohol consumption were associated with elevated high frequency hearing thresholds. Participants with a history of earphone use in noisy circumstances demonstrated hearing thresholds which were 1.024 dB (95% CI: 0.176 to 1.871; P = 0.018) higher, at low-frequencies, compared to participants without a history of earphone use. Our study suggests that low BMI, absence of hyperlipidemia, low household income, and low educational status are related with hearing loss in Korean adults. Male sex, smoking, and heavy alcohol use are related with high frequency hearing loss. A history of earphone use in noisy circumstances is also related with hearing loss. "
"26169804","Age correction in monitoring audiometry: method to update OSHA age-correction tables to include older workers.","OBJECTIVES: The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Noise Standard provides the option for employers to apply age corrections to employee audiograms to consider the contribution of ageing when determining whether a standard threshold shift has occurred. Current OSHA age-correction tables are based on 40-year-old data, with small samples and an upper age limit of 60 years. By comparison, recent data (1999-2006) show that hearing thresholds in the US population have improved. Because hearing thresholds have improved, and because older people are increasingly represented in noisy occupations, the OSHA tables no longer represent the current US workforce. This paper presents 2 options for updating the age-correction tables and extending values to age 75 years using recent population-based hearing survey data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Both options provide scientifically derived age-correction values that can be easily adopted by OSHA to expand their regulatory guidance to include older workers.METHODS: Regression analysis was used to derive new age-correction values using audiometric data from the 1999-2006 US NHANES. Using the NHANES median, better-ear thresholds fit to simple polynomial equations, new age-correction values were generated for both men and women for ages 20-75 years.RESULTS: The new age-correction values are presented as 2 options. The preferred option is to replace the current OSHA tables with the values derived from the NHANES median better-ear thresholds for ages 20-75 years. The alternative option is to retain the current OSHA age-correction values up to age 60 years and use the NHANES-based values for ages 61-75 years.CONCLUSIONS: Recent NHANES data offer a simple solution to the need for updated, population-based, age-correction tables for OSHA. The options presented here provide scientifically valid and relevant age-correction values which can be easily adopted by OSHA to expand their regulatory guidance to include older workers."

Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is the most common disorder related to noise exposure. Smoking is probably associated with hearing loss. The simultaneous effect of noise and smoking on hearing is a recent concern. In this study, we assessed the simultaneous effect of noise and smoking on standard pure tone audiometry (PTA) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DP-OAEs). This was an historical cohort study on 224 workers exposed to noise who were divided into two groups: Smokers and nonsmokers. DP-OAE response amplitudes were assessed. Data were analyzed by SPSS software (version 19) using Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U test. One hundred and five subjects were smokers (case group) and 119 individuals were nonsmokers (control group). All the subjects were exposed to 91.08 + 2.29 dBA [time-weighted average (TWA) for an 8 h work shift]. Mean DP-OAE response amplitude at frequencies higher than 1,000 Hz was significantly higher in the smokers than the nonsmokers. This study showed that smoking can aggravate the effect of noise on hearing in DP-OAEs."

This study aimed to evaluate the contralateral acoustic reflex thresholds of workers exposed to high levels of noise, and to compare these results to the subjects' auditory complaints.METHODS: This clinical retrospective study evaluated 364 workers between 1998 and 2005; their contralateral acoustic reflexes were compared to auditory complaints, age, and noise exposure time by chi-squared, Fisher's, and Spearman's tests.RESULTS: The workers' age ranged from 18 to 50 years (mean=39.6), and noise exposure time from one to 38 years (mean=17.3). We found that 15.1% (55) of the workers had bilateral hearing loss, 38.5% (140) had bilateral tinnitus, 52.8% (192) had abnormal sensitivity to loud sounds, and 47.2% (172) had speech recognition impairment. The variables hearing loss, speech recognition impairment, tinnitus, age group, and noise exposure time did not show relationship with acoustic reflex thresholds; however, all complaints demonstrated a statistically significant relationship with Metz recruitment at 3000 and 4000Hz bilaterally.CONCLUSION: There was no significance relationship between auditory complaints and acoustic reflexes."
"26096986","Correlation Between Acoustic Measurements and Self-Reported Voice Disorders Among Female Teachers.","OBJECTIVE: Many studies focused on teachers' voice problems and most of them were conducted using questionnaires, whereas little research has investigated the relationship between self-reported voice disorders and objective quantification of voice. This study intends to explore the relationship of acoustic measurements according to self-reported symptoms and its predictive value of future dysphonia.STUDY DESIGN: This is a case-control study.METHODS: Voice samples of 80 female teachers were analyzed, including 40 self-reported voice disorders (VD) and 40 self-reported normal voice (NVD) subjects. The acoustic measurements included jitter, shimmer, and noise-to-harmonics ratio (NHR). Levene's t test and logistic regression were used to analyze the differences between VD and NVD and the relationship between self-reported voice conditions and the acoustic measurements. To examine whether acoustic measurements can be used to predict further voice disorders, we applied a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to determine the cutoff values and the associated sensitivity and specificity.RESULTS: The results showed that jitter, shimmer, and the NHR of VD were significantly higher than those of NVD. Among the parameters, the NHR and shimmer demonstrated the highest correlation with self-reported voice disorders. By using the NHR =0.138 and shimmer =0.470 dB as the cutoff values, the ROC curve displayed 72.5% of sensitivity and 75% of specificity, and the overall positive predictive value for subsequent dysphonia achieved 60%.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a significant correlation between acoustic measurements and self-reported dysphonic symptoms. NHR and ShdB are two acoustic parameters that are more able to reflect vocal abnormalities and, probably, to predict subsequent subjective voice disorder. Future research recruiting more subjects in other occupations and genders shall validate the preliminary results revealed in this study."

More and more evidences suggested that Catalase (CAT) gene polymorphism plays an important role in the development of NIHL. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of CAT gene polymorphisms with NIHL in a case-control study.DESIGN: A total of 719 unrelated adult Chinese Han population, including 225 healthy volunteers and 494 noise-exposed workers were recruited in this study. Six tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) were genotyped using an improved multiplex ligation detection reaction technique. Subsequently, the interaction between noise exposure level and genotypes and their effect on NIHL were analyzed using logistic regression.RESULTS: Among six tSNPs, two of them (rs208679 and rs769217) were significantly associated with noise exposure level. For rs208679 recessive effect, GG genotype had a significantly increased of NIHL risk in the exposure level of &lt;85 dB; and for rs769217 dominant effect, the combined genotypes TT/TC had a significantly increased of NIHL risk in the exposure level of 85 dB~92 dB; and the haplotype A-G-T-C-A-C had a risk effect on the NIHL in the exposure level of 85 dB~92 dB. In addition, the rs769217 polymorphism could enhance the transcription activities of the CAT gene.CONCLUSIONS: This study identified CAT is a NIHL susceptibility gene when noise exposure levels are taken into account. Rs208679 and rs769217 polymorphisms might be used as relevant risk estimates for the development of NIHL in population with different noise exposure levels."
"26042421","Occupational Hearing Loss among Chinese Municipal Solid Waste Landfill Workers: A Cross-Sectional Study.","BACKGROUND: Occupational hearing loss is an increasingly prevalent occupational condition worldwide, and has been reported to occur in a wide range of workplaces; however, its prevalence among workers from municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLs) remains less clear. This study aimed to investigate the occupational hearing loss among Chinese MSWL workers.METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 247 workers from 4 Chinese MSWLs was conducted. Noise and total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) levels at worksites were determined. We conducted hearing examinations to determine hearing thresholds. A worker was identified as having hearing loss if the mean threshold at 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hz in either ear was equal to or greater than 25 dB. Prevalence of occupational hearing loss was then evaluated. Using unconditional Logistic regression models, we estimated the odds ratios (ORs) of MSWL work associated with hearing loss.RESULTS: According to the job title for each worker, the study subjects were divided into 3 groups, including group 1 of 63 workers without MSWL occupational hazards exposure (control group), group 2 of 84 workers with a few or short-period MSWL occupational hazards exposure, and group 3 of 100 workers with continuous MSWL occupational hazards exposure. Both noise and TVOCs levels were significantly higher at worksites for group 3. Significantly poorer hearing thresholds at frequencies of 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hz were found in group 3, compared with that in group 1 and group 2. The overall prevalence rate of hearing loss was 23.5%, with the highest in group 3 (36.0%). The OR of MSWL work associated with hearing loss was 3.39 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28-8.96).CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest significantly higher prevalence of hearing loss among MSWL workers. Further studies are needed to explore possible exposure-response relationship between MSWL occupational hazards exposure and hearing loss."
"26023884","Systematic Evaluation of the Relationship between Physical and Psychoacoustical Measurements of Hearing Protectors' Attenuation.","The most commonly used methods to measure hearing protectors attenuation can be divided into two categories: psychoacoustical (subjective) and physical (objective) methods. In order to better understand the relationship between these methods, this article presents various factors relating attenuation values obtained with these methods through a series of tests. Experiments on human subjects were carried out where the subjects were instrumented on both ears with miniature microphones outside and underneath the protector. The subjects were then asked to go through a series of hearing threshold measurements (psychoacoustical method) followed by microphone sound recordings using high-level diffuse field broadband noises (physical method). The proposed test protocol allowed obtaining various factors relating the test methods as well as attenuation values and ratings for different protection conditions (open ear, earmuffs, earplugs, and dual protection). Results are presented for three models of passive earmuffs, three models of earplugs and all their combinations as dual hearing protectors. The validity and the relative importance of various terms used to correct the physical attenuation values when comparing with psychoacoustical attenuation values are examined. "

Objective To analyze the noise exposure in the Brazilian forestry industry workers and the effects on hearing. Methods The study sample comprised 109 employees of a company that specialized in reforestation. Their participants' mean age was 35.5 years (21 to 54 years), mean tenure at the company was 3.9 years (1 to 13 years), and mean total duration of noise exposure was 12.3 years (1 to 30 years). The existing documentation reporting on the jobs risk analysis was examined, noise level was measured, and pure tone audiometry was performed in all participants. Participants were divided into three groups according to their noise exposure levels in their current job. Results Of the participants who were exposed to noise levels less than 85 dBA (decibels with A-weighting filter), 23.8% had hearing loss, and 5.5% of the participants who were exposed to noise ranging from 85 to 89.9 dBA and 11% of the participants who were exposed to noise greater than 90 dBA had audiogram results suggestive of NIHL. Conclusion The implementation of a hearing loss prevention program tailored to forestry workers is needed. "

These effects cannot be explained by differences in HPA axis response but recent studies saying that chronic stress induced limbic system alterations spread to nonlimbic areas affecting auditory system might be the key. On the other hand we know that subjects exposed to chronic stress may prove hypersensitivity to novel stressors. The aim of this study is to confirm that occupational chronic stress (OCS) exposure determines vulnerability to acoustic trauma and to establish a method to identify individuals at risk prior to their exposure to high intensity acoustic stimulus.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 60 military personnel with known acoustic trauma injury evidentiated through audiograms and occupational chronic stress exposure quantified through validated questionnaires were exposed to mild novel stressor: occupational medicine evaluation and clinically assessed for maladaptive cardiovascular response (MCVR). Employees were split in two groups, group 1 (MCVR) and group 2 (non MCVR).RESULTS: We found positive correlation between level of perceived OCS and level of hearing loss on entire group and between groups with values of parameters significantly higher in group 1. Subjects exposed to OCS with hypersensitivity to novel stressor evidentiated through maladaptive cardiovascular stress response may be more vulnerable to high intensity acoustic stimulus and consequently acoustic trauma.CONCLUSIONS: Establishing methods and biomarkers that help us indentify individuals at risk of developing acoustic trauma might decrease the high burden of hearing loss."
"25945769","Hearing loss associated with long-term exposure to high-speed dental handpieces.","The purpose of this study was to record and compare audiometric pure tone thresholds of dental clinicians (DCs), dental professionals (DPs), and dental students (DSs); determine the percentage of these groups who use hearing protection devices while at work in the clinic; and measure the sound intensities generated by a few representative high-speed handpieces while they are being used on patients. Participants included DCs who regularly used these handpieces (n = 16), DPs who did not use these handpieces (n = 13), and DSs (n = 8). A questionnaire was used to collect demographic information, assess occupational and recreational noise exposure, and note the level of hearing protection used. A sound level meter was used to measure the sound intensity generated by dental instruments near a clinician's ear. Results showed that DCs who regularly used high-speed handpieces had worse hearing than did members of the other study groups. These results indicate that the implementation of protective strategies should help to reduce the prevalence of occupational hearing loss among DCs. "
"25919036","Evaluation of noise-induced hearing loss by auditory steady-state and auditory brainstem-evoked responses.","OBJECTIVES: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) may result from occupational noise exposures and is considered as an 'Occupational Disease'; therefore, it is compensable. To verify the existence and severity of the work-related hearing loss, there is a need of an objective, reliable auditory measure in cases of arbitration of financial disputes to resolve any medicolegal aspects. The objective of the study was to compare between the ABR and ASSR for predicting the behavioural threshold in subjects with normal hearing or NIHL.DESIGN: The study included 82 subjects regularly exposed to high levels of occupational noise, with normal hearing and NIHL. ABR to clicks and to tone bursts were recorded followed by multiple-frequency ASSR. Physiological and behavioural thresholds were compared for specific frequencies (1000, 2000 Hz) and average of high-frequency range (2000 and 4000 Hz). In addition, Pearson correlations and the specificity and sensitivity of each measure were also calculated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.RESULTS: In the NIHL group, there was a significantly smaller difference between the behavioural threshold and click-ABR than the ASSR in high-frequency range. Pearson correlations were significantly higher for click-ABR. Analysis of specific frequencies yielded a smaller difference between behavioural and ASSR than tone-burst-ABR thresholds, with a slightly better correlation for ASSR than tone-burst-ABR. Higher sensitivity but lower specificity was suggested for ASSR than ABR.CONCLUSIONS: ASSR is associated with high-frequency specificity, shorter test sessions and good correlations with behavioural thresholds, making it a potentially better measure than ABR for predicting audiograms in subjects with NIHL. These findings have diagnostic implications, especially in cases of workers' compensation when subjects may be uncooperative."

Tympanometry and pure-tone audiometry was performed in sound isolated rooms.STUDY SAMPLE: The study sample consists of 2143 pupils attending grade nine in any school in a German city 2009-2011 (mean age: 15.4 years; range: 13-19 years). Audiometric data were available for 1837 (85.8%) pupils (53.9% girls).RESULTS: 41.9% of the 2143 adolescents who had provided self-reported data on leisure activities associated with noise exposure were estimated to be hazardously exposed to leisure time noise. The interaction of gender with total leisure time noise exposure was not significant. No association between leisure time noise exposure and audiometric notches could be detected.CONCLUSION: While hearing loss seems seldom in this age group, a high proportion of adolescents aged 15-16 years are exposed to noise levels during leisure time bearing long-term risks of hearing loss."
"25786947","Subjective and objective rating of spectrally different pseudorandom noises--implications for speech masking design.","Artificial sound masking is increasingly used in open-plan offices to improve speech privacy and to reduce distraction caused by speech sounds. Most of the masking sounds are based on pseudorandom continuous noise filtered to a specific spectrum that should be optimized in respect with speech masking efficiency and comfort. The aim of this study was to increase basic understanding regarding the comfort. The second aim was to determine how well objective rating methods (15 different noise indices) predict the subjective ratings. Twenty-three subjects rated the loudness, disturbance, pleasantness, and six other subjective measures of 11 spectrally different noises in laboratory conditions. Speech was not present during the experiment. All sounds were presented at 42<U+2009>dB LAeq within 50-10,000<U+2009>Hz. Unexpectedly, the subjects were most satisfied with sounds having emphasis on low frequencies. A sound having a slope of -7<U+2009>dB per octave increment resulted in the highest satisfaction. Changes in subjective ratings were reasonably well predicted by five noise indices, while many well-known noise indices frequently used in building design underperformed in this task. The results are expected to benefit in the design of masking sounds and other appliances."
"25763196","The Impact of Different Permissible Exposure Limits on Hearing Threshold Levels Beyond 25 dBA.","BACKGROUND: Development of noise-induced hearing loss is reliant on a few factors such as frequency, intensity, and duration of noise exposure. The occurrence of this occupational malady has doubled from 120 million to 250 million in a decade. Countries such as Malaysia, India, and the US have adopted 90 dBA as the permissible exposure limit. According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the exposure limit for noise is 90 dBA, while that of the US National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is 85 dBA for 8 hours of noise exposure.OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the development of hearing threshold levels beyond 25 dBA on adoption of 85 dBA as the permissible exposure limit compared to 90 dBA.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is an intervention study done on two automobile factories. There were 203 employees exposed to noise levels beyond the action level. Hearing protection devices were distributed to reduce noise levels to a level between the permissible exposure limit and action level. The permissible exposure limits were 90 and 85 dBA in factories 1 and 2, respectively, while the action levels were 85 and 80 dBA, respectively. The hearing threshold levels of participants were measured at baseline and at first month of postshift exposure of noise. The outcome was measured by a manual audiometer. McNemar and chi-square tests were used in the statistical analysis.RESULTS: We found that hearing threshold levels of more than 25 dBA has changed significantly from pre-intervention to post-intervention among participants from both factories (3000 Hz for the right ear and 2000 Hz for the left ear). There was a statistically significant association between participants at 3000 Hz on the right ear at 'deteriorated' level ( <U+03C7>² (1) = 4.08, f = - 0.142, P = 0.043), whereas there was worsening of hearing threshold beyond 25 dBA among those embraced 90 dBA.CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of 85 dBA as the permissible exposure limit has preserved hearing threshold level among participants at 3000 Hz compared to those who embraced 90 dBA."
"25759070","Noise-induced hearing loss and combined noise and vibration exposure.","BACKGROUND: While there is a wide body of literature addressing noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS) independently, relatively few studies have considered the combined effects of noise and vibration. These studies have suggested an increased risk of NIHL in workers with vibration white finger (VWF), though the relationship remains poorly understood.AIMS: To determine whether hearing impairment is worse in noise-exposed workers with VWF than in workers with similar noise exposures but without VWF.METHODS: The Quebec National Institute of Public Health audiometric database was used in conjunction with work-related accident and occupational diseases data from the Quebec workers' compensation board to analyse differences in audiometry results between vibration-exposed workers in the mining and forestry industries and the overall source population, and between mining and forestry workers with documented VWF and those without VWF. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 7029 standards were used to calculate hearing loss not attributable to age.RESULTS: 15751 vibration-exposed workers were identified in an overall source population of 59339. Workers with VWF (n = 96) had significantly worse hearing at every frequency studied (500, 1000, 2000 4000 Hz) compared with other mining and forestry workers without VWF.CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms previous findings of greater hearing loss at higher frequencies in workers with VWF, but also found a significant difference in hearing loss at low frequencies. It therefore supports the association between combined noise and hand-arm vibration (HAV) exposure and NIHL."

Results of an epidemiological study on hearing status (HÖRSTAT)].","BACKGROUND: A pure-tone average of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz in the better ear (PTA-4) is the international standard criterion set by the World Health Organization (WHO) to describe hearing loss. Presently, there are no epidemiological data on hearing loss in Germany based on this criterion.METHODS: A representative sample of adults from Oldenburg and Emden were invited for a hearing assessment. This article analyzes the association between hearing loss and age, sex, noise, occupation, and educational level. Age- and sex-specific prevalence rates following the WHO classification are compared with international findings.RESULTS: According to the WHO classification, the prevalence of hearing impairment in the study cohort (n=1,866) is approx. 16%. In men, who more commonly work in noisy jobs, a higher prevalence rate is observed than in women of the same age. Nevertheless, sex differences in the present study are smaller than those reported in most international studies. PTA-4 is approximately the same for men and women when effects of occupational noise are controlled, but differences in prevalence between occupational areas are still significant.CONCLUSION: Compared with international findings, age-specific prevalence rates in HÖRSTAT are low. In the synopsis of epidemiological studies of the past 25 years, a trend toward decreasing prevalence in middle and higher age groups can be observed."
"25705651","Audiogram comparison of workers from five professional categories.","INTRODUCTION: Noise is a major cause of health disorders in workers and has unique importance in the auditory analysis of people exposed to it. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the arithmetic mean of the auditory thresholds at frequencies of 3, 4, and 6 kHz of workers from five professional categories exposed to occupational noise.METHODS: We propose a retrospective cross-sectional cohort study to analyze 2.140 audiograms from seven companies having five sectors of activity: one footwear company, one beverage company, two ceramics companies, two metallurgical companies, and two transport companies.RESULTS: When we compared two categories, we noticed a significant difference only for cargo carriers in comparison to the remaining categories. In all activity sectors, the left ear presented the worst values, except for the footwear professionals (P &gt; 0.05). We observed an association between the noise exposure time and the reduction of audiometric values for both ears. Significant differences existed for cargo carriers in relation to other groups. This evidence may be attributed to different forms of exposure. A slow and progressive deterioration appeared as the exposure time increased."
"25665831","The role of genetic factors for hearing deterioration across 20 years: a twin study.","BACKGROUND: Hearing deterioration at advanced ages is associated with environmental exposures (eg, to noise and solvents) and genetic influences may also be important. Little is known about the role of genetic influences on hearing when evaluated longitudinally. We sought to investigate longitudinal hearing loss in a cohort of adult male twins to evaluate the importance of genetic and environmental factors for hearing deterioration over time.METHODS: Hearing using conventional clinical audiometry was assessed in 583 male twins (128 monozygotic twin pairs and 111 dizygotic twin pairs) aged 34-79 at baseline and again two decades later. The hearing thresholds at two time points were compared at each frequency and in two different frequency regions. Genetic analyses were based on structural equation models. Bivariate Cholesky decomposition was used for longitudinal analysis.RESULTS: The prevalence of hearing loss increased over time in better and worse ear. The hearing threshold shift was more pronounced in the high-frequency region, especially at 8000 Hz. Genetic influences were moderate (heritability: 53%-65%) for pure-tone averages at both lower and higher frequencies, and were of equal magnitude at baseline and follow-up. In contrast, environmental influences were of substantial importance (55%-88%) for rate of change of the hearing threshold over the 18-year period.CONCLUSIONS: Genetic factors are of considerable importance for level of hearing acuity, but environmental factors are more important for rate of change over an 18-year period."
"25620313","Efficacy and safety of N-acetylcysteine in prevention of noise induced hearing loss: a randomized clinical trial.","Despite a robust hearing conservation program, military personnel continue to be at high risk for noise induced hearing loss (NIHL). For more than a decade, a number of laboratories have investigated the use of antioxidants as a safe and effective adjunct to hearing conservation programs. Of the antioxidants that have been investigated, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has consistently reduced permanent NIHL in the laboratory, but its clinical efficacy is still controversial. This study provides a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating the safety profile and the efficacy of NAC to prevent hearing loss in a military population after weapons training. Of the 566 total study subjects, 277 received NAC while 289 were given placebo. The null hypothesis for the rate of STS was not rejected based on the measured results. While no significant differences were found for the primary outcome, rate of threshold shifts, the right ear threshold shift rate difference did approach significance (p = 0.0562). No significant difference was found in the second primary outcome, percentage of subjects experiencing an adverse event between placebo and NAC groups (26.7% and 27.4%, respectively, p = 0.4465). Results for the secondary outcome, STS rate in the trigger hand ear, did show a significant difference (34.98% for placebo-treated, 27.14% for NAC-treated, p-value = 0.0288). Additionally, post-hoc analysis showed significant differences in threshold shift rates when handedness was taken into account. While the secondary outcomes and post-hoc analysis suggest that NAC treatment is superior to the placebo, the present study design failed to confirm this. The lack of significant differences in overall hearing loss between the treatment and placebo groups may be due to a number of factors, including suboptimal dosing, premature post-exposure audiograms, or differences in risk between ears or subjects. Based on secondary outcomes and post hoc analyses however, further studies seem warranted and are needed to clarify dose response and the factors that may have played a role in the observed results.

The authors' goal in the study described here was to assess noise from electric generators and impacts in the commercial areas of Agbowo and Ajibode in Ibadan, Nigeria. Noise levels (A-weighted decibels [dBA]) were measured over 12 weeks, three times a day, during the 2010 dry season using a sound level meter. A questionnaire was administered (515 respondents; 304 in Agbowo, 211 in Ajibode) and audiometric measurements were conducted on 40% of respondents. Mean noise levels varied by source (104 ± 7.7 dBA [diesel], 94.0 ± 6.3 dBA [petrol]) and were highest midday (90.6 ± 5.3 dBA [Agbowo], 70.9 ± 6.2 dBA [Ajibode]). Mean noise levels in Agbowo (78.5 ± 3.9 dBA) and Ajibode (65.7 ± 4.4 dBA) exceeded World Health Organization guidelines (65 dBA) for outdoor commercial environments. Working and living in Agbowo was significantly associated with current evidence of hearing impairment (odds ratio: 6.8, 95% confidence interval: 3.4-13.7). Reducing exposure to noise from electric power generators serving urban small businesses and homes is warranted."

"27991470","Air traffic controllers' long-term speech-in-noise training effects: A control group study.","INTRODUCTION: Speech perception in noise relies on the capacity of the auditory system to process complex sounds using sensory and cognitive skills. The possibility that these can be trained during adulthood is of special interest in auditory disorders, where speech in noise perception becomes compromised. Air traffic controllers (ATC) are constantly exposed to radio communication, a situation that seems to produce auditory learning. The objective of this study has been to quantify this effect.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 19 ATC and 19 normal hearing individuals underwent a speech in noise test with three signal to noise ratios: 5, 0 and -5 dB. Noise and speech were presented through two different loudspeakers in azimuth position. Speech tokes were presented at 65 dB SPL, while white noise files were at 60, 65 and 70 dB respectively.RESULTS: Air traffic controllers outperform the control group in all conditions [P&lt;0.05 in ANOVA and Mann-Whitney U tests]. Group differences were largest in the most difficult condition, SNR=-5 dB. However, no correlation between experience and performance were found for any of the conditions tested. The reason might be that ceiling performance is achieved much faster than the minimum experience time recorded, 5 years, although intrinsic cognitive abilities cannot be disregarded.DISCUSSION: ATC demonstrated enhanced ability to hear speech in challenging listening environments. This study provides evidence that long-term auditory training is indeed useful in achieving better speech-in-noise understanding even in adverse conditions, although good cognitive qualities are likely to be a basic requirement for this training to be effective.CONCLUSION: Our results show that ATC outperform the control group in all conditions. Thus, this study provides evidence that long-term auditory training is indeed useful in achieving better speech-in-noise understanding even in adverse conditions."
"27991469","Gender differences in use of hearing protection devices among farm operators.","PURPOSE: Although farm operators have frequent exposure to hazardous noise and high rates of noise-induced hearing loss, they have low use of hearing protection devices (HPDs). Women represent about one-third of farm operators, and their numbers are climbing. However, among published studies examining use of HPDs in this worker group, none have examined gender-related differences. The purpose of this study was to examine gender-related differences in use of hearing protection and related predictors among farm operators.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data previously collected at farm shows and by telephone were analyzed using t-tests and generalized linear model with zero inflated negative binomial (ZINB) distribution.FINDINGS: The difference in rate of hearing protector use between men and women farm operators was not significant. There was no difference between men and women in most hearing protector-related attitudes and beliefs.CONCLUSION: Although men and women farm operators had similar rates of use of hearing protectors when working in high-noise environments, attitudes about HPD use differed. Specifically, interpersonal role modeling was a predictor of HPD use among women, but not for men. This difference suggests that while farm operators of both genders may benefit from interventions designed to reduce barriers to HPD use (e.g., difficulty communicating with co-workers and hearing warning sounds), farm women have unique needs in relation to cognitive-perceptual factors that predict HPD use. Women farm operators may lack role models for use of HPDs (e.g., in peers and advertising), contributing to their less frequent use of protection."
"27991463","Parametric method for the noise risk assessment of professional orchestral musicians.","BACKGROUND: The Occupational Health and Safety (OH&amp;S) literature shows that noise could represent a risk factor for professional orchestral musicians. The continuative exposition to elevated noise levels and the particular nature of the activity make necessary an &quot;atypical&quot; OH&amp;S approach, which was identified to be necessarily organizational.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, a parametric-based method for orchestral exposure assessment and management was developed. The goal was to achieve a predictive tool to involve safety in the decision making of concert season program. After setting the parameters, the project's hypothesis was defined and then validated through a yearly-scale monitoring on an important European symphonic orchestra. Moreover, workers' exposure was assessed from the parametric study by a wide measurement campaign.RESULTS: A general validation of the method was obtained by the verification of the main parameters' (repertoire, headcount, and disposition) significant influence on the sound pressure levels produced by the orchestra. Exposure levels comparable to the trends in literature for symphonic orchestras were observed, with criticalities among brass musicians, which was the only group exceeding the upper exposure action values.CONCLUSION: This research has emphasized that the exposure condition of musicians can be critical and requires the implementation of improvement plans. The study has shown that the predictive analysis can be performed on parameters describing the concert's emissive characteristics. The future development of research currently under study will focus on the concert's pieces and the use of parameters as indicators of the exposure context."
"27991461","The viability of hearing protection device fit-testing at navy and marine corps accession points.","INTRODUCTION: The viability of hearing protection device (HPD) verification (i.e., fit-testing) on a large scale was investigated to address this gap in a military accession environment.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Personal Attenuation Ratings (PARs) following self-fitted (SELF-Fit) HPDs were acquired from 320 US Marine Corps training recruits (87.5% male, 12.5% female) across four test protocols (1-, 3-, 5-, and 7- frequency). SELF-Fit failures received follow-up to assess potential causes. Follow-up PARs were acquired (Experimenter fit [EXP-Fit], followed by Subject re-fit [SUB Re-Fit]). EXP-Fit was intended to provide a perception (dubbed &quot;ear canal muscle memory&quot;) of what a correctly fitted HPD should feel like. SUB Re-Fit was completed following EXP-Fit to determine whether a training recruit could duplicate EXP-Fit on her/his own without assistance.RESULTS: A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>320) showed that SELF-Fit means differed significantly between protocols (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). Post-hoc analyses showed that the 1-freq SELF-Fit mean was significantly lower than all other protocols (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.03) by 5.6 dB or more. No difference was found between the multi-frequency protocols. For recruits who were followed up with EXP-Fit (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>79), across all protocols, a significant (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) mean improvement of 25.68 dB (10.99) was found, but PARs did not differ (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.99) between EXP-Fit protocols. For recruits in the 3-freq and 5-freq protocol groups who experienced all three PAR test methods (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>33), PAR methods differed (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) but no method by protocol interaction was found (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.46). Post hoc tests showed that both EXP-Fit and SUB Re-Fit had significantly better attenuation than SELF-Fit (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001), but no difference was found between EXPFit and SUB Re-Fit (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.59). For SELF-Fit, the 1-freq protocol resulted in a 35% pass rate, whereas the 3-, 5-, and 7-freq protocols resulted in &gt;60% pass rates. Results showed that once recruits experienced how HPDs should feel when inserted correctly, they were able to properly replicate the procedure with similar results to the expert fit suggesting &quot;ear canal muscle memory&quot; may be a viable training strategy concomitant with HPD verification. Fit-test duration was also measured to examine the tradeoff between results accuracy and time required to complete each protocol.DISCUSSION: Results from this study showed the critical importance of initial selection and fitting of HPDs followed by verification (i.e., fit-testing) at Navy and Marine Corps accession points. Achieving adequate protection from an HPD is fundamentally dependent on obtaining proper fit of the issued HPD as well as the quality of training recruits receive regarding HPD use."

Subjects were then categorized into four levels of exposure: &lt;80, 80-85, &gt;85 to &lt;90, and =90 A-weighted Decibel [dB(A)]. DPOAE signals were collected by trained audiological staff, applying a standard optimized protocol, at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of the University Hospital Regensburg.STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Mean DPOAE signals were compared between levels by unpaired t test. Novel linear regression models adjusting for other leisure noise exposures and with outcome variables DPoutcome and 4 kilo Hertz (kHz) DPOAEs estimated effects between levels.RESULTS: A total of 1468 subjects (56% female, mostly aged 15 or 16 years) were available for analysis. Comparison of DPOAE means by PMP exposure typically showed no greater than 1<U+2009>dB difference between groups. In fact, comparisons between =90 dB(A) and &lt;80 dB(A) presented the least differences in magnitude. Both DPoutcome and 4<U+2009>kHz linear regression models presented a weak association with the 4-level PMP exposure variable. An expected dose-response to PMP exposure was not observed in any analyses.CONCLUSIONS: DPOAE signal strength alone cannot indicate preclinical NIHL in adolescents."
"27989949","The effect of sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus on speech recognition over air and bone conduction military communications headsets.","Military personnel are at risk for hearing loss due to noise exposure during deployment (USACHPPM, 2008). Despite mandated use of hearing protection, hearing loss and tinnitus are prevalent due to reluctance to use hearing protection. Bone conduction headsets can offer good speech intelligibility for normal hearing (NH) listeners while allowing the ears to remain open in quiet environments and the use of hearing protection when needed. Those who suffer from tinnitus, the experience of perceiving a sound not produced by an external source, often show degraded speech recognition; however, it is unclear whether this is a result of decreased hearing sensitivity or increased distractibility (Moon et al., 2015). It has been suggested that the vibratory stimulation of a bone conduction headset might ameliorate the effects of tinnitus on speech perception; however, there is currently no research to support or refute this claim (Hoare et al., 2014). Speech recognition of words presented over air conduction and bone conduction headsets was measured for three groups of listeners: NH, sensorineural hearing impaired, and/or tinnitus sufferers. Three levels of speech-to-noise (SNR = 0, -6, -12 dB) were created by embedding speech items in pink noise. Better speech recognition performance was observed with the bone conduction headset regardless of hearing profile, and speech intelligibility was a function of SNR. Discussion will include study limitations and the implications of these findings for those serving in the military."

"27957560","Auditory and Nonauditory Effects of Ultrasonic Scaler Use and Its Role in the Development of Permanent Hearing Loss.","PURPOSE: To evaluate the negative auditory and non-auditory effects developed immediately after using ultrasonic scalers and their potential role in the development of permanent hearing loss.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The auditory functions of 60 dental clinicians were evaluated with the pure tone audiometry test (PTA), tympanogram and the otoacoustic emission test (OAE) before and immediately after using ultrasonic scalers. The paired t-test was used to evaluate the difference in the pre- and post-exposure recordings for all three tests.RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the PTA and tympanogram test results, along with reduced OAE values immediately after using ultrasonic scalers. Hearing ability dropped by 63% to 66% immediately after using ultrasonic scalers. The maximum hearing disability was noted for low-frequency thresholds. The reduction was greater in the left than in the right ear.CONCLUSIONS: Noise-emitting devices such as ultrasonic scalers produce significant immediate auditory and non-auditory changes. It is important that dentists recognise the initial signs of hearing damage and adopt appropriate measures while working to prevent the development of permanent hearing impairment in future."

Little is known about hearing loss and how it progresses in Veterans following military service. This epidemiology study is designed to evaluate and monitor a cohort of Veterans for 20 years or more to determine how hearing loss changes over time and how those changes are related to noise exposure and other ototoxic exposures encountered during military service. Data reported here are from baseline assessments of the first 100 study participants (84 males; 16 females; mean age 33.5 years; SD 8.8; range 21-58). Each participant was asked to complete a comprehensive audiologic examination and self-report questionnaires regarding sociodemographic characteristics, noise and solvent exposures, health conditions common among post-deployment Veterans, and the social and emotional consequences of hearing loss. For this relatively young cohort, 29% exhibited hearing loss, defined as average hearing threshold &gt;20 dB HL in the conventional audiometric range. Forty-two percent exhibited hearing loss in the extended-high-frequency audiometric range using the same criterion (average hearing threshold &gt;20 dB HL). Certain factors were found to be associated with poorer hearing in both conventional and extended-high-frequency ranges, including age, type of military branch, years of military service, number of military deployments, noise exposure, tinnitus, and a positive screen for post-traumatic stress disorder. Although the majority of participants had hearing within normal limits, 27% reported a self-perceived mild/moderate hearing handicap and 14% reported a significant handicap. Further research is needed to identify a cause for this discrepancy in audiologic results versus self-report. The information obtained from this longitudinal study could be used in future resource planning with the goal of preventing, as much as possible, the development of hearing loss during military service, and the exacerbation of prevalent hearing loss after military service and over Veterans' lifetimes."

"27876480","Noise dosimetry for tactical environments.","Noise exposure and the subsequent hearing loss are well documented aspects of military life. Numerous studies have indicated high rates of noise-induced hearing injury (NIHI) in active-duty service men and women, and recent statistics from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs indicate a population of veterans with hearing loss that is growing at an increasing rate. In an effort to minimize hearing loss, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) updated its Hearing Conservation Program in 2010, and also has recently revised the DoD Design Criteria Standard Noise Limits (MIL-STD-1474E) which defines allowable noise levels in the design of all military acquisitions including weapons and vehicles. Even with such mandates, it remains a challenge to accurately quantify the noise exposure experienced by a Warfighter over the course of a mission or training exercise, or even in a standard work day. Noise dosimeters are intended for exactly this purpose, but variations in device placement (e.g., free-field, on-body, in/near-ear), hardware (e.g., microphone, analog-to-digital converter), measurement time (e.g., work day, 24-h), and dose metric calculations (e.g., time-weighted energy, peak levels, Auditory Risk Units), as well as noise types (e.g., continuous, intermittent, impulsive) can cause exposure measurements to be incomplete, inaccurate, or inappropriate for a given situation. This paper describes the design of a noise dosimeter capable of acquiring exposure data across tactical environments. Two generations of prototypes have been built at MIT Lincoln Laboratory with funding from the U.S. Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. Details related to hardware, signal processing, and testing efforts are provided, along with example tactical military noise data and lessons learned from early fieldings. Finally, we discuss the continued need to prioritize personalized dosimetry in order to improve models that predict or characterize the risk of auditory damage, to integrate dosimeters with hearing-protection devices, and to inform strategies and metrics for reducing NIHI."

Based on the prevalence rates, 2 different spreadsheet models were constructed in order to compare the prevalence rates of various groups of workers with the expected rates. The spreadsheets were then tested on 10 different occupational groups with varying degrees of hearing loss as compared to a reference population.RESULTS: Hearing of office workers, train drivers, conductors and teachers differed little from the screened reference values based on the Norwegian and the NIOSH criterion. The construction workers, miners, farmers and military had an impaired hearing and railway maintenance workers and bus drivers had a mildly impaired hearing. The spreadsheet models give a valid assessment of the hearing loss.CONCLUSIONS: The use of spreadsheet models to compare hearing in occupational groups with that of a reference population is a simple and quick method. The results are in line with comparable hearing thresholds, and allow for significance testing.

Cases of use and no use of earmuffs (in the passive mode and level-dependent ones) were all taken into consideration.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The auditory danger signal and ambient noise were recorded in an industrial hall. Signals were reproduced at an experimental set-up, using a large number of speakers. Eight speakers for reproduction of the auditory danger signal were placed above a subject's head. The study participants would indicate the direction from which, according to them, the auditory danger signal was being emitted.RESULTS: The average percentage rate of the correct localization amounted to 75.8% when the overhead crane's signal wasn't masked. The presence of ambient noise caused a reduction of the number of correctly identified localization to 66.6%. The use of earmuffs in the passive mode resulted in the worst results (44.5%). There is some improvement when level-dependent earmuffs are used (57.3%).CONCLUSIONS: In situations where it is important to identify the direction from which the auditory danger signal generated by the crane's signaling device is approaching, it is beneficial to use level-dependent earmuffs rather than earmuffs in the passive mode. Correct identification of whether the auditory danger signal generated by the crane's signaling device is approaching from the left or right side is almost perfect, however correct identification of whether the signal is approaching from the front or back of a person is not always possible.

Researchers suggested that individual HP fit tests be conducted to estimate the noise attenuation.OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether individual fit tests accurately predicted workers' ear plug noise protection while working and whether the real-time noise reduction (NR) remained constant in mining work while an ear plug was worn.METHODS: A total of 11 subjects from 3 coal mines each was fit tested using the microphone-in-real-ear (MIRE) technique on their E-A-Rtrademark earplugs in a typical mine office. The same fit tested miners each wore the same type of earplugs in his usual manner doing his normal work. The minute-by-minute real-time NRwork values were determined continuously during full shifts of work.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Results showed there was a modest prediction relationship (R2<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.53) between NRfit and NRwork. NRwork values of each miner's earplug fluctuated over 20 dBA while the earplug was worn. However, each was still able to achieve an average NRwork of more than 10 dBA, indicating the earplug was somewhat effective in reducing noise, if worn. Refitting was an important cause of the low NRwork values. Low-frequency noise sources might be also important causes."

Hearing readiness and conservation practices differ among the four largest uniformed military services (Air Force, Army, Marine Corps, and Navy). Utilizing a data set consisting of all hearing loss claims submitted to the VA from fiscal years 2003-2013, we examined characteristics of veterans submitting claims within one year of separation from military service. Our results indicate that having a hearing loss disability claim granted was significantly more likely for men, individuals over the age of 26 years at the time of the claim, individuals most recently serving in the U.S. Army, and those with at least one hearing loss diagnosis. Importantly, individuals with at least one test record in the Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System-Hearing Conservation (DOEHRS-HC) system were significantly less likely to have a hearing loss disability claim granted by the VA. Within the DOEHRS-HC cohort, those with at least one threshold shift or clinical hearing loss diagnosis while on active duty were more than two and three times more likely to have a hearing loss disability claim granted, respectively. These findings indicate that an established history of reduced hearing ability while on active duty was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of an approved hearing loss disability claim relative to VA claims without such a history. Further, our results show a persistent decreased rate of hearing loss disability awards overall. These findings support increased inclusion of personnel in DoD hearing readiness and conservation programs to reduce VA hearing loss disability awards."

Experienced U.S. Navy personnel served as the study participants and were required to monitor information from multiple sources and respond appropriately to communications initiated by investigators playing the roles of other personnel involved in a realistic Naval scenario. In each block of the scenario, an adaptive intelligibility modification system employing automatic gain control was used to adjust the signal-to-noise ratio to achieve one of four speech intelligibility levels on a Modified Rhyme Test: No Loss, 80%, 60%, or 40%. Objective and subjective measures of operational performance suggested that performance systematically degraded with decreasing speech intelligibility, with the largest drop occurring between 80% and 60%. These results confirm the importance of noise reduction, good communication design, and effective hearing conservation programs to maximize the operational effectiveness of military personnel."

The next section categorizes types of noise (also called maskers) according to their temporal characteristics (steady or fluctuating) and perceptive effects (energetic or informational masking). Next, speech recognition difficulties experienced by listeners with hearing loss and by older listeners are summarized, and questions on the possible causes of speech-in-noise difficulty are discussed, including recent suggestions of &quot;hidden hearing loss&quot;.

"27768004","Office noise: Can headphones and masking sound attenuate distraction by background speech?","BACKGROUND: Background speech is one of the most disturbing noise sources at shared workplaces in terms of both annoyance and performance-related disruption. Therefore, it is important to identify techniques that can efficiently protect performance against distraction. It is also important that the techniques are perceived as satisfactory and are subjectively evaluated as effective in their capacity to reduce distraction.OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to compare three methods of attenuating distraction from background speech: masking a background voice with nature sound through headphones, masking a background voice with other voices through headphones and merely wearing headphones (without masking) as a way to attenuate the background sound. Quiet was deployed as a baseline condition.METHODS: Thirty students participated in an experiment employing a repeated measures design.RESULTS: Performance (serial short-term memory) was impaired by background speech (1 voice), but this impairment was attenuated when the speech was masked - and in particular when it was masked by nature sound. Furthermore, perceived workload was lowest in the quiet condition and significantly higher in all other sound conditions. Notably, the headphones tested as a sound-attenuating device (i.e. without masking) did not protect against the effects of background speech on performance and subjective work load.CONCLUSIONS: Nature sound was the only masking condition that worked as a protector of performance, at least in the context of the serial recall task. However, despite the attenuation of distraction by nature sound, perceived workload was still high - suggesting that it is difficult to find a masker that is both effective and perceived as satisfactory."

"27613755","Genetic variation in EYA4 on the risk of noise-induced hearing loss in Chinese steelworks firm sample.","OBJECTIVES: Noise-induced hearing loss is one of the most serious occupational diseases worldwide. It is caused by interactions between environmental and genetic factors. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between the genetic susceptibility of the eye absent homolog 4 (EYA4) gene and the risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss in China.METHODS: A case-control association study was carried out with 326 hearing loss cases and 326 controls matched with age and duration of noise exposure, drawn from a cohort of steel workers. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the EYA4 were selected and genotyped. Logistic regression was performed to analyse the main effect of genotypes and interactions between genotypes and individual/environmental factors adjusted for confounding factors. Moreover, generalised multiple dimensionality reduction was applied to further detect interaction among the 5 selected SNPs.RESULTS: Analysis revealed that locus polymorphism of rs3813346 was associated with the risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss in the dominance model, the codominance model and the addictive model (p=0.004, 0.009 and 0.003, respectively). A significant interaction between rs9321402 and cumulative noise exposure was found (p=0.002). A significant main effect p value (p=0.006) was obtained in the high-level exposure group (cumulative noise exposure =98 dB(A)). Generalised multiple dimensionality reduction indicated that the combined interaction of the 2 loci-rs3813346 and rs9493627-significantly affected the incidence of noise-induced hearing loss.CONCLUSIONS: The research suggests that EYA4 genetic variant and its interaction with noise levels may modify the susceptibility to develop noise-induced hearing loss in Chinese population."

"27540829","A faceoff with hazardous noise: Noise exposure and hearing threshold shifts of indoor hockey officials.","Noise exposure and hearing thresholds of indoor hockey officials of the Western States Hockey League were measured to assess the impact of hockey game noise on hearing sensitivity. Twenty-nine hockey officials who officiated the league in an arena in southeastern Wyoming in October, November, and December 2014 participated in the study. Personal noise dosimetry was conducted to determine if officials were exposed to an equivalent sound pressure level greater than 85 dBA. Hearing thresholds were measured before and after hockey games to determine if a 10 dB or greater temporary threshold shift in hearing occurred. Pure-tone audiometry was conducted in both ears at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz. All noise exposures were greater than 85 dBA, with a mean personal noise exposure level of 93 dBA (SD = 2.2), providing 17.7% (SD = 6.3) of the officials' daily noise dose according to the OSHA criteria. Hearing threshold shifts of 10 dB or greater were observed in 86.2% (25/29) of officials, with 36% (9/25) of those threshold shifts equaling 15 dB or greater. The largest proportion of hearing threshold shifts occurred at 4000 Hz, comprising 35.7% of right ear shifts and 31.8% of left ear shifts. The threshold shifts between the pre- and post-game audiometry were statistically significant in the left ear at 500 (p=.019), 2000 (p=.0009), 3000 (p&lt;.0001) and 4000 Hz (p=.0002), and in the right ear at 2000 (p=.0001), 3000 (p=.0001) and 4000 Hz (p&lt;.0001), based on Wilcoxon-ranked sum analysis. Although not statistically significant at alpha = 0.05, logistic regression indicated that with each increase of one dB of equivalent sound pressure measured from personal noise dosimetry, the odds of a = 10 dB TTS were increased in the left ear at 500 (OR=1.33, 95% CI 0.73-2.45), 3000 (OR=1.02, 95% CI 0.68-1.51), 4000 (OR=1.26, 95% CI 0.93-1.71) and 8000 Hz (OR=1.22, 95% CI 0.76-1.94) and in the right ear at 6000 (OR=1.03, 95% CI 0.14-7.84) and 8000 Hz (OR=1.29, 95% CI 0.12-13.83). These findings suggest that indoor hockey officials are exposed to hazardous levels of noise, experience temporary hearing loss after officiating games, and a hearing conservation program is warranted. Further temporary threshold shift research has the potential to identify officials of other sporting events that are at an increased risk of noise-induced hearing loss."

Respondents consisted of 49 cases that were diagnosed from 2005 to 2008 with 98 controls from the same work places. Chi-square test and Mann-Whitney test were used in a univariate analysis to determine the association between hearing impairment and the contributing risks being studied.RESULTS: The results of the univariate analysis showed that hearing impairment was significantly (p&lt;0.05) associated with older age, lower education level, high smoking dose, high occupational daily noise dose, longer duration of service, infrequent used of hearing protection device (HPD), and low perception of sound on HPD usage. Multivariate logistic regression of hearing impairment after controlling for age found the following five variables: occupational daily noise dose =50% (OR 3.48, 95% CI 1.36-8.89), =15 years of services (OR 2.92, 95% CI 1.16-7.33), infrequent use of HPD (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.15-6.77), low perception of sound on HPD (POR 2.77, 95% CI 1.09-6.97), and smoking more than 20 packs per year (OR 4.71, 95% CI 1.13-19.68).DISCUSSION: In conclusion, high occupational noise exposure level, longer duration of service, low perception of sound on HPD, infrequent used of HPD, and smoking more than 20 packs per year were the contributing factors to hearing impairment, and appropriate intervention measures should be proposed and taken into considerations."

"27443751","Possibilities of spatial hearing testing in occupational medicine.","Dysfunctions of the organ of hearing are a significant limitation in the performance of occupations that require its full efficiency (vehicle driving, army, police, fire brigades, mining). Hearing impairment is associated with poorer understanding of speech and disturbed sound localization that directly affects the worker's orientation in space and his/her assessment of distance and location of other workers or, even most importantly, of dangerous machines. Testing sound location abilities is not a standard procedure, even in highly specialized audiological examining rooms. It should be pointed out that the ability to localize sounds which are particularly loud, is not directly associated with the condition of the hearing organ, but is rather considered an auditory function of a higher level. Disturbances in sound localization are mainly associated with structural and functional disturbances of the central nervous system and occur also in patients with normal hearing when tested with standard methods. The article presents different theories explaining the phenomenon of sound localization, such as interaural differences in time, interaural differences in sound intensity, monaural spectrum shape and the anatomical and physiological basis of these processes. It also describes methods of measurement of disturbances in sound localization which are used in Poland and around the world, also by the author of this work. The author analyzed accessible reports on sound localization testing in occupational medicine and the possibilities of using such tests in various occupations requiring full fitness of the organ of hearing.

The frequencies that compose the exam are generally between 9 KHz and 20KHz, depending on the equipment.OBJECTIVE: This study aims to perform a retrospective and secondary systematic revision of publications on high-frequency audiometry on hearing monitoring of individuals exposed to occupational noise.DATA SYNTHESIS: This systematic revision followed the methodology proposed in the Cochrane Handbook, focusing on the question: &quot;Is High-frequency Audiometry more sensitive than Conventional Audiometry in the screening of early hearing loss individuals exposed to occupational noise?&quot; The search was based on PubMed data, Base, Web of Science (Capes), Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde (BVS), and in the references cited in identified and selected articles. The search resulted in 6059 articles in total. Of these, only six studies were compatible with the criteria proposed in this study.CONCLUSION: The performed meta-analysis does not definitively answer the study's proposed question. It indicates that the 16 KHz high frequency audiometry (HFA) frequency is sensitive in early identification of hearing loss in the control group (medium difference (MD<U+2009>=<U+2009>8.33)), as well as the 4 KHz frequency (CA), this one being a little less expressive (MD<U+2009>=<U+2009>5.72). Thus, others studies are necessary to confirm the HFA importance for the early screening of hearing loss on individuals exposed to noise at the workplace."

"27364108","[Do hearing threshold levels in workers of the furniture industry reflect their exposure to noise?].","BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to analyze the hearing status of employees of a furniture factory with respect to their exposure to noise and the presence of additional risk factors of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).MATERIAL AND METHODS: Noise measurements, questionnaire survey and assessment of hearing, using pure tone audiometry, were carried out in 50 male workers, aged 20-57 years, directly employed in the manufacture of furniture. The actual workers' hearing threshold levels (HTLs) were compared with the predictions calculated according to PN-ISO 1999:2000 based on age, gender and noise exposure.RESULTS: Workers under study were exposed to noise at daily noise exposure levels of 82.7-94.8 dB (mean: 90.9 dB) for a period of 3-14 years. In all subjects, mean HTL at 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz did not exceed 25 dB. Nevertheless, high frequency notches were found in 11% of audiograms. The actual workers' HTLs at 3000-6000 Hz were similar to those predicted using PN-ISO 1999:2000. There were statistical significant differences between HTLs in subgroups of people with higher (&gt; 78 mm Hg) and lower (= 78 mm Hg) diastolic blood pressure, smokers and non-smokers, and those working with organic solvents. Hearing loss was more evident in subjects affected by the additional risk factors specified above.CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the need to consider, in addition to noise, also some other NIHL risk factors, such as tobacco smoking, elevated blood pressure, and co-exposure to organic solvents when estimating the risk of NIHL and developing the hearing conservation programs for workers.

"27340983","Hearing Loss in Persons Exposed and not Exposed to Occupational Noise.","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare hearing loss in individuals at risk and those not at risk for occupational noise and to compare working loss by gender.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis used data from a current Czech Ministry of Health grant project called Epidemiological and Genetic Study of the Frequency of Hearing Loss (2011 to 2015; NT12246-5/2011). The analyzed sample comprised 4988 participants. Hearing was tested using pure-tone threshold audiometry, tympanometry, and measurement of the stapedius reflex.RESULTS: Females at risk and those not at risk for occupational noise who were younger than 44 years and older than 75 years were found to have no statistically significant differences at any pure-tone threshold audiometry frequency. In females aged 45 to 74 years, statistically significant differences were found. In males, hearing loss was observed as early as 18 years of age. When comparing males and females at no risk for occupational noise, there were no statistically significant differences at any of the frequencies in those younger than 29 years. In females aged 30 years or older, statistically significant differences were observed at various frequencies in all age groups. When comparing males and females at risk for occupational noise, statistically significant differences were more frequent than in employees not exposed to noise.CONCLUSION: Hearing loss in females does not significantly vary depending on occupational exposure. The opposite is true for males. However, the maximum differences in mean levels did not exceed 10 dB. It is therefore clear that noise is a preventable factor, and the use of personal protective equipment is warranted."

The questionnaires were adopted to collect individual features and audiometry tests performed. In the sstudy, 286 subjects were diagnosed as cases, Which were each designated on the basis of the matched criterion, and 286 paired samples were selected finally. Noise intensity was measured according to the standards given in 'Measurement of Noise in the Workplace'(Occupational Health Standard of the People's Republic of China, GBZ/T189.8-2007). Cumulative noise exposure (CNE) was calculated, according to monitoring data on A-weighed sound pressure level and employment time. Genomic DNA was obtained from peripheral blood samples using 2 mL DNA extraction Kit following the manufacturer's protocol. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of GRHL2 were genotyped by multiplex SNP genotyping kit. The continuous variables and categorical variables were analyzed by t-test and chi-square test respectively. Multivariate Logistic regression was used to test the association between genetic frequency and disease status, with adjustments for the possible confounding variables. The haplotypes were established and their frequencies in the two groups were assessed by haploview and phase softwares.RESULTS: All the five SNPs (rs3735713, rs3824090, rs3735714, rs3735715 and rs611419) were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) (P&gt;0.05). The subjects carrying rs3735715 GG genotype had a higher NIHL risk than those carrying the GA genotype under the co-dominant model (OR=0.644, 95% CI: 0.442-0.939, P=0.022) after adjustment for height, blood pressure, drinking status and smoking status. After being stratified by CNE, in the CNE = 98 dB (A) group, rs3735715 polymorphism was associated with the NIHL under the co-dominant model (OR=0.509, 95% CI: 0.281-0.923, P=0.026) after adjustment for height, blood pressure, drinking status and smoking status as well. However, no statistical significant difference was found in variant genotypes of the other SNPs between the case and control subjects. Four-locus (rs3735713, rs3824090, rs3735714 and rs3735715) haplotypes were constructed, and no risk or protective haplotypes was identified.CONCLUSION: It is suggested that GRHL2 polymorphisms may be associated with development of NIHL."

In order to examine the effects of blast injury on hearing sensitivity, we developed a large database composed of demographic, audiometric, point of injury, and medical outcome data, with the primary aim of developing a long-standing and integrated capability for the surveillance, assessment, and investigation of blast-related hearing outcomes. Methods used to develop the dataset are described. Encompassing more than 16,500 Navy and Marine Corps personnel, the Blast-Related Auditory Injury Database (BRAID) includes individuals with a blast-related injury and nonblast control subjects. Using baseline and postdeployment hearing threshold data, a retrospective analysis of the cohort revealed that the rate of hearing loss for the injured servicemembers was 39%. The BRAID will be useful for studies that assess hearing patterns following deployment-related injury, such as blast exposures, that facilitate exploration of health outcomes and whether they are predictive of audiometric disposition and that help establish hearing loss prevention strategies and program policies for affected military commands and servicemembers.

The study analyzed existing data from two different populations (154 firefighters and 769 operating engineers) who completed a survey and audiometric tests as part of a hearing loss prevention intervention study. Approximately 40% of both groups reported tinnitus; 34% of firefighters and 59% of operating engineers showed hearing loss at noise-sensitive frequencies (4 kHz and 6 kHz). Firefighters with high frequency hearing loss (odds ratio [OR] = 2.31; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.05, 5.11]) and those with perceived impaired hearing status (OR = 3.53; 95% CI = [1.27, 9.80]) were significantly more likely to report tinnitus.

The hearing -in-noise abilities of the two groups were characterized under two signal conditions: 1) speech tokens and white noise sampled at 44.1 kHz (unfiltered condition) and 2) speech tokens plus white noise, each passed through a 4th order Butterworth filter with 70 and 8000 Hz low and high cutoffs (filtered condition). These tests were performed at signal-to-noise ratios of +5, 0, and -5-dB SNR.RESULTS: The ATCs outperformed the control group in all conditions. The differences were statistically significant in all cases, and the largest difference was observed under the most difficult conditions (-5 dB SNR). Overall, scores were higher when high-frequency components were not suppressed for both groups, although statistically significant differences were not observed for the control group at 0 dB SNR.CONCLUSION: The results indicate that ATCs are more capable of identifying speech in noise. This may be due to the effect of their training. On the other hand, performance seems to decrease when the high frequency components of speech are removed, regardless of training."

The hazardous effects of epoxy adhesives remain unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the risk of hearing loss among workers exposed to epoxy adhesives and noise.DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.METHODS: For this cross-sectional study, we recruited 182 stone workers who were exposed to both epoxy adhesives and noise, 89 stone workers who were exposed to noise only, and 43 workers from the administrative staff who had not been exposed to adhesives or noise. We obtained demographic data, occupational history and medical history through face-to-face interviews and arranged physical examinations and pure-tone audiometric tests. We also conducted walk-through surveys in the stone industry. A total of 40 representative noise assessments were conducted in 15 workplaces. Air sampling was conducted at 40 workplaces, and volatile organic compounds were analysed using the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) TO-15 method.RESULTS: The mean sound pressure level was 87.7 dBA (SD 9.9). The prevalence of noise-induced hearing loss was considerably increased in the stone workers exposed to epoxy adhesives (42%) compared with the stone workers who were not exposed to epoxy adhesives (21%) and the administrative staff group (9.3%). A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that exposure to epoxy adhesives significantly increased the risk of hearing loss between 2 and 6 kHz after adjusting for age. Significant interactions between epoxy adhesives and noise and hearing impairment were observed at 3, 4 and 6 kHz.CONCLUSIONS: Epoxy adhesives exacerbate hearing impairment in noisy environments, with the main impacts occurring in the middle and high frequencies."

For profiles simulating hearing loss, recognition scores were much more sensitive to the attenuation function. Substantial drops of 30% or more were found compared to unprotected listening in some conditions of steep attenuation slopes and large noise reductions. Attenuation functions modelled from real hearing protectors with nearly-flat attenuation yielded a benefit compared to unprotected listening for all hearing profiles studied. These findings were true in both noises.CONCLUSIONS: Limiting the slope of the hearing protector attenuation function and/or the overall amount of noise reduction is useful and warranted for workers with hearing loss to prevent adverse effects on speech recognition."

Participants receiving the interactive web-based information had comparable increased use of HPDs to those receiving the static web-based information. Participants receiving the mailed HPDs had more positive situational influences scale scores than other participants. Program satisfaction was highest among mailed and web-based information groups.CONCLUSIONS: A mailed assortment of hearing protectors was more effective than information. Interactive and static information delivered via web were similarly effective. Programs interested in increasing HPD use among farmers should consider making hearing protectors more available to farmers."

This study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence and severity of NIHL in bus and truck drivers of Mazandaran province in north Iran.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional descriptive study, 2283 drivers were examined clinically and para-clinically, including measuring their fasting blood sugar, triglyceride and cholesterol levels. All participants were evaluated for the air and bone thresholds of both ears. Twenty-three individuals were excluded from the study because of conductive hearing loss. Data from 2260 drivers were analyzed using SPSS version 18.RESULTS: Of the drivers, 37.5% had hearing loss in the right ear and 41.8% of the drivers had hearing loss in the left ear in one or more frequencies of sound. Hearing loss was significantly more frequent in the left ear and in 6000<U+2009>Hz followed by 4000<U+2009>Hz.CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the prevalence and severity of NIHL is high in drivers of Mazandaran province. There was a correlation between hearing loss and age and driving work history. We recommend considering hearing conservation programs more seriously."
"26756930","Changes in the mean hearing threshold levels in military aircraft maintenance conscripts.","Aircraft maintenance crews are constantly exposed to severe aircraft noise. The purpose of this study was to verify whether noise from aircraft adversely affects the hearing threshold levels (HTLs) of aircraft maintenance conscripts during their 2 years of mandatory military service. This study included 3,000 male aircraft maintenance conscripts who work in the military runway area. We measured and analyzed HTLs at 2-4 kHz. The duration of exposure to noise increased with an increase in rank; however, HTLs showed a tendency to decrease. We attributed such contradicting results to the learning effect and adaptation to military service. However, we suspected that sudden deafness in 6 conscripts (0.2%) was due to loud noise in the runway area during military service. The effectiveness of the hearing conservation program for short-term military service personnel could be increased by focusing on preventing sudden deafness and preenlistment baseline audiogram tests."
"26722345","Prevention of the Evolution of Workers' Hearing Loss from Noise-Induced Hearing Loss in Noisy Environments through a Hearing Conservation Program.","Introduction Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a serious problem for workers and therefore for businesses. The hearing conservation program (HCP) is a set of coordinated measures to prevent the development or evolution of occupational hearing loss, which involves a continuous and dynamic process of implementation of hearing conservation routines through anticipation, recognition, evaluation, and subsequent control of the occurrence of existing environmental risks or of those that may exist in the workplace and lead to workers' hearing damage. Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the HCP in preventing further hearing loss in workers with audiograms suggestive of NIHL. The audiometric tests and medical records of 28 furniture company workers exposed to noise were reviewed and monitored for 2 years. Methods This retrospective, cross-sectional study examined five audiometric tests in the medical records (on admission and every semester) of 28 workers in a furniture company (totaling 140 audiometric exams) following the introduction of the HCP. Results Data analysis showed no differences between the audiometric tests conducted on admission and those performed every semester. Conclusions The HCP implemented was effective in preventing the worsening of hearing loss in workers already with NIHL when exposed to occupational noise. Therefore, such a measure could be useful for the employment of workers with hearing loss in job sectors that have noise exposure. "
"26720128","Prevalence of permanent threshold shifts in the United States Air Force hearing conservation program by career field, 2005-2011.","The purpose of this study was to describe changes in hearing, using the permanent threshold shift metric, among United States Air Force servicemembers, including active duty, Reserve and Air National Guard components, for demographics, job categories, and career fields. In the United States Air Force, only servicemembers who are occupationally exposed routinely to hazardous noise are monitored. Audiogram records and demographic variables were analyzed for servicemembers from 2005-2011 using data from the Department of Defense system that captures occupational hearing tests worldwide. Results suggest that occupational hearing loss was larger in males than females, in officers than enlisted populations, and in Reserve and Air National Guard than in active duty. Compared to similar civilian career fields, active duty has lower prevalence rates for occupational hearing loss overall, although Reserve and Air National Guard prevalence rates were more similar to the civilian reported rates. The proportion of personnel with permanent threshold shifts varied between 4.6-16.7% within active duty career fields, which includes 76% of the population for study timeframe. Permanent threshold shift was larger in small job categories, and in jobs that are not considered exposed to hazardous noise routinely which is comparative with results from civilian data analysis of occupational hearing loss. Further investigation into testing practices for Air Force specific groups, use of the system for nonoccupational hearing testing, and challenges to follow-up compliance is warranted. Increased surveillance procedures for occupational hearing loss are needed to address concerns on the prevalence of servicemember hearing loss, the role of recreational and lifestyle factors to contribute the high reported hearing loss prevalence of veterans compared to nonveterans.

All participants were asked a number of questions regarding their health, communication, and attention, and underwent the Speech-in-Noise Test (SIN) to assess their closure skills and the Synthetic Sentence Identification Test - Ipsilateral Competitive Message (SSI-ICM) in monotic listening to evaluate their figure-ground abilities. Data were compared using nonparametric statistical tests and logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: More individuals in the SG reported fatigue and/or burnout and work-related stress and showed better performance than that of individuals in the CG for the figure-ground ability. Both groups performed similarly and satisfactorily in the other hearing tests. The odds ratio for participants belonging in the SG was 5.59 and 1.24 times regarding work-related stress and SSI-ICM (right ear), respectively.CONCLUSION: Results for the variables auditory closure, self-reported health, attention, and communication were similar in both groups. The SG presented significantly better performance in auditory figure-ground compared with that of the CG. Self-reported stress and right-ear SSI-ICM were significant predictors of individuals belonging to the SG.OBJETIVO: Investigar o perfil das habilidades auditivas de fechamento e figura-fundo e fatores relacionados à atenção, comunicação e saúde de controladores de tráfego aéreo (CTA) de aproximação de aeronaves e comparar com os de outros profissionais civis e militares.MÉTODO: Participaram 60 adultos com limiares audiométricos normais reunidos em dois grupos, pareados por idade e gênero: o grupo estudo formado por 30 profissionais do Controle de Aproximação de aeronaves e o controle, por 30 outros servidores civis e militares. Todos foram submetidos a perguntas relacionadas à atenção, comunicação e saúde e ao Teste de Fala com Ruído e de Identificação de Sentenças Sintéticas em escuta monótica (SSI) para avaliar fechamento e figura-fundo, respectivamente. Foram usados testes estatísticos não paramétricos e análise de regressão logística.RESULTADOS: O CTA autorreferiu maior cansaço/esgotamento e estresse e obteve melhor desempenho do que o grupo controle em figura-fundo e semelhante em fechamento. Foi observado que ocorreu uma probabilidade de ser CTA para o estresse em 5,59 vezes e para identificação de sentenças em escuta monótica à orelha direita de 1,24.CONCLUSÃO: Fechamento e autorrelato de dificuldades de saúde, comunicação e atenção na maioria das questões foram similares em ambos os grupos. Figura-fundo foi significativamente melhor em CTA. Autorreferência de estresse e desempenho à orelha direita no SSI foram preditores significantes do indivíduo ser do CTA."
"29192620","Noise-Induced Hearing Loss - A Preventable Disease? Results of a 10-Year Longitudinal Study of Workers Exposed to Occupational Noise.","AIMS: To survey current, Danish industrial noise levels and the use of hearing protection devices (HPD) over a 10-year period and to characterise the association between occupational noise and hearing threshold shift in the same period. Furthermore, the risk of hearing loss among the baseline and the follow-up populations according to first year of occupational noise exposure is evaluated.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2001-2003, we conducted a baseline survey of noise- and hearing-related disorders in 11 industries with suspected high noise levels. In 2009-2010, we were able to follow up on 271 out of the 554 baseline workers (49%). Mean noise levels per industry and self-reported HPD use are described at baseline and follow-up. The association between cumulative occupational noise exposure and hearing threshold shift over the 10-year period was assessed using linear regression, and the risk of hearing loss according to year of first occupational noise exposure was evaluated with logistic regression.RESULTS: Over the 10-year period, mean noise levels declined from 83.9 dB(A) to 82.8 dB(A), and for workers exposed &gt;85 dB(A), the use of HPD increased from 70.1 to 76.1%. We found a weak, statistically insignificant, inverse association between higher ambient cumulative noise exposure and poorer hearing (-0.10<U+2009>dB hearing threshold shift per dB-year (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.36; 0.16)). The risk of hearing loss seemed to increase with earlier first year of noise exposure, but odds ratios were only statistically significant among baseline participants with first exposure before the 1980s (odds ratio: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.11; 3.22).CONCLUSIONS: We observed declining industrial noise levels, increased use of HPD and no significant impact on hearing thresholds from current ambient industrial noise levels, which indicated a successful implementation of Danish hearing conservation programs."

"28925978","Dental Environmental Noise Evaluation and Health Risk Model Construction to Dental Professionals.","Occupational noise is unavoidably produced from dental equipment, building facilities, and human voices in the dental environment. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of occupational noise exposure on the dental professionals' health condition. The psychoacoustics approach noise exposure assessment followed by the health risk assessment was carried on at the paediatric dentistry clinic and the dental laboratory in the Prince Philip Dental Hospital of Hong Kong. The A-weighted equivalent sound level, total loudness, and sharpness values were statistically significantly higher for the noise at the laboratory than that at the clinic. The degree of perceived influences and sharpness of noise were found to have the impacts on the dental professionals' working performance and health. Moreover, the risk of having a bad hearing state would a have 26% and 31% higher chance for a unit increment of the short-term and long-term impact scores, respectively. The dental professionals with the service length more than 10 years and the daily working hours of more than eight showed the highest risk to their hearing state. The worse the hearing state was, the worse the health state was found for the dental professionals. Also, the risk of dissatisfaction would be increased by 4.41 and 1.22 times for those who worked at the laboratory and a unit increment of the long-term impact score. The constructed health risk mode with the scientific and statistical evidence is hence important for the future noise management of environmental improvement."

We categorised interventions as engineering controls, administrative controls, personal hearing protection devices, and hearing surveillance.We included 29 studies. One study evaluated legislation to reduce noise exposure in a 12-year time-series analysis but there were no controlled studies on engineering controls for noise exposure. Eleven studies with 3725 participants evaluated effects of personal hearing protection devices and 17 studies with 84,028 participants evaluated effects of hearing loss prevention programmes (HLPPs). Effects on noise exposure Engineering interventions following legislationOne ITS study found that new legislation in the mining industry reduced the median personal noise exposure dose in underground coal mining by 27.7 percentage points (95% confidence interval (CI) -36.1 to -19.3 percentage points) immediately after the implementation of stricter legislation. This roughly translates to a 4.5 dB(A) decrease in noise level. The intervention was associated with a favourable but statistically non-significant downward trend in time of the noise dose of -2.1 percentage points per year (95% CI -4.9 to 0.7, 4 year follow-up, very low-quality evidence). Engineering intervention case studiesWe found 12 studies that described 107 uncontrolled case studies of immediate reductions in noise levels of machinery ranging from 11.1 to 19.7 dB(A) as a result of purchasing new equipment, segregating noise sources or installing panels or curtains around sources. However, the studies lacked long-term follow-up and dose measurements of workers, and we did not use these studies for our conclusions. Hearing protection devicesIn general hearing protection devices reduced noise exposure on average by about 20 dB(A) in one RCT and three CBAs (57 participants, low-quality evidence). Two RCTs showed that, with instructions for insertion, the attenuation of noise by earplugs was 8.59 dB better (95% CI 6.92 dB to 10.25 dB) compared to no instruction (2 RCTs, 140 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Administrative controls: information and noise exposure feedbackOn-site training sessions did not have an effect on personal noise-exposure levels compared to information only in one cluster-RCT after four months' follow-up (mean difference (MD) 0.14 dB; 95% CI -2.66 to 2.38). Another arm of the same study found that personal noise exposure information had no effect on noise levels (MD 0.30 dB(A), 95% CI -2.31 to 2.91) compared to no such information (176 participants, low-quality evidence). Effects on hearing loss Hearing protection devicesIn two studies the authors compared the effect of different devices on temporary threshold shifts at short-term follow-up but reported insufficient data for analysis.

"28601814","Hearing loss associated with repeated MRI acquisition procedure-related acoustic noise exposure: an occupational cohort study.","OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of repeated exposure to MRI-related acoustic noise during image acquisition procedures (scans) on hearing.METHODS: A retrospective occupational cohort study was performed among workers of an MRI manufacturing facility (n=474). Longitudinal audiometry data from the facility's medical surveillance scheme collected from 1973 to 2010 were analysed by studying the association of cumulative exposure to MRI-related acoustic noise from voluntary (multiple) MRI scans and the hearing threshold of the volunteer.RESULTS: Repeated acoustic noise exposure during volunteer MRI scans was found to be associated with a small exposure-dependent increased rate change of hearing threshold level (dB/year), but the association was only found related to the number of voluntary MRI scans and not to modelled cumulative noise exposure (dB*hour) based on MRI-system type. The increased rate change of hearing threshold level was found to be statistically significant for the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000<U+2009>Hz in the right ear.CONCLUSIONS: From our longitudinal cohort study, it appeared that exposure to noise from voluntarily MRI scans may have resulted in a slight amount of hearing loss. Mandatory use of hearing protection might have prevented more severe hearing loss. Lack of consistency in findings between the left and right ears and between the two exposure measures prohibits definitive conclusions. Further research that addresses the study's methodological limitations is warranted to corroborate our findings."

"28485295","Hearing loss in mild OSAS and simple snoring patients.","Introduction Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of prolonged partial or complete obstruction of the upper airways. Several study groups studied the effect of snoring and OSAS on auditory function, showing an increase in the incidence of hearing loss in apneic patients, an earlier onset and/or a degree of hearing loss deeper than in peers. The aim of our study is to evaluate the audiological performance of a population of simple-snoring patients and patients suffering from mild OSAS, and the impact that such pathological condition can have on the auditory function, considering the significant levels of chronic noise. Materials and Methods Data was collected by analyzing audiometric exams on snoring patients and a control group of non-snoring patients. Our study included simple snoring patients without OSAS (AHI &amp;lt; 5) or with low level of OSAS (5&amp;lt; AHI &amp;lt; 15). Possible hearing loss was classified in a crescent scale (A-B-C-D-E), from greater to minor auditory performance, according to the indications of the national protocol of occupational medicine for evaluation of hearing loss in patients exposed to chronic noise. Results We have found independence between simple snorers, mild-OSAS snorers and non-snoring patients compared to the scale of hearing performance classification. Conclusions Our results show a distribution of hearing loss in the different groups that appear independent of the presence or absence of snoring, complicated or uncomplicated by mild OSAS."
"28273319","Cross-sectional evaluation of an internet-based hearing screening test in an occupational setting.","Objectives The Occupational Earcheck (OEC) is an online internet test to detect high-frequency hearing loss for the purposes of occupational hearing screening. In this study, we evaluated the OEC in an occupational setting in order to assess test sensitivity, specificity, and validity. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2015, in which the optimized OEC was evaluated on 94 employees from the army and three different companies in construction and manufacturing. Subjects underwent OEC in an office-like room. Pure-tone air conduction audiometry was performed as a reference test. The OEC was repeated for a subset of subjects (N=19). Important test characteristics (ie, sensitivity and specificity, test validity, and test-retest reliability) were assessed. Results When analyzed on the individual level, the sensitivity and specificity of OEC were 90% and 77%, respectively. The speech reception threshold results correlated strongly with the pure-tone average of the frequencies 3, 4 and 6 kHz, reflecting good test validity (r=0.79). The difference between test and retest was not significant. The intra-class correlation coefficient was moderate (r=0.57), indicating a reasonable agreement between test and retest. Conclusions The OEC appears to be a suitable test for the detection of high-frequency hearing loss among noise-exposed employees, with good sensitivity and specificity values, even when performed in a semi-controlled occupational setting, though a possible learning effect should be taken into account."

Baseline of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil).","OBJECTIVES: Although several studies have investigated the effects of diabetes on hearing loss, the relationship between these two conditions remains unclear. Some studies have suggested that diabetes may cause sensorineural hearing loss, whereas others have failed to find an association. The biggest challenge in investigating the association between diabetes and hearing loss is the presence of confounding variables and the complexity of the auditory system. Our study investigated the association between diabetes and sensorineural hearing loss. We evaluated the influence of time from diabetes diagnosis on this association after controlling for age, gender, and hypertension diagnosis and excluding those subjects with exposure to noise.METHODS: This cross-sectional study evaluated 901 adult and elderly Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) participants from São Paulo, Brazil who underwent audiometry testing as part of ELSA-Brasil's baseline assessment.RESULTS: Hearing thresholds and speech test results were significantly worse in the group with diabetes than in the group without diabetes. However, no significant differences were found between participants with and without diabetes after adjusting for age, gender, and the presence of hypertension. Hearing thresholds were not affected by occupational noise exposure in the groups with and without diabetes. In addition, no association between the duration of diabetes and hearing thresholds was observed after adjusting for age, gender, and hypertension.CONCLUSION: We found no association between the duration of diabetes and worse hearing thresholds after models were adjusted for age, gender, and the presence of hypertension."

The control group included 67 subjects, non-music students and non-musicians, aged 22.8±3.3 years. Data on the study subjects' musical experience, instruments in use, time of weekly practice and additional risk factors for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) were identified by means of a questionnaire survey. Sound pressure levels produced by various groups of instruments during solo and group playing were also measured and analyzed. The music students' audiometric hearing threshold levels (HTLs) were compared with the theoretical predictions calculated according to the International Organization for Standardization standard ISO 1999:2013.RESULTS: It was estimated that the music students were exposed for 27.1±14.3 h/week to sounds at the A-weighted equivalent-continuous sound pressure level of 89.9±6.0 dB. There were no significant differences in HTLs between the music students and the control group in the frequency range of 4000-8000 Hz. Furthermore, in each group HTLs in the frequency range 1000-8000 Hz did not exceed 20 dB HL in 83% of the examined ears. Nevertheless, high frequency notched audiograms typical of the noise-induced hearing loss were found in 13.4% and 9% of the musicians and non-musicians, respectively. The odds ratio (OR) of notching in the music students increased significantly along with higher sound pressure levels (OR = 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.014-1.13, p &lt; 0.05). The students' HTLs were worse (higher) than those of a highly screened non-noise-exposed population. Moreover, their hearing loss was less severe than that expected from sound exposure for frequencies of 3000 Hz and 4000 Hz, and it was more severe in the case of frequency of 6000 Hz.CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the need for further studies and development of a hearing conservation program for music students.

"28111321","Development and validation of the Speech Reception in Noise (SPRINT) Test.","Since 1992, the Speech Recognition in Noise Test, or SPRINT, has been the standard speech-in-noise test for assessing auditory fitness-for-duty of US Army Soldiers with hearing loss. The original SPRINT test consisted of 200 monosyllabic words presented at a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of +9 dB in the presence of a six-talker babble noise. Normative data for the test was collected on 319 hearing impaired Soldiers, and a procedure for making recommendations about the disposition of military personnel on the basis of their SPRINT score and their years of experience was developed and implemented as part of US Army policy. In 2013, a new 100-word version of the test was developed that eliminated words that were either too easy or too hard to make meaningful distinctions among hearing impaired listeners. This paper describes the development of the original 200-word SPRINT test, along with a description of the procedure used to reduce the 200-word test to 100 words and the results of a validation study conducted to evaluate how well the shortened 100-word test is able to capture the results from the full 200-word version of the SPRINT."

"28054909","Noise Exposure Questionnaire: A Tool for Quantifying Annual Noise Exposure.","BACKGROUND: Exposure to both occupational and nonoccupational noise is recognized as a risk factor for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Although audiologists routinely inquire regarding history of noise exposure, there are limited tools available for quantifying this history or for identifying those individuals who are at highest risk for NIHL. Identifying those at highest risk would allow hearing conservation activities to be focused on those individuals.PURPOSE: To develop a detailed, task-based questionnaire for quantifying an individual's annual noise exposure (ANE) arising from both occupational and nonoccupational sources (aim 1) and to develop a short screening tool that could be used to identify individuals at high risk of NIHL (aim 2).RESEARCH DESIGN: Review of relevant literature for questionnaire development followed by a cross-sectional descriptive and correlational investigation of the newly developed questionnaire and screening tool.STUDY SAMPLE: One hundred fourteen college freshmen completed the detailed questionnaire for estimating ANE (aim 1) and answered the potential screening questions (aim 2). An additional 59 adults participated in data collection where the accuracy of the screening tool was evaluated (aim 2).DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: In study aim 1, all participants completed the detailed questionnaire and the potential screening questions. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify participant participation in various noisy activities and their associated ANE estimates. In study aim 2, linear regression techniques were used to identify screening questions that could be used to predict a participant's estimated ANE. Clinical decision theory was then used to assess the accuracy with which the screening tool predicted high and low risk of NIHL in a new group of participants.RESULTS: Responses on the detailed questionnaire indicated that our sample of college freshmen reported high rates of participation in a variety of occupational and nonoccupational activities associated with high sound levels. Although participation rates were high, ANE estimates were below highest-risk levels for many participants because the frequency of participation in these activities was low in many cases. These data illustrate how the Noise Exposure Questionnaire (NEQ) could be used to provide detailed and specific information regarding an individual's exposure to noise. The results of aim 2 suggest that the screening tool, the 1-Minute Noise Screen, can be used to identify those participants with high- and low-risk noise exposure, allowing more in-depth assessment of noise exposure history to be targeted at those most at risk.CONCLUSIONS: The NEQ can be used to estimate an individual's ANE and the 1-Minute Noise Screen can be used to identify those participants at highest risk of NIHL. These tools allow audiologists to focus hearing conservation efforts on those individuals who are most in need of those services."

Occupational noise exposure was defined as hazardous when communicating with coworkers at an arm's length distance required speaking in a raised voice.RESULTS: An estimated 42% of respondents reported hazardous occupational noise exposure; 10 years or more was associated with HL regardless of age, sex or education. Absent DPOAEs, tinnitus, and the Wilson audiometric notch were significantly more prevalent in hazardous workplace noise-exposed workers than in nonexposed. When mandatory, 80% reported wearing hearing protection.CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with other industrialized countries, underscoring the need for ongoing awareness of noise-induced occupational HL."
"29928918","Combined exposure to carbon disulfide and low-frequency noise reversibly affects vestibular function.","Chronic occupational exposure to carbon disulfide (CS2) has debilitating motor and sensory effects in humans, which can increase the risk of falls. Although no mention of vestibulotoxic effects is contained in the literature, epidemiological and experimental data suggest that CS2 could cause low-frequency hearing loss when associated with noise exposure. Low-frequency noise might also perturb the peripheral balance receptor through an as-yet unclear mechanism. Here, we studied how exposure to a low-frequency noise combined with 250-ppm CS2 affected balance in rats. Vestibular function was tested based on post-rotary nystagmus recorded by a video-oculography system. These measurements were completed by behavioral tests and analysis of the cerebellum to measure expression levels for gene expression associated with neurotoxicity. Assays were performed prior to and following a 4-week exposure, and again after a 4-week recovery period. Functional measurements were completed by histological analyses of the peripheral organs.Nystagmus was unaltered by exposure to noise alone, while CS2 alone caused a moderate 19% decrease of the saccade number. In contrast, coexposure to 250-ppm CS2 and low-frequency noise decreased both saccade number and duration by 33% and 34%, respectively. After four weeks, recovery was only partial but measures were not significantly different from pre-exposure values. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis of cerebellar tissue revealed a slight but significant modification in expression levels for two genes linked to neurotoxicity in CS2-exposed animals. However, neither histopathological changes to the peripheral receptor nor behavioral differences were observed. Based on all these results, we propose that the effects of CS2 were due to reversible neurochemical disturbance of the efferent pathways managing post-rotatory nystagmus. Because the nervous structures involving the vestibular function appear particularly sensitive to CS2, post-rotary nystagmus could be used as an early, non-invasive measurement to diagnose CS2 intoxication as part of an occupational conservation program."

Define a means of using these predictions for objective occupational hearing screening for hearing-critical public safety and law enforcement jobs.DESIGN: Analyses of predicted and measured speech intelligibility in recordings of real-world noise environments were performed in two studies using speech recognition thresholds (SRTs) and intelligibility measures. ESII analyses of the recordings were used to predict intelligibility. Noise recordings were made in prison environments and at US Army facilities for training ground and airborne forces. Speech materials included full bandwidth sentences and bandpass filtered sentences that simulated radio transmissions.STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 22 adults with normal hearing (NH) and 15 with mild-moderate hearing impairment (HI) participated in the two studies.CONCLUSIONS: An individual's SRT and audiogram can accurately predict the likelihood of effective speech communication in noise environments with known ESII characteristics, where essential hearing-critical tasks are performed.

"29625029","How Much Noise Is an Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon Exposed to?","PURPOSE: A common concern among oral and maxillofacial surgeons (OMSs) is progressive hearing loss throughout their careers. Although this has not been critically studied, there could be several factors that contribute to this detriment, including drills, saws, suction, music, and other sounds within the closed operating environment. This study observed the intensity of noise in operating rooms (ORs) and clinical settings during the use of drills, saws, surgical handpieces, and other tools.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, sound intensities were measured in decibels using a CEM DT-8851 industrial high-accuracy digital sound noise level meter data logger in clinics and ORs. The device measured sound intensities during the entire duration of the procedures. The recorded drilling periods were extracted from the data and t tests were run to determine whether a statistically relevant difference existed between the non-drilling and drilling periods. In addition, the duration during which intensity was greater than or equal to 85 dB was measured.RESULTS: Fifty procedures were recorded in the clinical setting and 50 were recorded in the OR. The results of this study proved that OMSs were indeed exposed to sound intensities in decibels that exceeded Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines, but these exposures occurred less than 1% of the time. The maximum recorded intensities in the clinic and OR were during a non-drilling period and these were attributed to suction.CONCLUSION: OSHA guidelines were exceeded in clinical and OR settings, but the results were not relevant. The authors believe this is a very promising study for future endeavors. They found that the threshold set by OSHA was exceeded at points during surgical procedures in the clinic and OR. This will prompt future studies focusing on recordings when suction is used and longitudinal studies of individual OMSs."

The outcomes of interest were raw change in hearing sensitivity from initial baseline to 2013 audiogram and initial occurrence of a significant threshold shift (STS) and non-H1 audiogram profile. Potential predictor variables included age and elapsed time in cohort for each audiogram, gender, and Air Force Specialty Code. Random forest analyses conducted on a learning sample were used to identify relevant predictor variables. Mixed effects models were fitted to a separate validation sample to make statistical inferences.RESULTS: The final dataset included 167,253 nonbaseline audiograms on 10,567 participants. Only the interaction between time since baseline audiogram and age was significantly associated with raw change in hearing sensitivity by STS metric. None of the potential predictors were associated with the likelihood for an STS. Time since baseline audiogram, age, and their interaction were significantly associated with the likelihood for a non-HI hearing profile.DISCUSSION: In this study population, age and elapsed time since baseline audiogram were modestly associated with decreased hearing sensitivity and increased likelihood for a non-H1 hearing profile. Aircraft type, as determined from Air Force Specialty Code, was not associated with changes in hearing sensitivity by STS metric.Greenwell BM, Tvaryanas AP, Maupin GM.

"29457603","The hearing of rural workers exposed to noise and pesticides.","n work environments, different physical and chemical agents that may pose a risk to workers' hearing health coexist. In this context, occupational hearing loss stands out. It has mostly been attributed to only noise exposure, although there are other agents, that is, pesticides that might contribute to occupational hearing loss. In this report, two cases will be presented that consider rural workers exposed to pesticides and intense noise generated by an adapted rudimentary vehicle. The noise measured in this vehicle was 88.3 dBA up to 93.4 dBA. Pure-tone audiometry, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, and high-frequency audiometry tests were performed. This report is unusual because of the short time of exposure to noise and pesticides and the hearing loss found, indicating a synergy between those agents."
